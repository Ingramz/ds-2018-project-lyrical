Snoop Dogg,"We confined to these wordly ways, it's unchanging
The money makes, murder the kids, and gangbangin
The stock market crashed, they watchin my black ass
You pop em for fast cash so we dies over dollars
Get wise hold the knowledge, we rides know the choices
The key to the future, the devil he wanna shoot ya
Fuck em they call us niggs I'm tryin to make a livin
Do some touchin, you know I'm pretty good with the bustin
Trustin nothin you can buy if your money in discretion
We'll beat you and car jacks and leave you wit a concussion
We the gang, we mash and blast and maintain
Still the same, just fuckin wit a brand new thang
Bang, bang, take that, nigga 'fore we skirt out
Aint gotta say shit already put the word out
Ya heard how the thang goes down around us
We playas, so haters can't clown around us
On point, big fat blunts and joints
And get drunk, this cold world, they aint givin a fuck
About you livin let alone you livin it up
Niggas is stuck, I'm tryin to keep my head above water
Not stressed about dyin for a quarter in a shorter
My time get the heart of my rhymes, get a nigga get better with time
And wonderin how I'm goin by, can't help it in the heat of the
Heartless hood, it's all good

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life

It's all sowed up, in the LBC
Bitches breakin bread when they see the lil ass gee
I keeps my finga on the trigga cuz I'm down for this bangin shit
Quick to do it for the cause bitch I smash for my dogs
So don't get close to my nine
Cuz if you do you in store to see your nigga do the crime
Sirens goin off, niggas bowin down
Now you know about to rip gut fools ready to clown
Nigga fuck you bitches, and you hoes and you sluts
You tricks don't know what the fuck's up
On the eastside we ride, nigga 24 / 9
Tryin to keep my hands on somethin nigga at all times
Ready for war now that my pockets got bigger
You other fools die when I ride for my niggas
Cuss, bust, and fuss and kick up dust
What you laughin at nigga don't get your bitch ass rushed

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life

As a child I was wild as fuck, and down to dump
And kept a sawed off brown to pump
And my reputation never takin time to thank
Role models, holdin bottles, as we ride and drink
Livin right and plottin how to come up off the bottom
Black stockings in our pockets and I pocket profits
Fuck a school, I tuck a tool and start steppin
First lesson, aint no question, you gotta have protection
Sheets on the streets showin niggas defeats
And most beef don't cease 'til the trigga release
Livin hard, givin scars, gettin noise from hustlin
Slangin gangbangin run a game in musslin
Trustin nothin, sayin fuck it is the slogan
Everywhere we go we off the chronic and the potion
>From the ocean to the city to the valley to the bay
Niggas on the mission for the cabbage every day
Cutthroats, gunsmoke, dope and hoes
What controls niggas souls on the streets I roll
Bold letters think the gangs where I bang is at
Saints, Cowboys, Steelers and Raider hats
Though I know we all the same no matter what we claim
If you a nigga you a nigga and that aint gon change
We love Martin Luther King but respected Malcolm
Cuz he didn't give a fuck about the outcome

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life",N***a 4 Life,2000

LB, QB, DP, GC P
Boy, my boys, the toys, the noise
Them Eastside boys is the real McCoys
We walkin through the projects sippin on a 40
Rippin, dippin, and spittin at your shorty
You may think I'm outta bounds but I think I'm in
I holla at my folks before I step on in
Spit at my nigga Andy Hilfiger
Slide up in the garden, next to Steve Martin
We settin up shop on the east coast now
Dogghouse nigga, the big bow wow
And we higher than a motherfucker, east side up
Like this and like that motherfucker
Eastdide

So wide you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it, now
So high you can't get over it
I just want to make your day

Wakin up late off a fucked up day
I was in Dogg sippin, straight DoggHouse crippin
Fuck wit us and get that ass bombed out
Need some smoke, for the homies from the south
This is what it's all about
It's the city of the beach where the gangsters bang
Sam wake that ass up, get fresh, let's do some thangs
Swerve through the eastside Loc, scoop up the homies
Bang them other fools cuz them busters don't know me
It seems like this is my only chance to get rich
Invest in my chips, never chippin off a bitch
Trip, bring that bomb to me
Underwater with cocaine, crackin with P O P
Up, up, up in smoke, you can hit it in a bong
I'm faded like Cheech and Chong
Watch out for the second hand smoke

Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah
Representin mines to be a true Eastsidah
Survival of the fittest, how we live this shit
Fuck a bitch, dump a clip, out to get them chips
No restrictions, takin off as soon as friction
Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in
Pimp wearin khaki suits and stacy biscuits
And known like Capone to them gangsta bitches
Keep em workin somethin everywhere we go
Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe
West coast to the fullest but I bang the east
Mad motherfuckers side to that city Long Beach
So throw them gang signs up when you see me ride up
And know for sure I'm bouta throw the eastside up
And if a nigga got beef with that
That's where his ass'll be sleepin at

Lets take it back on these niggas Soopafly
Show em what that Eastside LBC DPG like

Do you remember Wallabies and Crocusacks
Relicts gun pellets and blue golf hats
Racing tracks freaks with bats
Its been a tight rap and the say he got capped
Your city of your  corner was the center of the map
Back then we scrapped
The G's know the happs
I was only fourteen playing quarterback
Five years before I bought my first Crodusack
It just bat around a homeboys spot
Damn cuz the spot getting hot
One more fresh vest in our hood
I stole a Turkish rope with the homie no good
Squabbled with some Eses
He got what I got too
Be the nigga I was feeling suit
Back then we really didn't give a fuck about nothing
Bust a nigga's ass off just for saying a little something

Kurupt was always taught not to love a dumb bitch
But in '85 I was in love with some dumb bitch
I was headed on my way to the L.A. grounds
Told my mama car eight six L.A. bound
Jacks and cracks sacks dees and latch
Old G's from way back this is where its at
Im gonna show you how the west coast rocks the night
Not giving a fuck this how I choose to live my life
For graduating I went Lousiana and split
At the age of seventeen not giving a shit
Then I grew up threw up
What I threw up
Doggpound Gangsta Crip
Great blew up
The gang like pounds of C4

Well I was twelve raised in hell
Always had a lot of time
After school chasing girls
Skinny with a curl
Tough skills were on
Doing wrong
Playing with his bone
Still standing strong

I still wear the same pair of khakis least three days
Nappy ass french braids and it ain't no thang
Hang with motherfuckers wanted for all types of crimes
Plus them little bitty niggas on they bikes wit nines
On the grind no I rhyme nigga times is hard
Got jugs of water buried all across my yard
One time on my line tryin ta find a cause
Toss a nigga in the street and reach up under my balls
Guns cocked, mug shots, cell blocks and locked down
But I done made it too far to stop now
Results of a banger, to most I'ma danger
No hope for those who come to close to the chamber
Bitches lovin I'ma gangster so fuck it
No matta if I hafta I get at em in a bucket
Tuckin in my shirt and all that shit don't work
First look, say I'ma crook that did dirt for the turf
High talk, high walk, when I stalk the street
Gurantee who try to see me come across the feet
It's a eastside lifestyle, wild and foul
Goin out, puttin it down sayin fuck the trial
Aim is to be famous wit major loot
A gang of juice, in case I gots to bring the troops
And everybody know the eastside the craziest
So motherfuckers know it ain't no fadin this

Snoop Dogg,"Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court
With trumped up charges against my client
Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather
For 227 counts of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's

The anti-player has filed and submitted
An alpha-davit in the Game Court

He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip

The black car drive by then you get capped on

I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gone make it through

I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, 
""Don't worry about what the fuck I be doin'""
We was makin' chemistry, but who is he?
And how this nigga know the deal about you and me?

Thought you could've

I gave you everything that you needed

Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty, your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, asking why he kissed me
Stop whining, just to cry and get the macking daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is acting crabby
That's why he bagged me

No stressing over chicks, problem? Bet I solve it fastly

You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushing and shoving, kissing and hugging
Thugging, dig it, dug-in
I'm loving every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh

You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out

Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was fronting I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy

Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the wrong tracks
At an early age man
I was on the block
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get going
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-moma's house 
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfucking first telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up cause she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and applause
And I put my hand on my balls and said what's up dog

[Chorus]

I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperon plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Top cat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fucking with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fell in love with my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you ain't shit but dirt for dirt (bitch!)

So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e
C-p-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick
Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!",Lay Low,2000

Check this out

[Snoop]
I'm the kind of g that everybody knows
But I'm so low key when it comes to hoes
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes
All my friends and foes know that's just how it goes
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time
There's so much to say with so little time but I like it
Yes I like it
I'm goin' dip dive socialize and get high
I wish my people had other ways
I'm thankful that a brother's paid that a brother's paid
But how can I be happy my hair is still nappy
I miss my grand pappy
I want to do right but the world is wrong
That's why I'm singin' this song

[Chorus]
I'm trying to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
Y'all niggas better leave me alone I think you better leave me alone

There's so much going on out there in the world today

They turn out to be snitches bitches yeah they switches
But you know like I know I can't stop doing what I got to do
I'ma keep doing what I got to I'ma keep doing y'know
Everywhere I go the game is the same
People looking at me want me to say something
Want me to do something but I don't know nothing
If I ain't getting paid I can't drop no rhymes
I can't do nothing for you no mo' I ain't got that kinda time
And they know

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I try to be to myself and try to stay away from the world
But the world just keeps running after me running after me
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness
But somehow the wickedness is in my circle what am I to do
I try to ask god to help me get through this
What am I to do to this just do this let's do this
So I continue to mash day by day day by day
I continue to play play by play
And I continue to spit my manuscript spit it
And say what I want to say say it
And I do it to ya every day

[Snoop Dogg (Butch Cassidy)]
Now who would ever think that I wanted her home?
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin' somethin' on the side? It didn't make sense
(I'm a family man sportin' a wedding band)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gone make it through
(The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in)
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker, 
""Don't worry about what the fuck I be doin'""
We was makin' chemistry, but who is he?
And how this nigga know the deal about you and me?
(I fell to my knees and asked the girl ""Why?"")
She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
I was in love at times
They say game don't wait, ha Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin' my time while I'm writin' these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin' wines
Girl, you's a dime
Got me losin' my mind
Well if lovin' you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that ""This was the way love was meant to be""
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never,
Thought you could've
Up out the hood-uh
Is where I took you
Never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
You know what girl?
I was in love with you and you treated me like that,
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

[Butch Cassidy]
How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin' up my songs
Now a nigga must move on
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me
Had a nigga sick for weeks
Now I must begin my streak",Loosen' Control,2000

Throwin' up high in the sky
Known you pissed off

It ain't no fakin of mine
It's what I place on the line
Paper chase is a crime
So ain't takin' no time
It's all out till I fall out, full assault
I want it all like my dog, fresh socks and growth
Bitches jockin' how I ball, shit drops the chrome
Blazin' chronic, sippin' tonic, how we live for the three

It's kill or be killed, but them niggas can't find me

Guess what? OG, in the game of rap
And everytime that i see 'em, I get a nigga dept
what's up, to my partners Tray Deee and Goldie Loc
Quick motherfuckin' niggas, always gon' smoke
In the concrete jungle, man you know where it's at
It's the place, where you want to leave, don't want to be at
Believe that, you can check in, but you can't check out
Like Rae, everybody doin' their own shit to get paid
You might die, but it all, goes along with the job
Even ride, do whatever it takes to survive
You a bitch! If you snitch on your friends
But you a true motherfucker, you don't fuck with the pigs

Shaky ass nigga, know how to fuck when we trust you
We're the cashy, ashes to ash to ashy, dust to dust
I bust when I'm here, when heat flashes
My heat sends heat strokes, my scraps put the senorita
Make niggaz choke like inhalin, end up the smoke
So take one tote off the automatic I got stashed in my coat
Under pressure, I come to test ya, extra
Holdin every rough texture, rough rhymin texture
Expect a, next a, hittin balls to hard balls some check ya
The romantic buildin is the beginnin of ya destiny
Destined to fall, praise to me and D-A-Z
We mash, leave no flaws, we break jaws
Smoke all the chronic wit Daz and my nigga Doggy Dogg

This is how I am, this is my mentally
Don't try to battle me, I cause fatalities
And this is how it is when the microphone put to torture
MC's done tried to step but I caught ya
I'm like a sorcerer, magical with rhymes
I'm one of a kind, my lines too inclined for your mind
And that's the way it is, you can't see me so don't even try
I wonder why MC's done tried to step in and they died
Now I be that MC, you can't see that
Lyricist that breaks MC's backs
Matter of a fact that ain't the way you should do it
This is how it is in showbiz
I know this MC can't even get close
Cause I rock shit from the west to the east coast

Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
Kurupt tell me, why they wanna fuck
Now I'm rollin in the fast lane tryin to find the right lane
I'm spittin game like big pimpin is my name
I need a flame, so I can get this shit lit
Its snoop dogg, I'm bout to drop me a hit
I got my nigga named kingpin to the right
And we plan on smoking all night
And when we through my nigga named priest gon increase the peace
Blaze up another sack, get your kakies creased
Cause its on and poppin, ain't no stopping
Snoop is on the mic I'm lyrically hoppin
Poppin just like a motherfuckin strap
Don't talk shit cause your best to watch your back
Because umm, why you sleepin we creepin
And um, we got a fat sack of blueberries, its scary
My brother jerry told me one day
He said snoop when you reach the top will you please blaze a J
For me and my homie J d-o-g, who's in the penitentiary but see
Its still cool to me cause Ima swing it on bring it on
Got another fat sack so blaze up the ozone

So motherfuckin back off or jack off for my smoke, smoke, smoke

Spit out gangsta shit like haa chooo

Tha relatives, how gangsta is that
Half my life blowin do do wit a strap in my lap
Just goin out the ills and its hurtin niggaz
Kickin niggaz door down and searchin niggaz
In the fence for a week and its perkin niggaz
You niggaz ain't some gangstaz you some working niggaz
Ain't no mo silent niggaz
My prediction, 2004 there's gon be hoes and snitchin niggaz
Or peepin niggaz out the barrel of a 40
Hood on hood crime, homies killing homies

?? to harlem, chips flippin we ballin
Ain't nuttin better than being young gangsta and ballin
Blowed outta mind, probably be the high some more
Master money marna for the law
I'm from the salty 619, home of the corca
Mystica holders with pistolas and purple morta
Americas finest find me north of tha border
Please, no seeds, break bread cost an awful lot
Chay flag on a borca, slide in croca's
Splitters or the swishers, twisters, hundred sport cars
This for big tony, homey in the yinta
Inglewood to tango, relativez the bleeka

Somebody tell me Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
They say no to dope, and ugh to drugs

I'm tired of that punk shit
Where niggaz claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggaz rip glocks

It's time to research the documents and pull some files
And put it down with this gangsta style
'Cause I be seein niggaz bein more aggressive now
After peace treaty meetings and the weapons down

Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check

Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
Niggaz have done did when the steel'll blast

Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots and the cops and control your block

Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin all the activity
That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies

So death to all my enemies
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy

On my nuts without bucks like Marvin
You can't sleep, you can't eat, look who starvin
Written bill paid but still gotta be a slave
Flip your own money, make your own proper

Get yo' own heat, in case some niggaz try to stop ya
Be a boss hog about your money, float loc
And trust no one, anybody can get smoke smoked
Like a fat-ass blunt, of that bomb shit

Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!

If you didn't see 'em it's the Eastside boys
We be mobbin, like a motherfuckin cut

Dirty dealt, lil' sag, lil' jay, lil' Chuck
Two times, trey times on yo' motherfuckin ass
Keep it O.G. nigga, rewind and pass
It's just another day and forty dozen, niggaz strugglin

If so, grab a nine and start to trip
But remember, don't let nobody punk you out yo' grip nigga

Two days later, I'm running my mouth
Mom's put a bottle to my grill
I look her in the face and I say chill
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hos-pital
On my way to the liquor store
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll
But before I get out the door
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo
He picks me up and sit me on the seat
And then he get the phone and get to dialin' the police
I'm on the run but I can't walk yet
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet
First trip in the police car
Cameras all around me as if I was a star
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)

That's what I'ma name you cause boy you be snoopin'

Twenty days later I'm from are-T-see
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck

Snoop Dogg,"And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic

Blow out life what's left is death
Now i can go on or i can g or make a right
Whatever way that i turn its still death after life
It don't discourage me, i ain't got nuthin to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But i learn 'cause i see, and i earn 'cause i g
But these problems probably havin niggaz prayin to see

Just yesterday I had to turn a bitch away
I got to many on my side - I got to many in my face
Come ride with me
Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen
that's the way that its supposed to be
When you do see me
Mobbin wit a gangsta lean
Got a piece by my side
You can ride baby close your eyes girl

[Chorus: Nate Dogg, Butch Cassidy, & Kokane]
I'm so cool
Cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool

[Butch Cassidy]
It's me I'm back again
It's never gonna end
I know why'all heard it all before
I just gotta give ya more
Catch me rollin in the night
If I turn off my lights
The eastsidaz in the game
You hear my voice and know my name
You should bang this down on your block
All through your hood
Burnin trees...burnin trees
Ladies let the music run right through you
Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy

[Chorus]
[Tray-Dee]
I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up
Take this move, this groove and still G it up
Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke
Pimpin hoes down south, back east to west coast
I'm Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze
Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez
Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride
As I exit I step with my stacey shine
I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool
Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back
Now let me break it down a notch
Smooth like I do when I pound the cock
We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block
Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot
We so cool now

[Kokane & Goldie Loc]
If everybody turn there radios on at twelve o'clock
We'll make the world pop

[Goldie Loc]
It's too good right now
Blunkey blunkey
Remmey remmey
Plenty gumbo
Snoop gimme some mo'
Swakin that like a damn fool
Acedemics stacey adams feelin way to cool
there's a lot things that make me want to frown though
But I'm grinnin like a motherfucka
Throwin dogg pound up
Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet
It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats
I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much
Talk shit to the homies 'cause they know what's up
As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle
Still got patience still makin niggaz
I just want to be myself
What I receive from the homies is help
We had a conversation today about who ain't pitchin in
Keep suckas away that don't fit in
I'm so cool

Snoop Dogg,"1998, Dogghouse Records steps on the scene
Unlike any other record label, we plan to get green
And keep it clean and stay oh, so mean
So rough, so tough

What is it? This for them, suckas
Nigga, I came from a long line of playas
That ain't scared of nar' one of y'all, motherfuckers
I see these niggas wanna see me catch a case and get struck out
But I'm laughin' 'bout to knock they ass the fuck out

Bitch, quit actin' like a stuck up clown
That's why yo raggety ass attitude is fucked up now
Suga Free, bitch swingin' on my dick sayin', wee
The pimpin' is crackin' so I feel like mackin' tonight
(Aight)

Now them seventy niggas? Thirty gon' hate us
That's why I play the role, keep control
And throw them off wit' these dirty gators
See time was torn

'cause if I bought me somethin' to eat, shit
I bought you somethin' too, what's mine is yours
But now you'd rather bring me down and see me fall
Walkin' wit my head down, straight, dependin' on y'all

The call me Honcho, I like to sparkle
I'm 'bout to barbecue a bitch like the charcoal
Am I a star? No, ya' in my car? No
My name is Soopafly, bitch so ya' all know

Now heffer don't act stupid, 'cause ya'know who I am
The nigga quick to talk shit and don't give a damn
I tell that hoe run, man that hoe better scram
I pimp across the land, better read ya' motherfuckin' press telegram

Snoop Dogg told me that
Now blow me back while I'm pimpin' on this funky track
Bang ES, we givin' it up, got the bitches singin' the rest
We blastin' motherfuckers, run up and come test

Better, hide yo chest and fasten yo vest
No bullshit, take yo bitches so quick and so fast
(So fast)
Fuck wit' us, I'll put a foot up yo ass

Collect calls from the pen so I catch it in the kitchen
The homie say, send him naked pictures of bitches
And if they talkin' backwards, he'll have a homie's jack up
That nigga fucked Pat up, fuck havin' a homies tack up

We slap hoes that step on toes of our dada's
And ask them niggas in the Source Awards
When I caught them while y'all was pacin', the homies
Was bringin' up situations, eliminating fake niggas while I'm paper chasin'

Trap or dap and clap niggas, I'm young gottstra

For shizzle my nigga Kurizzle was nizzle my nigga
Like a bitch or a busta, bust a, four fizzle
Surface the air miss wit a homie, wait for the whistle

Before everybody feel the fire from the five's
I told Daz we about to fry niggas like fries
And separate them by five's and light up the skies

Cannot work or see the tears of a clown

But I'ma tell 'em Lil' Goldie don't play, nigga

Yeah, it's the genius of the click
Known to sleep a nigga quick
So watch how ya' gums bump speakin' on the wrist
I drew the diagram how to mash the game
Never hesitated when it came to blasting thangs

From the knuckle shoes buckle when we lock and strap
I'm a real rider nigga you can drop the act
I got stripes and bars from a life at war
Twice as hard, as niggas claim they sheisty y'all

Criminal, lay 'em down for their stacks and sacks
For the mic, used to trife with the mass and gats
Do or die to survive from my time of birth
Then I'm out for gettin' mine till I ride the hearse

It's going down, Dogghouse gangsta style
And fuck death row, we'll take 'em out
We got the whole rap game bangin' now

Keep it on the low low, fuck that gang bang

It's easy to see (what) that I'm a motherfuckin ghetto ass G, can't fuck wit me
Do it do it, loco 'til your casket drop

You think you can see me, I know you motherfuckers wanna be me
Light it up, blaze it up, ain't no need for chokin
If I had anotha blunt wrap I'd be smokin
Locin waitin on Wreck to get back
When he get back perhaps I'm blazin up a sack
So relax, that's snaps ain't right, it's all good

Just make sure what you got insured is fine
You already know I got my money on my mind, nigga

But you know, I'm a real playa
Real hustler, real gangsta
I'm bout getting this money (late night)
I don't give a fuck what time it is
It can go down all night

Button up the honcho, grab the brownies and heat
First step, to collect a nigga's bread and meat
The squares asleep
But all the hogs out on the prowl
Blocks get locked down like they off a child
Time to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes
Checking cream off ecstasy to the green and white
Dub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks
Getcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips
Baller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss
So the hard, Bogard, and we squeezed it soft
Late night, the game tight, went up a notch or two
With fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you
Impossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming
The vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining
9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising
Occupation gangsta committed to thug life

On a late night
That's the time we gone ride
Nigga, it's do or die

We ain't checking for names
When the hollow points fly
On a late night
Deeper and deeper
We had to get into some gangsta shit

Deeper and deeper
They don't know who they fucking wit

Dead bodies with a funky smell
Throw 'em in the ocean
Jack the fo' up two times
And young nigga, keep coastin'
Turn on the DVD and watch myself on TV
It's killings after killings but they don't know it's me
It's lil' G, now what you think that stand fo?
I'm gangsta on the streets and I keep it Crippin' in the studio
Who else be up late night ready to jack like the whole house?
Gallop in yo shit like the black joust
To make it real simple and quick
If I don't have it, I gots to take yo shit
And it's all about the fast lane, nigga
When you see me on the streets, I got my finger on tha trigga
Never catch who's slippin' when I'm on them 2-wing deez
And when I get my bricks, I flood ya whole city in titties
Please believe, that I'm a lil' crazy motherfucker
Turned out by the Spillman's, Gaithen's, and Ruckas

On a late night
That's the time that we gone move a gang away

When I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes
It's a statement that I'm makin' and ain't takin' no backtalk
I'm blowin' niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough
The last thought you rappin' niggaz should think
Is you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat
On the streets over beef you don't compete with uno, you know
The general a criminal do low
Admit 'cause I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it
Niggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin'
By my presence I'm a answer to society's hate
A true rider with the mind, I pushed him outta his way
Fools petty and they ready steady comin' with bullshit
A full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick
A sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast

Now is the time
This is the place
To bang back the khakis with the church fat lace
West is the coast, east is the side

Disrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech

Niggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait
I came home straight from the pen to take your place
ain't no chase this paper comin' soon as I post up
And watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin' his dough up
Fuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up
Take the whole cut and he be sure negotiative
I'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike
Thug for life - come and catch the slug tonight
Insane mental frame feel no shame or pity
Since the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city
Trippin' gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat
Grab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep
This is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal
Kobe eatin' what he speakin' once he can't get the muzzle
Struggle hard for my title and intend to hold it
You want it? Then all invitations open

I take seven old be's put 'em in the street
Then that's seven more busta's who claim they got heat
And then it takes seven more see's before I start to reach
Then that's 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets
Tray Deee never do it easy fool so don't expect it
Niggas get checked and they sets disrespected
No question I'm all you ever thought that you was
Till you ran across the boss and now you coughin' up blood
Shoot first fools curse before they kick up dust
Clip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up
All they talkin' cause I'm chalkin' whole districts off
Since this loss a purple nigga's piss me off
Conflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched
All my comrades bomb back it's as sick as fuck

I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e
C-p-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick
Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!",Lay Low [Dirty],2001
Snoop Dogg,"Yeah nigga
I'm still fucking with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back
Still doing that shit huh Dre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E)

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E)

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E)

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the lo-lo's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back (So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Right back up in ya mothafuckin' ass, 9-5 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back up on top of thangs

Jumped in my shit, hit the switch, start smashing
Headed to another spot to fuck some more asses

Nigga quit trippin; why you flossin hittin switches?
You need to send some flicks of some bitches (aoww)
They got a nigga workin in the kitchen
Sendin young writers on a mission
I'm in and out the hole, way out of control
But shit homey, you know real dubs gon' roll
You know Gusto? That's how he got on parole
But when we catch him, you know we get the stole on

That'll do what I tell her to do, it's on the house homey
I owe you one, I'll throw you two

So break down, bitch, in a serious fashion
If the pimpin' don't kill you than I'm forced to blast ya
It's a paper thang, it ain't about the pussy and dick
It's the difference between you walkin' and you pushin' a whip
See it's a major type of paper, caper, motivator, playa, neighbor

And if if was a fifth - I'll be alright
It ain't so sippin' in my pimpin'

And I know sometime when I pee I forget to lift the seat

Nah nah, get gone
Don't forget to remind me to whoop your motherfuckin' ass as soon as we get home

In case anybody ain't reach the top, that's cause they ain't deserve to
Now shut the fuck up before I get my guns out
And I ain't playing no games
So check a nigga I ain't sayin no names

How move it, who I move, but that's what they want

I want to do some nasty thangs, want to make her scream my name
I like the girls that don't say, ""what?,"" know that she fine
Always knows her line, because she knows she's a dime
Put her on platinum chains, got her own cash and things
I like them girls, their sassy ways, sassy ways
Oh I like them girls, man I could stay there for days
Ooooooooooooooooh

But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug

Watch my floors fo' sho', hock up the kitchen
Suck me dry, let's get high, then wash the dishes
You get three wishes if you're cute and ambitious
Like Tisha and Denisha, boy them chickens was vicious
Wicked, how I kick it, I stick it in the eye
Oops, slid it on the accident
But, when I first met her she was so ???
So it made no sense why she did that for the hell of it
We did it on the wall, me and my dogg
And I met her at the mall
Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you
I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you
Make you want to come back and get another piece
And share with your peoples and tell your little niece
My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket
Ride it, divide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it

Hey yo (Ghetto Postage)
Give me something that makes a nigga want to pop his motherfuckin' collar
(With a lil' West Coast twist on it)
(Master P and Snoop, ha ha, tah dow, poppin' collars)

[Chorus: Master P & Snoop]
Pop those collars
Pop those collars
Pop those collars
That's the just the way we do it
Pop those collars
We changed the game

[Snoop]
Slid up in the door, get up in ya ho
Sippin' on some Mo with Big D from the mad ass 6-0
Stretched out on the couch with some Mary Jane
Doghouse nigga, we all in the same game
An every nigga in my click got the platinum chain
Blang, blang Doggy's Angel's same thing
Eastsidaz same thing, rip riders ask my nephew Kokane

[Master P & Snoop]
Cause game recognize game and we got it
No Limit and Dogg Pound, we rowdy, get em' up
We bang bang

[Snoop]
On this music that we make ho
In the cars, the clubs, or when we smoke dope
We drop that shit for you kin folk
And poor folks no joke, loc loc
Blaze a sack loc, bust a back stroke
And pop ya motherfuckin' collar till ya break ya back loc

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Ah dog we off the heezy
Snoop and P together for cheesy
Poppin' collars from the South to the Wizest
We off, see the tank around our nizeck
We O.G. show me love
And the Baker Boys started the buzz
Now we California livin' like Dre and Pac
And them No Limit boys, see we can't be stopped
Me and E-Feezy go way on the bizack
Remember Baby D, TRU it and Prizack
My essay homie, chop chop got the dizope
While me and Xzibit was ballin' by cizoast
I'm the black Slim Shady so don't try to play me
Turn a six into a Bentley and drive em' crazy
Roll up to Eastside back to the West
Represent Richmond, California to the South, respect

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I'll bless you before I diss you
Why y'all miss me, shit I miss you
So sweet, so sure but so low
So just let it all go, serious we sick of this
Dog homie, ask ya kids they put you up on it
On the corners they poppin' they collars
While back in the days, shit niggas used to stack they dollars
Make a nigga want to holler
Players, pimp, p-poppers, impersonators
Real rip riders, Eastsidaz and regulators
Haters come in all shapes, sizes and colors
But we on top of things so they can't get above us
Hate us or love us, we rollin' with the heat huggers
Thuggers, house party niggas fuck clubbers
With inane in my pockets, poppin' my collar pushin' and shovin'

Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
Betta be strapped wit yo shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time

Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Now, I'm holding a dove, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.
The little homies from the hood wit grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do
Didn't know we had a 22
Straight sitting behind his back
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I use to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what)
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Something for the real OG's to get wit
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up

(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?

And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murdering niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit
Niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme

What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good

I'm stacking and macking and packing a ten so
When you're slipping, I slip the clip in
But ain't no set tripping
'Cause it's Death Row, rolling like the mafia
Think about whooping some ass, but what the fuck stopping ya
Ain't nothing but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumping slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX, cell block two

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on Death Row
And now I'm serving a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Laying lain with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm coming from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W taking, no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block eight

Ayo stepping through the fog
And creeping through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Busting raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shooting at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothing but a black thing bay-bee
No I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfucking homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfucking Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat em man

And every hood showing nothing but love (it ain't nothing)
Taste buds ain't the same, for the simple brain
Should of never let me learn what millions really mean
Yea I'm a simple girl, but really don't want simple things
Keep real dogs close, hate cats with simple brains
Not ready for the collision, stay up in your lane
East coast, West coast, you still don't fucking think
Dedicate to you baby, keep your gangsta lean

You gots to be my queen, cause I'm the Big king
The one with the Big house with the Big things
Sister Eve, you blessed the whole scene
You're the queen of the team, with cream, you're so supreme
A blessing in the skies, open up your eyes
Me and you together shit, we gone collect the vibes
Exercise, and go where we want to go, stay fly
Sure and original, turn up your stereo

'Cause ain't nuttin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin' up with lint

So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin' funny
Stop smilin', 'cause still don't nuttin' move but the money
'Cause now I've learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just

Search for a 9 to 5, and if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin' this
Feelin' out of place 'cause man, do I miss

A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, 'cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream

'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the dogghouse, 'cause I'm paid in full

In the world of change, here I am
Tryin' to have some thangs
So what you need is some game to get your money man

A brand new start
Cause you realized you had never played your part
And that was smart.
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state.
See, I've been the fliest since I came out the gate

Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, cause still don't nothing move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thing
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

Niggas wanna control these hoes
You can't control these bitches
These is independent bitches these years
You can't understand the 2000 in here?
Motherfuckers wanna put they mack down
Wanna put they soder down
Let a bitch do what she wanna do
If she chose to ride wit a G
Then let her ride wit a G
The bitch don't wanna sit back and be a housewife all the time
Let the ho be what she wanna be
A real slut, and let the ho get on and make her money
You understand? I got a homey sittin' by me
Understand this nigga don't understand because he's a young nigga
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm been in the game since '85
And I know a ho don't do nothin', wanna play a nigga like 9 to 5, alright

Yikes, Shabba dabble do I can dig it baby, you know
Because these hoes, they can't be controlled
You gotta find 'em, spot 'em, send 'em, get em, got 'em, you know

[Chorus]
It wasn't (uh uh) your fault (it wasn't your fault)
You was only tryin' to be nice (tryin' be nice)
Only tryin to be nice, ohh (can't be nice to these hoes)
You know you can't control these hoes (no, no, no)
You know you can't control these hoes (can't control these hoes)
You know you can't control these hoes

What she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two
That's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do
But instead of goin' 'upside da head'
You bought her a 5 karat wit your bread
And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head
I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do
When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do
What we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight
It's on you, see you can take her out and buy her all types of things
You's a fool, cause when she leave you, for what he do
You'll see fool

[Chorus]

Me and you, that's what you thought 'til your ass got caught
Shame on you, and now I understand why my momma used to tell me that
Ain't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat
Game on you, cause now you back at your momma house
And you sleepin' on tha copeasack
What's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac
Say it ain't true, she let a nigga drive it, ask tha homie Battlecat
What you do, put my foot in her ass and mashed tha gas
You know me, and ever since that day my nigga, I've been P I M P

[Chorus]

That's your boo, but she know every nigga in the Roc-A-Fella Crew
That's on you, baby blow too much, I mean she know too much
That's my boo, it's all about who she did and where she been
I love you, you shouldn't a told her that, you should a smacked her flat
Shame on you (shame on you), your so in love you fittin' to get a tattoo
That ain't cool (that ain't cool), love is blind and no friend of mine
If I was you, I'd a packed her bags and bust anotha bitch that's bad

Oh you like pussy, congratulations
I'm trying to get your ass in my congregations
I keep three hoes in my room at one time
Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't want to, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfucking wood on her
Cause I perform, a G like Warren

You know I got to bust a nut and hurry up and go
You got something that I want right now
Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail
And when I kill it big daddy, I want you to tell
Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back
This dick to your mouth, little mama like that
Fish cost too much, so I feed her sardines

Hey, what's up I came to pimp
Fur hats and fur clothes, and a razor tim
Bitch, I got it made
Just pick one of my hoes, and I got it leid
You never heard as many bitches so fast and frequent
Can I get the ends, bitch delinquents
Run my bath water, cook my meals
And shut the fuck up, when I book the deals
And iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases

Snoop Dogg,"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup,
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses

Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?

I ain't got a job now,

Snoop Dogg,"Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach
Ready to relax, kick up my feet
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I want to do
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)
Oh, nothin' just called, lookin' for some women who can fondle my balls
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that
Gimme 15 minutes, and I hit you right back)
Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed
Put one up in the air, the cops just stared
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care
Got to the tele and I slid through the door
On to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor
And what would happen next only time could tell
'Cause I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Ah! Damn!)

Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (I wanna know)
Who let these hoes in my room?

Now it was five B.A.P hoes and they look like trash
But one was midget, so we'll just say four and a half
I was stuck speechless, couldn't believe my eyes
What'd I do to deserve this unpleasant surprise?
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This is just my luck""
Then my nigga bust in like ""What the fuck!?""
(Oh shit it's Snoop!)

Who in the hell let them booger bears out they cell (Not me)
And what they doin' in ya' room? Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)
Got some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)
And told security, ""Let 'em in, with no delay"" (Ha Ha!)
So when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked
Don't mean to trip out, but bitch y'all got to dip out (Dip Out!)
Catch the elevator up one floor
Presidential with the slidin' key for the door (Oh No!)
What the fuck goin' on? Shit, all around the world Luda, then it's the same song
Them bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home

Who let these hoes in my room? (Man who let these hoes in my room man?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Who let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?

Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds
(No she didn't come through with a thong on
She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it)
You can't separate me, I'ma separate you
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew
(You filthy, nasty, sick in the head
Sitting in my dressing room with dick on ya' brain)
She said ""I want you to climb in this underwear, silly""
But I was turned off by her tupper-ware titties
(Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches
Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face
Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space
Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce)
Then it got to my head, and something reminded me
I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)

Who let these hoes in my room? (Who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (I need to know, who let these hoes in)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Ay, y'all gotta go)",Hoes in My Room,2003

One thing leading to another let the party begin

Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, and silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island

Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands giggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

But Mr. Bouncer man don't put your motherfuckin' hands on me

Can I get high without you botherin' me?

La la la la. I be smokin'
It hitten me right I'll be loakin'
Them bullshit trees you be rollin'
Barely give you a buzz, me I get high

I admit I got a problem, I keep comin' back for these
Dodo bags there not your yak or your sack o' seeds
I chill sit back on the sofa and relax my knees
And roll one up loose enough to make the backwards breathe
I blow a heavy load, you kids attract some G's.
Cause I'm a smoker, too much o' this would choke ya'
I don't mean to provoke ya, but I'm a bad influence
The musician can't operate without his instruments
My recent success gradually got your bitch convinced
Haters mad they can't look inside cause I pitched the tints
I enter the club with baggies of that chocolate
Second-hand smoke will make a nigga wanna start shit.
Sometimes I wonder where the niggas from the start went
Raise up a lighter and fuck up the whole apartment.
It's just one of the things I do in my spare time
My bad habits ain't private so I'm gon' share mine.

[Chorus: x2]

See they put their hands out cause of the way shit been
I say you niggas ain't smokin' if you don't chip in.
Listen. I waited long for these rocks to glisten
From that one-room pad without a pot to piss in
Although betrayal is not forgiven
I do this for my niggas locked up that's comin' home to lobster livin'
Hopin' the cops forbiddin'
I'm bout to buy momma her own mansion
Just so I could see her pop the ribbon.
That Cali bud's special, so special I held the blunt so long
Snoop had to tell me ""Pass the weed, Nephew""
Fuck rap I'm the wrong one to get pissed off
Cause the pope'll make you jump like criss cross.
My nigga dead and it's hard to let go,
So I'm blowin' on that wet dough, same color as Gecko
Follow hood codes and everybody in the Sentinel
We gas 'em Fuck 'em and Pass 'em what you expect hoe?

[Chorus: x2]

Said you want to blow with the best of them
Yes yes I bested them
Blazed up the purple palm tree
I told you don't mess with them
I warned them new testament
Do you wanna smoke with me? (do you wanna)

Weed rollin', G-strollin', bad-mouthin', mofucker
Law breakin' Pimp, slappin niggas for the fuck of it
Hip-hop an zip lock an rip rockin' gang banger
Thought you was an actor, thought I was a singer
Thought about ridin' but you say you wanna hang tough
D-P-G-Unit sounds like danger
You might wanna manage your anger
Hang with us and stop smokin' on the same stuff
Now lay back on the loft
This new weed that I got I call it face-off
Cause it'll blow your face off and that's a figure of speech,
My niggas a beast, on me from the west to the east, preach

But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

Come get money with me, if you curious to see
how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit

I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her

Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six

[Verse One: Guru]
From New York to Cali it remains the same
Bitch niggaz always want to go against the grain
The strong will survive, the weak shall perish
Why'all need more courage, I keep why'all nourished

Get in line, I let you know right now
You need to slow right down or you get blown right now
From what I see it's systematic how we push to addicts
Demographics make the street life hell or drastic

In the hood we see oppressive genocide
'Cause if it's on it's on, you know at least 10 men'll ride
But on the other side, corruption runs deep
I'm aware of the conspiricies, discussion is brief

They're building more prisons, spendin less on schools
On the block Smith & Wess-ons and Teflons rule
It's hard to escape it, certain laws are sacred
In this life my nigga, it's mad hard to make it

[Chorus]

[Dogg] Money is key
[Dogg] And everybody you see ain't what they claim to be
[Guru] In this life..

[Dogg] I live a treacherous life, I know I ain't right, mm
[Guru] In this life..
[Dogg] You got to keep on
[Dogg] You got to be strong, you got to hold on
[Guru] In this life, heh, I come in peace
[Guru] But still yo, I come from the streets

This one's for my sons and my lil' daughter
Peace to JMJ and my nigga Headquarters
A +GangStarr+ with a gangster, on a mission
World +Premier+, limited edition

My mind keeps driftin cause I haven't had a spliff in
A long time, I'm doin fine, I feel teriffic
I bop up the street, see-walk to the beat
It's cold outdoors, so I got to keep some heat

I never know when a cutthroat gon' try to test me
Disrespect me, things could get messy
Yes he, shoot a good game, like James
I mean Jesse, watch out nigga, heavens to Betsies

The big drum beater
With a car full of heaters and some fly senoritas
In some Stacy's or some Chucks, cause I gotsta keep it G'd up
Run up on the Dogg man you bound to get beat up

That's whiter than what's spilling down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit' the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy s***
Trying to ask me s***
When my n****s fill ya vest they ain't gon pass me s***
You should think about it, take a second
Matter fact, you should take four B
And think before you f*** wit lil' skateboard P

[Chorus]

I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a D-J
""Two!"" ""one!"" ""yep, three!"" 
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

[Chorus]

I'm a Bad Boy, with a lotta ho's
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun so you want to pop back?
AK47 now n****, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherf***ing music we crip to
Subscribe n****, get yo issue
Baby come close, let me see how you get loose!

You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about
You want the presence of pimpin, I'm walkin while limpin
And holding on the drink that I'm sippin, I'm flippin the script an'
I'm sliding while I'm dippin my whip in, out of traffic

But it be so funny cowards be wanting see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nails and burbs while you got pounds of curbs, and one of us got a play
Basically around the burbs I'm fitting like a lego block, you bullshitting
While I'm sitting in an eight o drop, these suckers tell me keep it gangsta
But they don't know, when they ain't looking I be doing population control
Then I'm looking for a breezy with a whole lot of soul so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe
To not the jada with the ?, its the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his jewelry shining all through his clothes and little tigger's
In the back on the low, but I still shine though

When I'm over there I'm in the low low with my unc and all the bitches
Looking for us but I ain't looking for puss, right now ma I'm looking for cush
And I'm strapped with the pound and ? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused
I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffel bags out on the lawn
So much money my niggas be counting it wrong, so many hits
I can't keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And ya'll still hate but we still shining let's go

(​I love, to give you light)

Yeah, first of all
Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Sing it sister
Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G
Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin' the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers and gangbangin'
And dope dealin', cold feelin' to be a product of niggas around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin'
I found myself grindin' on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin' the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a Glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggas throwin' up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin' my home, not carin' 'bout what moms what sayin
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin'
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin' just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you

And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked down
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin' thangs, ha ha
I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin' to heaven huh
And you ain't gon' go!
So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say neighbor! You ain't going!
You ain't going!",(Intro) I Love to Give You Light,2004

And put all aside the hope

[Chorus: x2]

Twinkling tinkling (?brings, blings, binds?)
We do all sorts of things
While you're in a modest place
Your conciouses only peace
Yeah I had to make peace with myself you know what I mean
I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years
So I told myself I want to know what it feels like to be high fo life
And I mean man I tell ya it feels real good 
You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother I'm telling you its a great feeling 
Can you dig that
I can dig it
More and more you grieve
(sing that song nephew)
Until you grow another need 
You claim this fantasy
You'll have no reality

[Chorus: x2]

Darling take a listen
This may be something that your missing
I know your times are funky
But you don't have to be no junkie

He who fears fate lives like a coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured

I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc using donors, dead niggas with spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snitch, an the heart of a dead nark
Niggas never see the light till it spark
Then they bleed, it get cold, then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push Me, a hundred revolvers'll get to spinning

I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!

Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it

Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded

Snoop Dogg,"Say man ay ushers, deacons, lock the do'

I love, to give you light

Geah, first of all, givin' honor to God and all the ministers on the pulpits
Ushers, deacons and my lovely choir
They sound so beautiful, don't you agree?

Sing it sister yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this are and G
The Masterpiece such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

In the beginning as a child, I was chosen
Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball

As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin' the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers and gangbangin'

And dope dealin', cold feelin' to be a product of niggaz around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin'
I found myself grindin' on the streets quite often

With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs

Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin' up
Disrespectin' my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin'
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin'

Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light

I've grown, to comprehend the game my name is
Big Snoop Boss Dogg just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin' just what I practice

To each and all, I got a word from the beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you

I love, to give you light

And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked down
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha

I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
'Cause a lot of y'all think, y'all goin' to heaven, huh
And you ain't gon' go, so I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say neigh-bor, you ain't goin' you ain't goin'

I'm just here to help you step your game up

You look like a dime right from here
You can dive in half of the bullet and die for me
'cause you can fly, you be fly, you can fly with me
And when I fly another country, you can fly with me

An' it's low key, guess who where tha crown

But nope I'ma baller 'cause, never gon fall in love
Pshyche that's a damn lie
Ladies put ya hands high every woman should get that one man to stand by
It's called devotion, emotions could make a man cry
But ma wipe ya tears and just stare in that man eyes
Prove that you there for him, prove that you care for him
That's how you gotta act, prove that you got his back
Prove that you not a rat
Don't creep and ho around, hold him down
'Cause you know what comes around goes around
And I'm older now and it might seem kinda weird
But man all them damn AIDS commercials got me kinda scared

Yeah girl you heaven sent
I love the way you break and take all the evidence
Pimpin cause I'm stayin in your mothafucking residence
While you out bringin me back the dead presidents

Kissin' and huggin' me
Lickin' and rubbin' me, it'll get ugly

Pop bub' the hot tub gettin all bubbley
You don't even gotta ask, all my girls got it bad
Closet full of Prada bags and I ain't even gotta brag
Yeah I keep them lookin real
Go 'head you can push the wheel
And if ya face tough I might wake up and cook a meal
Whatever you ask for (It's yours)

Fish swimmin 'round, the moonlight shimmer down

Her partner got 'em laced, cut right below the waist
You can tell they got taste by they ensemble
One like to salsa, the other the mambo
Why settle for one when I can have the combo?
Why do Cancun when I can go to Cabo?
They like to work out, and I ain't talking Tae-Bo
They like fast cars, I ain't talking Volvos
They both are the devil but they like it diablo

I didn't even have to say it, baby want to stop and play it
Rewind that, pop and grind that
You'll find that, a woman like yourself can't keep cumin by yourself
Get in where you fit in, now enjoy yourself
Cute bright skin brown skin take me to the mountain
Get you wet like a fountain
Then get your counseling, have a seat have a drink have a toke
It's a ""Doggy Dogg World"", you can have whatever you want
Or whatever you need, all you got to do it follow my lead

And see classic tits at classic bars

Magic stick ill break down walls
Got my heat as shit jumps off
Really you stepping to me is a lost cause
Party animal here since a quarter to ten

Nephew, boy this s*** is out of control
Rockin', rollin', bangin', B	
A little something, something n****; that's banged up streets
Freak, freak y'all, into the beat y'all
And to all my big doggs: grab your meat ch'all
And yes, yes y'all, oh, we the best y'all
We got the s*** that make the b****es grab they breast y'all
It don't stop till the wheels fall off
Nine fifty-four headed swervin' in the goodin' clinic, tryin' keep it hot right
F***ers spot light, my n****, Jelly Roll, make it knock light

[Chorus]
We all shinin' stars
Y'all know who you are
And dip low lows with me
You party with a D.P.G.

We ridin', dippin', slippin', slidin', eastside up eastsiders
Riders, ballers, rollers, ladies
Players, gangstas, macks, pimps, and 'llacs
Hustlers, b****es, n****s, and G's; we having big thangs blowing trees
Shinin', grinin', refuse to lose
I gotta a G in my pocket for dippin' out of shoes
I head the corner in the Navigator
Committed to excellence like a Raider
You hate a n**** like me, but you got to love me
Your lady want to shove me, and your kids want to hug me
A n****, f***in', like Buggsy Seagal again; I'm in the ringle again
I do it all legal again; I can't lose; you won't win; respect the boss
If you run up, you gettin' done up; I love to floss

[Chorus]

Why you acting bad?  Probably 'cause I'm know as the bad actor
In the rap game, I'm the big factor, macker; smack a b**** in a second
The big dogg n****, very well respected
You gotta put your mash down when you want to get to the top
The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop
I thought I told ya, n****, I'm a soldier
No Limit lieutenant; yeah, I did it
I'm committed like a motherf***er supposed to be
Won't let no b**** n****z close to me
From my head to my feet, I'm protected from harm
'Cause I'm a muthaf***ing shining star; you feel me?
And f*** who want to kill me
You n****z thrill me, but guess what will be
On top tip top, non-stop, dogg not
And you gotta let me end; the n****, I'm a shine like a G

Don't wanna fuck with me
Dogg Pound Gangstas
We do it like that
Motherfuckers out there be like, takin our styles
Be trying to do they own little dissing
But they can't do it, you know
So we gonna, do it like this
Sit back relax and get a cool one

Have you ever heard of a slaughter, I oughta start dippin
Sippin on that S-T get's me to trippin
I don't slips I bangs
With that mad ass Dogg Pound Gang it's a DPG thang
Kurupt from the S.C
You wanna test me let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental
I subdue, and then take two to your temple
When I cause holocoust from what's spittin
Niggas collapse and when the straps is clickin
Look, this is how it's done nigga, one two three
I grab my strap you best run nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick

Shit, a motherfucker better recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone ever since I was born
Not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin styles minute after minute
But soon as you did it I smelled the niggas shitted


Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay
Every single day in the LBC
Cruising through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style
When I back up a green six-fo' busting freestyles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck with my crew

I see all these niggas trying to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then to say the least
I see a few trick ass niggas layin low on the East Coast
And the question is asked
Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down with him
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killer
In a Steeler hat motherfucker cuz it's like that

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference, cuz it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, cuz niggas talk shit

Now if, a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowing in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
Cause it messes up the flow, to the real fillings y'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy
Then away like a stray dog
Tryin to claim every bitch as his own
Cock-blockers, come in every color
Even blue, now this is true
Trying to fuck your woman, and even you
Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker",What Would U Do?,2004

If you ain't down for the ones that suffer in South Africa
From apartheid and shit. Damn it you need to
Step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in
And start putting some funk in that ass

Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

They wonder where me bailing and don't really understand
The reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against them
Them never ever love me cause it's sport to break the,
And kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest

Yes we have. There have been riots, rioting, well I don't wanna say
Rioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want
To show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

What they told us today, in other words,
You're still a slave. No matter how
Much money you got, you still ain't shit

Sitting in my living room calm and collected
Feeling that gotta get mine perspective
'Cause I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row, is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthing lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love them so they can't love me)
Yo straight putting down getting my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or something
Got a VCR
In the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

There has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd
Throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well. Like there was a young woman there.
You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
187 time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away
Or get prints so my Uzi witta spray
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like Pop, pop, fizz.
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo
Creeping with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up, filling the clip up, I zip up-
Town, the motherfucking cops are all around
Helicopters flying
These motherfuckers trying
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no's the poor black refuse to go

This is now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these
Fires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south
End of South Central is a long way

Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something
Break em off something

The outcome of this is destruction so the more fall
Niggas don't give a fuck so them bust and before
Niggas backing up three black shows
No justice so they copied ya right
And here I am again, me, turn the other cheek, me
Be too many wigs got me 9 to my tights
So me bust, flick cause he don't give a fuck
And me don't give a fucking of my problems
In with their fuck fuck

Blak blam, blam to them fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye

Why you motherfucking brothers' hard to find

Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I thinks it's better to be retelling the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
Goddamn! 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for trying to prove
To their homies that they can hang by dealing with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax and back, do a job and jet

'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat

That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat will make any nigga civilized
Old buster ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks em off properly
Real G so doubt it
I'm the one who's doing it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die

Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies

Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke

Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if your bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down

This is a simple case of an anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper
That mighta got you a couple of numbers when you were younger
But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper
Be a gentleman& try to be gentle man
The essence of stimulation mental man
But if your acting like you just got out the kennel man
Put your foot on the pedal & pump

[CHORUS - SNOOP DOGG]

If your girl's in ya face & she's outta place
What you need to tell her is... PUMP YA BRAKES
If you're out with your girls & he's pressin' you hard
What you need to tell him is...PUMP YA BRAKES
Now if you're underage & you're actin' all grown
What you need to do is PUMP YA BRAKES
If you're offended by this record, then you know that's you
What you need to do is...PUMP YA BRAKES
Outside the restaurant Girl sees Boy, Girl likes Boy
Girl meets Boy, Boy doesn't know that Girl thinks he's fly
Boy's a nice guy, so Boy says 'Hi'
Boy's Girlfriend returns from going to park
She sees them together this ignites a spark
Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark
Now this is where the pumpin' of the brakes should start
Girlfriend thinks that something's going on
Girl tells Girlfriend nothings going on
Boy's in the middle of the commotion beginning
Girlfriend's mad cause Boy keeps grinning
Now, why is he grinning but that's beside the point
Girlfriend should chill before they roll up in the joint
Jumping to conclusions gets you no where honey
Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy
Dummy

[SNOOP DOGG VERSE:]
Rule number one, is just like number two the who do's and what nots & what you should dizz-oo
No loud talking, no back talking, If you do either, believe it, you're
back walking
I hate to sound rude but then again, I have to
My rap thang and my mack game, It'll smack you , click clack you, spit at you
I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I got to
I got a question to ask you, would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let em
smash you
If I was you & you was I, would you keep it G or would you stay fly
If you was rich in a ditch, living low, would you push the button,
Keep it cuttin' or would you just let it go
Calm down little homey & know what your dealing with before you run up on me

Snoop Dogg,"Black people don't have nowhere to go 
You know  all we got to do is kick it 
We gonna kick it in our hood  you know 
What we gonna do we might 

We might go kill a couple of niggaz mane 
You know  go in they hood and do a drive by 
Then come back in the hood and laugh about that stuff 
You know it's just a thing 

Only how you really gonna get deep into it 
Is when one of your homeys die 
Just like when my partnaz died 
(we got some problems) 

[Chorus] 
First we pray, then we ride 
First we pray, then we ride 

He was my brother 
Loved him like no other 
To top it off 
I introduced him to this game 
I knew his mother 
Loved her like my mother 
Part of me is gone 
Bout take my brother home 

(what're ya gonna do) 
When the trials come 
(are ya gonna run?) 
Are you gonna run? 
(what're ya gonna do) 
First I'm gonna pray 
(are ya gonna run?) 
You muthafuckin right 

[Chorus] 

I ain't got nuthin but love for you loccs and hogs 
And I ain't got nuthin but love for my muthafuckin dogs 
In the mist of the war zone, its on on site 
Daylight tonight the heat held close and tight 

Beware here I come with the DPG on my chest 
Heat gonna spit like Elliot Ness 
In the darkest zone you feel alone and on your own 
And after I bust, niggaz call me Kurupt Coleone 

All I'm about is money, loot and cash 
Homeys in the DPG Nate, Snoop and Daz 
Now with these emotions how you approach yourself 
Knowin you all about your wealth and as it is to health 

First I pray, get my thoughts intact 
Ask for forgiveness 'cause I'm bout to lay this nigga flat 
Can you adapt, can you feel me, I doubt it 
'Cause the closest you see it, is when niggaz write about it 

I can't live without it and it ain't shit I could do 
But stay down with the homeys in grey and blue 
So just keep the heat close in hand 
'Cause I done see niggaz get shit while they homeboys ran 

Heavenly father shine your light on me 
I know I promise to slow down on this weed 
Seems I remember someone used to say 
One life gets taken, if you take one life away 

(what're ya gonna do) 
When the trials come 
(are ya gonna run?) 
Are you gonna run? 
(what're ya gonna do?) 
First I'm gonna pray 
(are ya gonna run?) 
You muthafuckin' right

Pull up the club 'cause it's Friday
Let's drink and hit the dance floor

Big chips at the bar spending
GT with the wheels spinning
Let's get somewhere and get high
For the rest of the night

Oh take with a thug baby and if you want it (if you want it)

With a quickness move fast
Better yet move quicker
Then get my a 40 ounce from Kenwood liquor 
Slide by Millennium park

I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time
And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a player, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness what's happening
That's about the time I put down the rocks

Best kept secret so I'm want up

Never looking back uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, cause see I'm blessed

Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in
They say Dogg you walk it too much
And you may think I'm talkin' too much
But then again I reminisce
I miss that hug, I miss that kiss
I miss that love
Really cause, I miss that bitch

And I love it when you hit that switch
Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the fuck did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit
That's right, had a nigga feelin' so good
That when I had went home
I was thinkin' 'bout you so hard
that I couldn't help but to pick up the phone

And I just had to call ya
I'm lovin' how you look and how you smell
And you got a ass fat as hell
I just had to call ya
Girl I'm lovin' what you do to me
You break me off and then put me to sleep

I woke up around ten o'clock this morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Put on my French-lace panties and my Enyce warm-up
I said, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the baddest bitch of them all?""
There was a quick pause
Then the mirror responded, ""You know you got it locked stop actin' retarded.""
Fa sho, that's why these bitches don't want beef
Cause I, flash the Roley with the all yellow deese
Got the sunflower-yellow on the fingernails
And the yellow Louie bag with the pastels
Yo I'm livin' like a model while my rap sales (Why?)
Cause niggaz love the way my back swells
Plus I show my ladies how to mack males
Fuck posin' for BlackTail, I'm bout to sign a PlayBoy deal, unh

Don't be amazed cause of me,
Be amazed cause the v came with a five year opped out lease (yea) 
That's cause I paid what I paid if you
Paid like I'm paid den yo cribs came wit the maids 
And if it didn't den you slipping catch up but by the time you do I'll probably do it different. 
I'm advanced the the pants see the kicks see the stones on the risk u see the phone on my hip? (where it at?) it's right there up to date please see clear
Its no blur yes sir.

[Chorus: x2]

[Snoop]
Shooting niggas down, slapping bitches up, straight cash strut with some heny in my cup. 
Rude for the hell of it, I should be the president hey yo homey
Doggy dogg got the medicine (where, where?) in the cabinet, 
I'm the magnet, of attracting the badest bitches on the planet dig it. 
I once was a pup never scared to run up I did it till the day I came up and stars do shine, 
I take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind first I, 
Chop um and den some, flop um den flip um, break um and bend um, 
Den fix um convince them to buy my records 
Cause you know its all hits spread the word cause you know its the shit! Quit
Playing go get it quit hesitating its the young and the big on the real my nig.

And duck muh'fucker 'fore I buck mine

I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin' that spinach

See you on the freeway, sorry baby

Catch me slippin', empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice
Ain't no slippin' when you thug for life, motherfucker can you see?

Never bow down, let these other bitches crawl

Ain't no half steppin' here, from the cradle to the grave

Now my pockets gettin' empty, and I'm panicked in a fright
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin' tonight
Ain't nobody livin' safe, got a plot, and I'm stressin'
All I want, is my muh'fuckin' money, ain't no question
Don't try to stall little trick, cause we hit
So bring in the scissors and get to clippin' at his dick

That's why I stay drunk, and I constantly smoke
My memories as a youngsta, hangin' with the homies
But now I'm doin' bad and them bitches don't know me (Who? Who?)
But playa haters can't fade me (Why?)
Cause this is thug life nigga and we're crazy, tell me do you see?

Yeah, constantly runnin' from danger
Ain't no stranger to cop cars
Gettin' arrested and tested wearin' a vest and don't drop my guards
My life is hectic, my homies send mail from jail
Niggaz in Hell got some horrible stories to tell
I'm catchin' cases and still tryin' to stack a grip
The IRS is tryin' to stress off a niggaz shit
A young nigga never had a prayer to prevail
And all my peers doin' years locked up in jail
What can I do, stay strapped, get a bigger crew
And creep around with them Dogg Pound niggaz too
And now we rich ain't no bitch than can touch us
And it's a trip, how we clown, when we fuck sluts
Bust nuts then I cut, that's my new thang
And motherfuckers got on do-rags

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Can I get paid, can I get paid, can I motherfuckin' get paid
Nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin' day and
Still never see a piece of it, you understand me?
It's not about the nice guy
It's 'bout the hardworkin' motherfuckin' Thug nigga
If you ain't a thug nigga, you ain't really doin' nothin'	
You ain't really makin' nothin'
These motherfuckin' po-po's and these pink folks
Got it all locked up for us to fail
See how they did O.J., and they doin' niggaz like that all day
So if you don't watch your motherfuckin' stack
Believe me, this could be your last breath...

Snoop Dogg,"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
Since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew

What you want on Nate Dogg
Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
'Ain't No Fun', now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it

He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess

Talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits

And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin
Be comin round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be beggin please
Dyin for the day to eat these

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that

I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside

Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker

But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

I got another homie from tha L-be	-see
Known ta why'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass trasform wit finesse
... and all that mess

I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted

Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip

Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is havin papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store

Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussin

The vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk bout me now

Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound

I saw a crew on 2-1 street
And said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
No, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset

I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-see straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music

They acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
'We used to see Daz, back in the day'
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed

so on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak, now everybody
peeping out they windows when they hear me beating up the streets

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass

This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow

I don't love them tricks (Why?)

Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue

But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood

Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if yo bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn

Sippin' on Gin & Juice, fill up your cups nigga

So bitch get on your knees and give me head like it's '94
And don't come up for air 'til the beat drop
I'm the Doctor's Advocate
Call it a sneak peak at the motherfucking ""Detox""
Take note, grab a pen
And let the world know the West is ridin' again
I graduated from Dre school, top of my class
Treat my switches like my bitches, got 'em droppin' that ass
Still bangin' The Chronic like Doggystyle came with it
And I roll up sticky on my bitch back while I hit it
I done Been There, Done That, had beefs and won that
5 million records on one plaque, I hung that
Still got Dr. Dre lowridin' in the '6-4
When you see us throw it up for the fucking

My lil' hoodrat, baby got that mini mac
Baby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that
Whatever you send us my nucca, we gon' send it back
I'm in the club with the snub gettin' love
With 20,000 Crips and 20,000 Bloods and
We don't give a fuck about none of y'all
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Bigg Dogg
I done seen niggas hit L.A. and get they chain snatched
Then they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back
What I look like, the motherfuckin' police?
There's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley bitch

With the red rag niggas on the West Coast (Fuck you mean?)

Violence breeds enemies, more permanent silence
California alliance, it's more important than ever
So throw it up, we lowridin' together (yeah!)

Uh, light somethin',
Stop frontin'
How much money's enough, think maybe like a trillion' figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like them Hilton sisters,

That'd kill me yo, filthy rich, my daughter pass it onto the next generation,
Throwin' carnations
At my tombstone,
In my new home,

Meet mom's in my east st. laurent suit on,
Then we do a dance like my man
Luther dan,
But my verse came first,

I stole change out her purse,
Now I wanna dig her up outta the earth,
Two more but lean forward, toward a new paragraph,
Blue carrots, D-class,

Strictly that Kush in the weed bags,
Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie (?) had,
Put in production,
Studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin,

Hit a spliff through a seance,
And I, play on playa

[Chorus]
Finest females, I spit game on, I spray tha, gotta' get your papes on, playa on playa,
Before it's all gone, sip don, tip weight up, do y'all thing when I swing, baby,
Spend dub's on yeh rugs(?), gotta' live crazy,
Finest females, I spit game on, I spray tha, get your papes on,
Playa on playa, get your papes on, play on playa, get your papes on..uh

[Nas - Verse 2]
Ruby red grapefruit juice
With grey goose,
Rubies in the Jesus
Piece,

Pimped out like Snoopy,
But a East Coast thing,
My girl's stocking,
Tied up in a knot top a' my beanhead,

Billion dollar dream head,
Went from triple beams to digitals,
Servin' fiends to minimal,
Sixty g's no criminal,

No mo',
Jus mo' doe,
My motions pouring,
Oprah's earrings,

On fingers while your girl performs cunning lingas,
Cause' there's big money a rumour lingers,
Barber cleans his blade,
Then they give me a fade,

Hot towel on the face,
Hot models who vommit after they eat so they can stay lightweight,
Swallowin' my protein like an ovaltine shake,
Come thru' like mo green from Godfather,

So clean where I step I 'Clorox it',
Keep twenty g's on both sides of the thighs,
That's four pockets, eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price,
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice,

That's the shit they stole from the Congo,
And other block soil,
True mack foil,
Nappy hair jus spinnin',

Hunny gave me a massage with the happy ending,
Finest females I jus came on,
And sprayed uh, gotta get yeh papes on, play on playa

It's kinda hard for a playa like you,
But let me show you how a nigga like me, get revenue,
What ya never do
Is punk out whatchu better do,

Never let the game get ahead of you,
Get a better view,
Better yet, a better clue,
Praise God, imma marry you,

Get your hoe to, carry you,
Bury you,
Slowly, roll me another blunt,
Stuff it,

Lick it,
Puff it,
Tuck it,
Fuck it,

That game,
That thang
It busts,

In D.O Double G we trust!
Yup, yup, young roll with the two steps,
He creepin' with tha two tec's,
They sleepin' with two chicks,

Right before we blast all you heard was two clicks,
End of existence,
For instance,
Rewind,

Replay it,
Re-chop it,
Remix it,
We twist it,

Goddamn D.O Double G, cuz we missed it,
Travel slow,
Im an indian, but not a navajo, I
Smoke the big leaf

End all the big beefs,
My hair in two braid's, im the big chief,

Snoop Dogg,"[Chorus]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars,
Success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce
Hollywood divorce

(And I'm a star!)
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. 
I'm so not sober.
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda.
You can call me a roller. (Hold up)
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different.
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know.
And did you know I'm the creator of the term?
I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long. 
They just making it burn.
Make a movie of our lifestyle,
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax 
Like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga
Cooler than anti-freeze 
Defrost on your window pane 
Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne
Don't make me nut
So that's why I got a pre-nup
(I do)

[Chorus]

(Yeah, Yeah)
A is for Adamsville
Be is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck 
If you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, 
I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your un-
Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest 
Three fourths of it all
(For what?) 
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? 
Get get get get get on your knees
Cause 'wealth' is the word (yep)
'Rich' is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? 
Shoot me a bird

Tenth grade 
The way was paved 
For me and Dre. to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein 
The arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin
Been jamming for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint 
Public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears 
And think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel 
All new cast
Just ain't the same 
Gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name 
Behind that screen name
They're lame 
And their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face 
Straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
(What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot?)
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk 
We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes 
Must be something bigger waiting

[Chorus]

(I do) 
Love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, 
It's game time
Do you take this here 
As your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her 
For all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share 
Take you there
And me and you together 
Baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time 
We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence (Is that right?)
But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce. 
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our game
Take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb 
That's a cold thing",Hollywood Divorce,2006

Before the RR had the hitchhike thumb

Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed 
Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up

Sayin' let's shit on the peons 
Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion 
Make em say 'wat we on??
U say no like u was doin it for eons 
Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons 
Wen it rains it pours 
I laughs to myself wen I change the score 
U said my sex was a lot but my brain gave u more 
And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy 
I guess he played games 
There's only diamond dice here 
Not tryin ta justify 
But wen ya shut ya eye u can touch the sky 
U in trouble ma 
And u should pray about speed

She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug 
Now it is wat it is and it was how it was 
I'm hollin lil mama like wat 
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back 
All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser 
Laid back while we sippin on a breeza 
Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza 
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza? 
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas 
Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!?

A nigga need a shot a that
And I know where they got it at
Damn girl you gotta lotta that
Why don't'cha let a real nigga goin' and handle that

Look at you girl, light brown, ass round
Feel like a nigga chasin' down a rebound
It's bouncin' like a basketball
If you got no ass at all
Sorry girl but you won't make the casting call
Skinny bitches need to find that nutritious
Shit that makes yo ass so thick and delicious
Is it the food or is it the water
That make your daughter show what momma taught her

Come here, let me whisper in your ear
Tell you all that bullshit that you want to hear
You'll probably hate my fuckin' guts in a year
But right about now, you like a niggas style, huh?
How I talk, how I smell, how I smile
How I faint, how I fuck, how I growl
Fuck with me, you get your meat and your vegetables
Fuck with him, you get a fuckin' metro sexual
You want a man stronger than you
Not a motherfucker in the mirror longer than you
Break a nail and his punk ass lookin' for glue
You want a nigga with a hard dick lookin' at you

[Chorus]

You came up there lookin' all cute and stuff
You and yo home girl, a pimp couldn't get enough
You talk that shit, like you wasn't up there just to fuck
But guess what, now bitch you with us
Yeah have a sip, go take a puff
Go and split another blunt, now roll it up
What's yo name, a nigga love how you came
You just in need of some game
And I got that good thing
Yeah it's a west side hood thing
Let you party all day and hit you with that ding-a-lang
I got that good shit lollipop
And once I get up in ya, I make that body rock
You's a thick little bad bitch, walk with a switch
All you need now is some gangsta dick
It's the Big Bowwizow, you know I'm on the prizow
Doggie Shizow to make your kitty cat meow
Big beak, freak-a-leak, fuck some sleep
And don't tell me that I'm in to deep
OK, alright,

Do yo thing girl, fuck what they lookin' at
Shake it for me mami, work that pussy cat
Do yo thing girl, fuck what they lookin' at
Shake it for me mami, work that pussy cat

But what do you know about Pac's life? (What you know about Pac's life?) yeah
Everybody talk about Pac's life (outlaw, outlaw, yeah)

Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill em'
Never figured that, that same nigga'd sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin cop cars look at how we come so far
Picture high school dropout rollin' the double r
House full of happiness weed and drink
Way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
Never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurt's to see the change
It comes with the fame
Why we gossip in the silly games
To all the motherfuckers speakin down on me -
This is the night, why is everybody caught up in Pac's life
To all ya'll niggas, conversatin' on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' business!

Everybody talk about Pac's life (outlaw, outlaw, yeah)

When we first hung out together, I met you with the homie
We had no intentions of becoming homies
But at no time at all, you became my dog
You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
I was living on wilshire in the penthouse suites
Had my lil' cousin daz hook you up with some beats
It was outlaw, dogg pound, death row records, man we tore up the town
Snoop dogg and dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam
Remember when I told suge to put you on the tizzeam
And you know that I was true
Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'all eyez on you'
And we became the most hunted together, '2 of amerikaz most wanted'
And our relationship was genuwine
Wanna know how I know about Pac's life? Cause was a friend of mine

Pac's life (yeah, uh huh)
Everybody talk about Pac's life (and you ain't even know the homie)
But what do you know about Pac's life? (What you know about Pac's life?) yeah
Everybody talk about Pac's life (outlaw, outlaw, yeah)

Ey, what's happenin Pac' yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got the speed
You taught me first -- fate nigga can't stop a g
And all that shit you went through meant alot to me
Watchin you lockin up with him, was a shame to see
You know crack in the business did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas, it's a lane to be
Talkin' loud outta pocket tryna bang wit' me
Well so I'm pullin' out my pocket, let it rain ya' see
Now they all in the court room, blamin' me
See we lived the same life and represent the same struggle
Power to the real nigga and death to the sucker
Money over bitches get to know em' before you love em'
Death before dishonor never talk to army trouble
Live by the same rules, so my wrist's tattooed
With the same sorta' dude, with the same short fuse

Snoop Dogg,"Yeah, ladies and gentleman
Broadcasting live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bouncing, come on

The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behind the mic like Walker Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keeping my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gonna  shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin the Wild West way, giving it up
Leaving the whole world stuck not giving a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennessey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lock down facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range
Going up and down my dick like the stock exchange

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a - potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Running your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Ravel your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lacking
whenever you hear them other niggaz rapping
Rocking chains, stadium, palladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop top tinted on twenties
Using rappers like crash test dummies
Stacking real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

What an event, we hardcore a 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
It be like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat
Restless no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grier
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Come back, bounce in the spot and slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessey, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now scream

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

So there you have it, D-P-G-see
X to the motherfucking Z
Mr. Exuberant, Extravagant, Extraordinary, Exciting, X-a-lotta
X-O with a little bit of Ecstasy
Xing your bitch-ass out if you trying to test the G
And what's the recipe? Excalibur weaponry
And we shoot exceptionally
That there is hot X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks

""Let's describe a certain female"" [Scratched]

[Chorus: Snoop]
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy

[Snoop Dogg]
It all goes back, to '85
When I start getting pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yes sir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her home girl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shining like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her home girl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-oh-6
She brought some new tricks, flipping them squirrels
And the pearls, and turning out the neighborhood little girls
And I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began making, breaking bitches taking
Whatever we want, see she want with the faking
It's real in the field, no mistaking
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listening to ""One Love""
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fucking her sister it's getting real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been looking at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'ma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfucking president y'all
He said, ""Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?""
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimping, out in D.C.
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growing left
And you's a young hoe with a lot of hoeing left
Always keep a hoe in check, blowing us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little hoe I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went ""Ah""
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was trying to hump, I was teaching them to suck dick
Always trying to go up in a hoe
Got caught trying to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm moving fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on something fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you goin' do, when they ask you
Is you goin' tell a lie, or you goin' keep it G
Or you goin' hold it all inside or you goin' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she goin' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you living with that hoe and y'all got fo' kids

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's getting, it's getting kind of heavy

Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs

What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

Now, I'm 'trolling the dove, sitting on swoll 
27 years old, off on parole, stroll 
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money 
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street 
Things done changed but it's alright 
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
But it ain't no thing to me 
Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G. 
The little homies from the hood wit grip 
are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip 
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do 
Didn't know we had a 22 
Straight sitting behind his back 
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps 
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands 
I didn't understand 
How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
I use to be the same way back 
I guess that's what I get (for what) 
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread 

Lil' ghetto boy 
Playing in the ghetto streets 
What'cha gonna do when you grow up 
And have to face responsibility 

Something for the real OG's to get wit 
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play 
Like every single day, really doe 
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie 
No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
And learning just enough to keep your sack right 
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
Seven young G's put they serve down 
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now 
Not thinking about what's really going on 
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me 
But now I'm back at the pound 
And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
So make all them ends you can make 
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

It's too much; I serve too many people
And when I finish servin', ain't gon' be no sequel

Check this out baby girl
There's a few things I wanna explain to you, ya know
Now if you gon' be with me we gotta vibe together
Now that word means a whole lot to me
Now what I mean by that, it's simple as this
You gotta open up your head
Matter of fact, open up your mind
And let me put my head inside of your head
So you can think like me
And move like me and vibe like me
You know what I'm talkin' bout?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
You can smoke, you can roll
You can move, you can groove
You can drink, you can ride
You can vibe with a pimp
You can bounce, you can tip
You can slip, you can ride
You can shake, you can slide
You can vibe with a pimp

[Kurupt]
You can vibe with a pimp, ride with a pimp
Dip when I dip, come by my crib
Post with a playa, let me show you what it is
I don't really want too much mama, just a little bit
I came to give you want you want mama, wait a little bit
Got this place I gotta get to, I'ma tell you what it is
You can roll, you can post, we can ride up on the coast
Just post with your folks, just vibe with a pimp
See what I see, she said I'm G'd up, I said I'm guilty
Now run up in the spot girl and throw on somethin' silky
Bad to the bone, pure redbone
Vibe with a playa, and show me what you're made of
Ridin' with the all chrome D's on the Brougham
Out to get the paper, sparklin' like my Dana's
Wide with the all gold hundred-spokes on
G'd as I wanna be, can't you see what I see?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
You can smoke, you can roll

C'mon and ride with a gangsta mack
Pimp, dip, slide with this
C'mon Snoop git, blaze that shit
We got these hoes mesmerized
Hypnotized, blowin' they mind
A real nigga like this hard to find
Fuck a smile, give me some money bitch, give it to daddy
In a 645 to a '7-trey Caddy
Got 'em ringin' my phone, they won't leave me alone
Stand on it just like a rock, I'll break 'em hard as a stone
Conversation, illustration, plus a whole lot of patience
I'll have yo' bitch ass sittin' at the bus station
It's pimpin', my money hold me down, I ain't limpin'
Everything I got is on these motherfuckin' bitches
I can gorilla and smooth mack her, dick will slap her
Professionalism, bitch this ain't no actor
Realer than real, it's hard in the field
You got to have skills to pay a pimp's bills

Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that

A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast

Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine

Holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it
Something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home
Work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown
Put that shit on Daddy long

Move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me
Work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it

Bring 'em too
Come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it
We can get this after party
Poppin' everybody
Got themselves another body
Knockin' out
Without protection though
That's my confession
But at the spot
If you just think
Your gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot
Hold up
I came to cool out
Lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin
A couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it
But now it's known
That this cash shit

Some people have styles of their owm
Some people are copycats

You can't copy me, I'm one in a million
Call any expert and you can ask him
Copy machines can't copy platinum

No one can do it better like this 2 man crew
They say we're one hit quitters
So what cha'll gonna do?

Always into somethin', that's my name
Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who has the most is he who won the match

Strike one
Me and Nate Dogg is a match
Stike two
Leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three
You can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

Do you remember back on the east side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you think you really wanna step to me
Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me

Wow, make you say go now
Hot rap singles on the charts now
Got a baby
So I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now

You can't keep me out once you crack the door

Imus got it from the rhymers now if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty four now if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders now if that ain't strong

And we in it for the money, in it for the money
Hey, cheese

I wake up every morning gotta get it 'cause
I'm addicted to money 'cause, see, money is like a drug
It's the root of all evil, my people told me what it does
If you stick to it, get to it, do it now, live it up

Been in the hood since Job Noby stopped me
Talkin' 'bout what they heard how they got me
Man, listen, look, I came in the game
With the same dudes now throwin' dirt on my name

But it ain't nothin' to a girl like me
Love me or hate me I'ma still do me
And I've been through the ups and the downs
And no matter what they say, look, the girl's still around

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

Don't get it twisted and don't even try to knock me
'Cause I ain't one to ever be cocky
Man, listen, look, I came in the game
Broke and naive but a lot of shit changed

Yes, I've learned how to play it, I can show and prove
And if you ain't makin' money you ain't makin' moves
Yes, I have been through the ups and the downs
Wait, you're gettin' phased 'cause I'm goin' all rounds

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny

Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

Up to the ceiling, I'm feelin' like a million away from two billion
And I ain't stopped dealin', but am still in the game, still hearin' my name
Half a million dollar car, quarter million dollar chain
Money, and I'll tell you tonight
Money changes your life from a butter to a steak knife

Used to take life for granted
Now am known as one of the richest rappers
In the whole motherfuckin' planet
Ya dig it, I'm in it for the money

I make it rain, I let it snow
That twenty plus seven more zeros
Add it up, ya livin' wrong, better get right
Stop being broke and get ya monies tight

I'm only in it for the money
This whole industry is funny
They got me turning off the radio
Don't watch no videos, I can't get with it, no

For the money, I'm in it for the money
Ain't no joke, I know you're tired bein' broke
It's for the money, it's only for the money
Never see me smilin', any things damn funny

It's for the money, it's only for the money
He wants the fame and she wants the honey, yeah
It's for the money, it's only for the money
Me and Lumidee, shit, we in it for the money, no

I'm only in it for the money

Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

Drankin' yet I'm thinking of another rhyme
Smokin', hoping that some bad news will come some other time
'Cause I'm trying to do what I've loved, I love what I do
This music is something more different than the weed and the brew

That's why we mashin', we ain't asking for nothing, we working for it
Push it, peddled it to the people, they can't ignore it, this is for
All the independents, a few major labels
The big studios who still give niggas favors

On the mixin' and mastering, puzzlin' and
Plastering the tracks together on tapes, C-D's, wax or whatever
This is for all the engineers who smoke weed
Can't forget about the production cost and all the hidden fees

For another rhyme written, we spend time spittin' in the booth
Sometimes it's like a pigeon coop
But it's all for the cause, yeah, so I'm

As easy as it looks to you, I make it look so easy
With the music I'd be making big impression I'd be leaving
And a lot of folks, they stop and stare thinking I'ma trickin' off
I roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off

Move on to the next phase and it's amazing
The next generation of rappers, big Snoop Dogg raising
Hmm, that's 15 years in the game
Still got the fortune and fame, yeah, I'm doing my thang

Stay open like 7/11 that's 24/7, when you need some hot shit
Stop by and get you a beverage, I'm servin'

Singin' folk songs but not no kumbaya, my Lord
You download it for free, we get charged back for it

I know you're saying, they won't know they won't miss it
Besides, I ain't a thief, they won't pay me a visit
So if I come to your job, take your corn on the cob
And take a couple kernels off it, that would be alright with you

Hell no, yeah, exactamundo
But we just keep recording and it ain't to get no condo
And candy, Bentley, Fanny with no panties in Miami
And that cute lil' chick named Tammy that you took to the Grammys

See we do it for that boy that graduated
That looked you in your eyes real tough and said 'preciate it
And that he wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for your CD number 9
And he's standing with his baby momma Kiki and she cryin'

Talkin' 'bout that they used to get high to me in high school
And they used to make love to me in college
Then they told me 'bout their first date listenin' to my tunes
And how he liked her finger nail polish

I say, hate to cut you off but I gotta go
I wish you could tell me mo' but I'm off to the studio, gotta write tonight

We gotta always look out for baby momma nagging

Oh for sure, check me out
It's still Dre Day, A.K. nigga
Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga my last album was ""The Chronic""
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on pace

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E [Repeat 2x]

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire till you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematic
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
(Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gonna get mine regardless

Right back up in ya muthfuckin ass

Add that shit up, D-R-E right back on top of thangs

And you say I never make records for you no more
Well this record is from me to you, baby
Yeah, real talk

Been around the world
I've been into many places
Seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby, none of them compare to you
Soon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone

I seen everything twice
Been around the world, I've seen every scene twice
Stopping down in Tokyo, dipping in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every colored dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Rich and infamous with the blue and grey Pumas
Gangstas don't die, they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my candy
I'm sorta like Sammy
Smoother than Marvin, I need me a Tammy
Sippin' Chardinae, making deals with my hands free
Fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me
Cause I own rap, and I'm coming for your day job
Until then, I'm chilling at the day spa
Relax my mind and just chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby, you know I

What you do, just start balling? I been around the track
Hop in Peas with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office
Docking down in Manico, churching with my folks
Bad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat
My life is like a movie
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby you know I

[Outro]
Just for you baby
Yeah, I'm on my way home right now
I'm on my way right now

Snoop Dogg,"[Chorus]
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammy's
But these streets won't say a goodbye

I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)

I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye

Goodbye

I can't say goodbye goodbye

Goodbye

I can't say goodbye

Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies

[Verse 1]
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,
Let them do them take care of your own boy""
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me, 
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot, man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live... In the streets

[Chorus]

I just can't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye

They love it when I let down my hair
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel
So I let 'em all come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if they able
Bottles of everything, models and everything
Everything goes and yes I mean everything
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So, I invite her over to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now

So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled action!
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck
Huh, yeah, here we go again
I gotta go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm just too much commotion
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub

He slide me new hoes everywhere we go
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight
Yes, these Hollywood nights
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out

Get stuck in the ribs by old bone crusher
2 tone leather with a soul of a hustler
Try'na stack mail stealin' clothes from my brother
People wanna know am I close to my mother
I'm a premature baby I'm ahead of the others
Yes I'm aware of the gutter
Ahead of my time, the games gettin' smothered
I stay on the grind but its only gettin' rougher
Niggas think I'm playin' 'til they smokin' like a muffler
Bout to take flight the name open on u bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckers
Niggas keep symphin', they wanna be usher
Until they get they eyes n coffin closed by the usher
Them punches wont work you need more muster
Lord lay em down he need no sufferin'

[Chorus: x2]

Hmm... on my road to riches
I done seen a lot of roaches an' bitches
Thats why the dogg keep goin' the distance
But niggas don't know when to listen
Thats why I load ammunition n stay in touch wit my competition
I'm in touch wit my composition
Roll a blunt, its the kush
Yeah we got prescriptions
Just a g 5 no aggressions
Pick a side, yeah you know we crippin'
And through my eyes I see the world different
A hundred G's to record wit 'em
Hit the gas get me more engine
This is somethin' that was born in em
No game for a bitch jus' for fit em
I'm in tune gimme more rhythm
I let the bullets and the swords hit em
Aw please like a force emblem

I'm in the party low-key, blowin' an eighth of dro
I'm playful but I don't play
Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
In hell before I fail, I'm alright
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man
Brazil to Iceland
I shine like a million lights man

I don't need to shout it, you better read about it

I love it when you pop that bottle
I love it 'cause you're not so automatic
I love it when you put it where Dogg can grab it
I got my hands where you'll let me
I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery
I'm blessed with history
No less than best, catch the rest

Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press

Take me to the river 
And baptize my soul 
I'm so outta control 
Needing someone to hold 
Man it's cold 
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin' 
I'm focused 
Bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin' 

I'm trying to figure out a way 
But I just don't know how to say 
But I'm rearrangin' 
Hopefully I'm changin' 
And you can see that 
Baby 'cause it's hard for me 
Kinda sorta odd for me 
But ain't nothing to it 
If you need me to do it

I got this old school, the color of soul food
Candied Yam racing strips, pipes potato white
Cornbread interior trimmed in collard greens
Air freshener smell like chicken and pork and beans

I work the grave yard shift cause I'm dead on my feet ya'll
really want to quit but the kids got to eat ya'll
See money can't buy you power
but it can pay the water bill on time so them kids can take a shower
And I swear to GOD, if they keep on raising these gas prices
I'ma sell this Chevy and go buy me a bike
I'm a King, but my crown in a lay-way
And I'm just a day away from giving up.

[Chorus: x2]

Credit card company called said my bill is overdue
Told them I couldn't afford to pay them and rent too
They told me they were gonna sue me
I said if you didn't want me to use it then you shouldn't have gave it to me.
And what's up with these people blowing up buildings
And nothing really gangsta about blowing up children
Would cry, but my eyes in a lay way and I just a day away from giving up.

Bossy Boss, mink seats, what it cost
Speak yo peace, can't you see ain't no big deal

Close the door and don't drop crumbs on my flo'
Here we go, soul food, so cool, and i got this...

Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the president
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (bitch)
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the top dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.
Smash motherfuckers thinking they goin' smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the ""world's most dangerous group""  N.W.A.

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talking shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e
C-p-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick
Talking shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood

Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes

Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave

I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more

[Verse 1: E-40]
I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel
From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh
Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way, let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove
Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac
Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died
Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25
Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone
They say, ""40 Water, I just wanna be on""

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Game]
They say money makes the world go round
And since I'm worth twenty mil, I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a Schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get Cash Money like Baby do
I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do
So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Let me get a fifth of some brandy, a plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can't we all get along
Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon
Doggy Dogg keep the bone
One of a kind, blow you mind
Just like Einstein, born to shine
I'm getting mine prime time like 21
Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun
Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on
Cuz on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch
So much pain I overcame, same thing
Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand
I'm populating with my weeper's translation
That's my main man, let me hit that damn thing

Your party on E, if snoopy don't come
You smoke about a zone, I smoke about a drum
Burnt in the club, my hands on her thigh
A east side nigga put his hood in the sky
She like what I say, I like what she do
Turn that ass around and drop it like a fool

The homies all on, but I'm a get you

Lil Jon did it, the party goin 'dumb
Put it in the air, listen to the drum

Swishers all around, gettin' burnt up
Look at how I do, I grab her by the waist
Whisper in her ear, then I touch her on the face

Snoop Dogg,"Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway
Read over the dier
Reap while I stay
Getting Rich-ard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away
Cause I got priors
Its hard to stay rollin' when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire
Flyin' down sunset
Motivated to win
Like I ain't won yet
Take shit over
Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-C y'all bringin' that a G boy
Tonight its going down like free fall
Chevy bouncin' up and down like a fuckin' see saw
Trippin' off hate no hee haw
All blacks locs on the loc
Actin' like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to da mean dogg
When I bring it to you
You be like what you mean dog?
Then we go back and forth like its ping pong
Knowin' I should just ring ya bell ding dong
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxes
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors
I'm gone then you suddenly hip hoppin'
Shit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like an m n m
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin' Slim so Shady but ain't talking Eminem
So fuck you him and him
I was gang bangin' before a nigga entered in
No facade I went from the yard to a 3 car garage
To instant manaj's just vintage, relentless
I mean this I promise
No Suge, No Dre, Ida did this regardless
And that's what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucka', this crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin' 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swanging, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I wont be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Back flip back to plack shit
Blue red white to black shit
But for the green I send a whole motherfuckin' team to clack shit
React to mack shit
Problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit",2 Minute Warning,2009

Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool

See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug

But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up

More money, more time
I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine
So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine
I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes
So jealous, so envious
What a drag

Spend a hundred grand over by the bar like pimping ain't easy

Well it ain't

Make a little nigga faint
Balling is what I does
I ain't messing with you cant's
I'm a can do negro
A real life California hero
About six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account
Nigga ain't ya mad at me
I'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine
Yeah you see it fool
Snoop's everywhere, Italy I'm heavy there
Did a show in Rome like hoe say you ain't never there
Talking 'bout you popping bottles
I don't see none
You made it rain where?
I don't see a wand
Go on get it off
That's what they like to hear
It's your money pimp
We don't fight it here
It's hard enough to be me
Not trying to be you is something I got to see
Until then I'm a

This ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you
I been through some shit
I made it easy for ya
Now you ain't got to do much, I pop at everybody
Go unwrap a bottle, share it with them busybodies
Tell 'em what she want to hear
How you would like to take her out of town and shopping here
And Snoopy is your homie
Nah nah girl he out of here
Yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here
You a fool Jack
Though I don't condone faking for a bitch
Don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
Go ahead and talk money
Talk, look at the chicks it brought
But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for
I do this balling cause I can not cause it's cool
I pop cause I'm the man
Now watch me and Kells

[Chorus]

I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag
Pimping in my cup
Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'm a throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause that's how I does
Uncle Snoop say Kells go hard or go home
Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

Kiss me slowly,
Perform quiet storm til I get you nicely
I'm puttin' out the blunt cause I see
I see that I need you more in my life
Than I need a bag of weed.
Now I compare you to a bird
When she fly by
I wanna rock you back to sleep
Like beddy-bye-bye.
Bounce in the 'lac
With your hand on my leg
Throw your bags in the back
I'm a show you where it's at
No telling if we might come back

See I ain't never flown for fees

And you think that you gon find
Another G like me?

They gon' just hump
They ain't gon do it yo way
I can't hate and say what they gon' do
All I know is that I'm true
And know that you my baby boo
Let's take a chance, Go to France
On a 3 day cruse
Walk with your man in the sand like ooh,
It's our little rondez-vous
Whoopty-whoop
Big snoopy and ooh
I picture this love affair of ours
To last a lifetime just like flowers
Take a quic flick the get dressed
We'll head to Brazil,
I'll show you how it feel
When you're rollin' with the real
How it feel?

We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't go
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever, for life!

Now that we're living our life especially
I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible it's edible
My ice cream, have a lick
I catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need
Come be my number one, please?
See I ain't never blow no cheese
And done no songs like these
I love the air that you breathe

Where that nigga who be talkin' shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick while I was squeezin' the tits
Then I hit it from the back gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum but I was tryin' to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishin' on your raggedy brougham
Coulda thumped you and the dog you little fag
And don't sag too hard you show everybody your thong

Who you motherfuckers think the top Dogg bang with
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggaz grow they hair hope they stayin' act hard
That's even tho' yo' ceo talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Better known as criminals, thuggin' off on the stereo
Killin' 'em on the radio, some of them want to hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again

While, you get nothin', we keep gettin' more

Go on and do yo' thang, gang-bang

Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back
And had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayne

Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
and reason why niggaz with problems keep on steppin'

Nine to five, minimum wage, what type of life is that for me?
It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around

You had the audacity to want to tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin' tryin' to stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' ""treated like a prostitute""

Little mama clothes falling like the leaves in the fall
Ain't worry about your friends so bring 'em all

Everything I do, I do it big

What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything

Snoop Dogg,"Now here we go, y'all gotta play this
(Why?) 'cause the others are so scared to say this
Now tell me, what am I supposed to do
About a sucker like you who ain't never paid dues?
Slapper, hip-happer, you're gettin' wacker
Your girl better step, or I just might jack her
Smack her like a gangster, but I don't bang
I gank suckers like you for thick gold chains
(He don't deserve it) hell nah
So take it off your neck
'Cause goddamn, you ain't comin' correct
What's this, a sucker duck holdin' a mic?
And like keith sweat said, somethin' just ain't right
Seems nowadays everybody wanna be a rapper
Down wit' crews
But they ain't never paid dues
Suckers perpetratin', playin' hardcore
Punks, I bet you worked at a flower store
You know what eats me up the most?
Is when a sucker just started and thinks he's high post
You ain't pay a nann due in your life
Talkin' 'bout a new style, you know who you sound like?
Krs, chuck d, kool moe, as one
Yellin' on the mic like ya name was Run
You'se a peon, went and bought a pair of Lee's
Now all of a sudden you supposed to be an MC?
Yo, that's wack, it just ain't right
You only stood on one stage in your whole damn life
Now you want respect, hey yo, you'se a fool
Everybody wanna rap, but they ain't paid dues

I can still remember way, way back in the days
The times me and Aladdin dreamed of gettin' paid
Standin' outside just to pull in the jacks
To earn a little money to drop a dope track
Back in the days I drove a raggedy Dodge
Couldn't afford a studio, so we used a garage
Aladdin used to grab a gang of disco breaks
One turntable and a broken 808
My little brother tunes and frank, they hung around all night
To make sure that the demo was tight
Didn't have an enigneer, if you know what I mean
Aladdin did it all at the age of sixteen
Gifted, uplifted, straight gangsta mack
Suckers had me playin' the back
But thanks to Ice-T I got my foot in the door
Now I'ma rock the mutha-(uh) 'till it ain't no more
We paid dues

I knew a brother who used to dress just like a faggot
Real tight jeans, some boots and leather jackets
Homie as hell, he never came outside
'Cause every time I came around, he used to run and hide
Spoiled like a brat, had everything he wanted
And when he walked, he switched like a woman
Rode a pink bike, man, the sucker was soft
Had to be in before the street lights came on
Yo, just the other day I turned my radio on
The mack attack kicked on a brand new song
I didn't know what it was, I never heard it before
But the record was smooth and hardcore
I said to myself,hey yo, I gotta see this group
So I called up Aladdin and the rest of the crew
Grabbed the nine wit' the hollow point tip
Stepped in the party with a gangster limp
Took a look at the stage, and yo, whaddya know
The same old faggot from a long time ago
From real tight jeans and the go-go boots
He went to pendeltons and a khaki suit
Now tell me, ain't this a blip?
Somebody need to slap the perpetrator in the lip
Yesterday he was a mamma's boy, now he's rappin?
Foolin' the crowd because he got you all clappin'
And tappin', an example of what I'm tryin' to prove
A sucker like this who ain't never paid dues
So to those who wanna rap, I'm pertainin' to you
Before you pick up a mic, you gotta pay dues, word

Let the story be told
That's the way it is
You got to pay yo' dues

Low profile definitely in the buildin', ya dig?

From the beat of my heart, it was true
I had to have you
I don't know if it's real,

Dancin', glancing, takin' chances
I'm chillin' like feelin' like this is
The one that I'm gon' make my Mrs
We're high when we touch ? tough
We lie in the cut, I don't do much
Being wit you, being wit me
Seeing it through, faithfully
I'll wait for you if you wait for me, gracefully, patiently

So when you choosing you just, take your time 
Ele-vate your mind, good you're, gonna find

You might be stackin' money, mountain high 
So they're, gonna try, try to, catch your eye 
But all that glitters boy you, know ain't gold 
Some would, sell their soul, they're out, of control

Hair blowing in the wind
Distinctive of me is gangster bliss

This is what you're calling a cyst
Pass the morph quick
Memories missed
I made a lot of friends
A whole lot of money
Been down a couple times
But it never stopped my rhyming
In fact I got better
Clutching on Berettas, blowing their sticky 
Turn it to weather 
Award shows, endo, free load bodes 
This is how a player roll

And I will never be questioned
By some new young chump popping their tongue 
Snoopy D made the way for you to walk
O in to The Almighty
Without you it couldn't be done
You praise with the rise of the sun, you did
Hold close in my hands from my throne
And I never be crucified
Within my own zone
Here for a very good reason to show love
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug
From almost going down for murder in '93
To kids all over the city bowling the Snoop's league 

I changed, a lot smarter, I got a daughter
Two sons,  beautiful wife, for starters
I did it all Jack
Popping these P's even in the national cuisine overseas yeah
Don't judge me you only knew Snoopy
You never tried to know Calvin you tried to group me, yo
Like some loco I earned my respect
Yeah so much for the coast I should get a check
But all in all I did it B
Cool as a blind with a C
Loving my life as I push away the groupies
Snooping in a coup and you can call uncle Snoopy

Take your chances
Still from the L B C

I'm about to hit the ground

Sippin' yak while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a near try to violate
Never go down, stay rising like Andre
'Cause my corner back every thing the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err'y day, err'y night till I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin', try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net

And I ain't knockin' niggas hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in betweens
We either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin', bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I do it 'cause I feel it
Live it like I'm talkin'
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk it 
I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons
Breads in the bag, call it good marketin'
Life's a bitch but I don't caught again
That's what a word to the third letter

Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather
Vietnamese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I'm biting whomever
'Cause I didn't came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
'Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me whack tracks

I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings
Its feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down
He's checking my background
It's ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

Snoop Dogg,"(I was raised in the hood)
East side Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the Crips are much meaner
(We got ya, back, I was raised in the hood)
I'll never turn my back on the hood
(I was raised in the hood)
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can't take the hood up outta me, you dig

Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins
Yet I'm stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it every time, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh wee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin' in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city when I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I'm going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin' like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block
East up, what it do though
Now I ride two door, the Porsche looking mean have to up it too
Hella far from broke, the forty won't choke plus a niggas still elope
Only 'cause 

[Chorus]
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got ya back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got ya back

Raised by the monsters the criminals
The G's, it was prettier than niggas on the east
What you know 'bout that
Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss
I catch a nigga slippin' like moss
Ride with the realest , I've been on it since a young and 
It's 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitch I'm rollin'
And I ain't worried 'bout them niggas we patrolling the hood and the city

Rollin on that illy
Two millys, two Bugatti's, call 'em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, Homie I'm a vet
Lil' nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around,
I'm a rep, east up, what it do though
Hoes spillin' Nuvo, Doggy on his tip
I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the forty won't choke plus a niggas still elope
Only 'cause 

[Chorus]

Raised by them hustles them dealers on the block
It was prettier them niggas in the spot
What you know bout that? Perped up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it's turned out
The people talking the rumors
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin' perped out, blowin'
I'm strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets 'cause
Like I don't come from the W, I'm a beast bro
What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the forty won't choke plus a niggas still elope

Girlies try to kiss me slow I'm leaning like a sixty-four
This life I lead is incredible, these trees I breath are medical
Take a look in my eyes, hold on tight, enjoy the ride
If you don't feel good, then you're out of place

You are my good looking grown with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know you know that it's on
I can be your best friend, let me stick it in

And not just a tip, I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm too short, but I ain't got a small dick
Just ask around, I fucked a lot of whose in this town
I get down, I come long and white
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride
The sun's coming up we started at four
I switch so much game, it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates, like pimping, she appreciates
'Cause my women, understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You never get a chance to go out with me
If you were broke bitch then you're not a real freak

[Chorus]

You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And now one of my homies wanna fuck
And now she wanna fuck from the get go I figure this is how I gonna be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ride with me
Don't stop, fall hot, Hollywood hills back to too short's spot
You wanna roll let's get go, said yeah
I wanna see if I can make you wet
'Cause you need it let me beat it
Your little fat friend acting conceited
Sitting in the corner, leave it the bitch is  a loner, dancing giving me a boner

I pull a pole on now, me and you girl we need to roll on now
You sat here in the dead weight, I knew you just wanna put your head in 

[Chorus]

She wanna be my BFF, I'm on the time baby got no time left
See I'm a mathematician, you can add the babe
Extract your clothes, then divide your legs
Win it all, equals how you can moan in bed
She gave me the P, gave her the D instead
See you a hot mess with the booty and thang thang
Swinging in the club when you drinking that drink drink
Smoke in the air chilling all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too short ah, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See I just wanna hit it and stick it in
'Cause I don't wanna be your boyfriend
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
Touch it once, I wanna say it again

Snoop Dogg,"I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy, envy please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Kelly palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
'Cause the smoke's already in the air
I am looked up with two braids in my hair
All start with the kaki suit
I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the D-I-P
Back then my only wed was my E-Y-E
Use my P-Y-T and you're looking so fine
I am sorry baby girl but tonight

Out of this world, Cooper Black's on the comic
This is church music listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire
D-O, double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC4
West coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore
When's the last time you seen the G in the G4
Don't worry I'll wait
Time's ticking I'm tripping
I'm slipping, I'll wait
Into the zone where these hoes hold my dog bones
I dog whistle and they download my ring tone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine go and get your own
I put peace to rhymes get piece of mind
O-Z to die 'cause this weed is mine

[Chorus]

I hear niggas talking about what they rollin' up
Smell what I smoke 'fore the back open up
Good chance you can see me there, I'm smoking one
License to get a fundamental road of shit
Real nigger blowing weed for hours, rolled it up
If I am in a building it's hard not to notice it
Hitta Billy said, ""Dogg I got some hoes to fuck""
I am gonna fuck you with an ounce of that potent shit
Don't trip bitch we gonna all sip, blow the hoes dip
Let you have mine plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigger get high and let the hoes twist
Say you don't fuck with twist look how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like 'cause I'm rollin' enough paper 
They've be burning for hours
And if it's fire I am smocking the whole thing inside

[Chorus]

I got a roll for you
Do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me

I got a roll for you

Now I been hearin' a little of this and that 
About you havin' some kind of a panic attack 
Tell us, uh, is it true? 
And when you have one, what the fuck do you do? 

Well, I'll be sittin' there enjoyin' a coffee 
And then all of a sudden, I'm like get off me! 
Then I start chokin off pedestrians 
Until they give me my shot of calliphilestrian 
But that's all over now, it's old hat 
I'm a perfectly normal necrophiliac 
Just don't test me or pull strings, forget it 
I might grab your neck and do bad things with it! 

Well on that note, thank you J (Sure) 
For real, what's up with poppin one of those Soloquium pills? 
Take your ass backstage and relax (I'm straight) 
Snoop Dogg is comin' up next! 
Stay right here, we'll be right back! 

I like my chili hot. As a matter of fact I like my chili so God damn hot 
That you can cook a hog's ass in a spoonful. 
When a workin' man such as myself wants a little hot fixin, I reach for 
That bottle of momma's God Damn Hot Chili. 
Smooth tender chunks with chili beans filled with momma's hot bastard 
Bacon bits, and drizzled with just the right amount of thick savory sauce, 
Drippin' with noodle nuggets and Texas tough onions. 
Mm mm that's hot, God Damn Hot. 
Ask for it by name. 

Thanks fellas! Alright yo, we're back

So any MC that disagree with me 
Step up and watch your motherfuckin' ass meet defeat 

Snoop? (What?) Now you got platinum on your walls 
While other fools stare and, scratch their balls (What?) 
They want to be like you, they want to try to steal your flow 
Now (What up?) Yo, why is that so? 

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go 
Some bitch ass nigga tryin' to steal my flow 
But I don't pay em no attention 
Oh, should I mention? 
I'm all about the money and ridin' in cars with suspension 
Bouncin', bankin' up corners smokin' dough 
Smokin' that weed, hangin' out with my locs and folks 
Don't give a fuck about nothin' at all 
That's why I'm known to the world as big motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg 
Nigga

Battle that the habitat our men is deadly
You can get diluted 
Or depends on where your head be
Striving for what your in for
And for your info mo' flow
Than the tightest nigga flowed in Ninety-four
So, stand and deliver
Watch nigga's shiver
Quiver in they boots

Where the phonies get deleted
Be seated, and all the G's I know
Stay heated

Keep stunting just cause I can

King size papes stuffed full of trees,

Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga, cheese
Remember days homie, I ain't have a thing
Now I'm hoping off a plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money comes fast yours slow like ?
Rolling up grass, so weed to have to style, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' green smoke

We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high

Got a new batch, some blue, booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass, say dog he just smoke all day
It's a mind game, like the ream I seem to keep migraines

My grass day off day off like Ferris Bueller

You niggas still in junior high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holler at me when you graduate

If you are listen to what I am trying to tell you
Every dime pays but they catch ? messing with their ?

I ain’t tripping I am ? another one I got a couple of problems with my bitches

I am rolling ? police and don’t ask where I have been got ?
Haters talk when I leave they just ? when they see what they want and they need me
I am a fucking game genie young nigga but I make it look easy
It could be easy
Money too stay fly

It could be easy
It could be easy

Never the same game

The track is where I kick it

Like I roll weed baby start with now she need me
Believe me you complete me protect the spite

It could be easy
But small things make it so hard
It could be easy
Tell me what you really do

It’s been down before
It could be easy

Snoop Dogg,"Yea wassup baby girl
I'm just looking over this homework
I really need some help
You wanna study with me?
That'd be nice, yea

[Chorus]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated

[Chorus]

Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying to use it for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall

[Chorus]

Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

[Chorus]

Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at

Snoop Dogg,"[Chorus: x2]
Have a little party at my crib 
And all the weed is rolled that's how it is 
When you fucking with some OG niggas blowing OG smoke 
Don't even gotta ask, you already know, we 'bout to go 

Young nigga that's more famous than these older niggas 
Young nigga got my game up from these older niggas 
Motherfuckas hear my name, I say I told you nigga 
I was taught to count my paper 'fore I fold it nigga 
Now look at my chains, all them things frozen nigga 
Rolling up my Mary Jane before I smoke it wit ya 
Hit this J, I bet this be a day you don't remember 
Looking at the top and I don't see not one contender
Cooking out the pot, I like my weed for lunch and dinner 
Got some cookies in the jar, OG in the blender 
You paying for quantity, but quality is what you spend for 
If there's a marijuana-ology, I'll be your mentor 
And all about this chronic leaf is what in for 
So give your parents my apology for me again or 
Get high like we Cheech and Chong 
We gon' eat some brownies, we gon' smoke, we gon' need some bongs 
Roll up so we can all

[Chorus: x2]

Killer Cali is what we blow 
OG nigga from way down low 
Known for banging the blue C rag 
Started off smoking nothing but Zags 
Popping P's, chopping trees 
501's, all of these 
All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me 
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television 
Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga 
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be 
East Side Long Beach where I'm from 
Bring your girls, all y'all come 
Give me some, now give her some 
It's big Mac, I love to have fun 
You are, you are the one 
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1 
Break it down, lay it down 
Baby work that body like 
At the pad, acting bad 
Baby what that party like? 
Moving so schizophrenic 
Baby pull down your panties 
Let the Doggy Dog ram it 
I cram to undertsand it 
Back room that's my bedroom 
Make her right up in it 
Close the door, slow ?
I'm 'bout to slide up in it 
Smoke something 

[Chorus: x2]

Having money and blowing hella' chronic 
Smoke I'm stunting 
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running 
Sounding like a dinosaur if the stomach rumbling 
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming 
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner 
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb 
Stuffing kush ?, playing Megaman 3 
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami 
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family 
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing 
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston 
So why get caught up 
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up 
In sewing circles with them hoes 
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole 
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed 

[Chorus: x2]",OG,2011
Snoop Dogg,"Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas backin' me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain’t in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he’s the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real nigga gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon' get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I’m riding around town in the car that you can’t even pronounce
And you can’t go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I’m a player
So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My ballin' is actually

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on

Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don’t know
This is the shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don’t speak at all
You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly
If it’s good, it’s gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain’t the one
We don’t even smoke that shit for fun!

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on

Yea nigga, I’m rolling up that high-grade
Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it’s Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J’s a high day
Niggas think I’m Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a six into a twenty ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I’m high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let’s fuck!'
I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on",Smokin' On,2011
