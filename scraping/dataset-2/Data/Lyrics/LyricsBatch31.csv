Celebration,"Here our bodies burn diamonds.
I know. 
Into ocean tread.
Into fire bled.
Peeling back fur. It's gone.
I like to destroy myself.
I don't want to do you wrong.
Well, just go ahead and break my body down.
Let's drown, into the sea.
And this old heart of mine pumps down deep, and sweet.
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
"" Oh what's the use of draggin' you don?"" the jackals howl.

Oh babe, and if it's here we burn, won't the love return?
You'll never learn. 
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
Oh the pressure's great, the fates await, and they 
Oh sugar don't beg me now.
""Can we turn the coal?"" but diamonds is the goal.
Oh sugar don't beg me now.

Celebrity All Star Jam,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's none left
'Cause I've been brassing and laughing so long that
Even my mamma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talking, and where you walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta lope
As they croak I see myself in the pistal smoke fool
I'm the kinda G that little homies want to be like
On my knees in the night, saying prayers in the street light

They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

They got the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the strip
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loped out gangsta set trippin banger
And my homies is down so gonna rouse my anger fool
Death aint nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say
I'm twenty three never will I live to see 24
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.

They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cooking
They say I've got to learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck fool

They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

Celebrity All Star Jam,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

[Chorus]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Celebrity All Star Jam,"Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Could I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you

I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you

Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make me, make me

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You makin' me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do

Celebrity All Star Jam,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.

I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Cortándome el pelo una vez por mes
Y si me aplazó la formalidad
Es que nunca me gustó la sociedad

Y tuve muchos maestros de quien aprender
Pero sólo conocían su ciencia y el deber
Nadie se animó a decir una verdad

Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,1993
Celeste Prince,"Time has come, what's done is done
It's time to move on
To another place, another space, maybe circling some other sun
Don't ask why, don't ask how
I still can't explain
To say goodbye, goodbye for now till I see you again

In the sunlight that's where I'll be
In the moon night close your eyes, you will see me
In the sunrise in the twilight I'll be the morning and the evening star
I will be there with you wherever you are

Life is strange, such joy and pain
The betrayal and the kiss
It maybe meant to be, maybe destiny
Leads us down a path like this
Child is born, true love is sworn
All the in-between
Well you walk on, walk on until the path is gone
Learning love is the only everything

So it's goodnight, things go wrong
but it's alright
We're all just passin' through here
At the speed of light",Wherever You Are,2001

Celestial Image,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2003
Celestial Navigations,"I'm going home. 
It's time for me to go home.
Not to the farm with snow all around, 
The smells of food filling the house while we sit by the fire. 
Not to the mountains, where I can look across the valley to the jagged peaks, silent in the morning. Not to the seaside village, standing on the dock 
Watching a fishing boat sailing off in the misty morning.
I'm going to my home across the sky. 
Every night I stand here on the 
Earth and point to a star. 
On that star is a carriage, waiting outside the gates to the city. 
It arrives every day at three o'clock in the afternoon drawn by two horses. 
And when the sun goes down it leaves, empty.
This ritual has been going on for many, many, many years. That carriage waits for me. 
And on the day I arrive back on that star, 
I will climb into it and gallop away from the city across the blue hills to where the trees end. There, at the edge of time, is a cabin made of white wood facing the other side of the sky.
I'm going home.",Home,1995
Celestial Navigations,"If there were no words
no way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
no way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
untill the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

And the world will be as one

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Con luces que abiertas preguntan pa' qué

Que al soñar forjé tanta ilusión

Porque la vida me negó las esperanzas
Que en la cuna me cantó,
Pero ansia'o sólo alcancé un amor
Y cuando lo alcancé me traicionó

Lo encuentro en tus brazos

O un ave que inverna 

Cuando estoy contigo 
Yo cambio la gloria 
Por la dicha enorme 
De estar en tu historia

Celia Cruz,"Por si acaso no regreso
Yo me llevo tu bandera
Lamentando que mis ojos
Liberada no te vieran

Porque tuve que marcharme
Todos pueden comprender
Yo pensé que en cualquer momento
A tu suelo iba a volver

Pero el tiempo va pasando
Y tu sol sigue llorando
Las cadenas siguen atando
Pero yo sigo esperando y al cielo rezando

Y siempre me sentí dichosa
De haber nacido entre tus brazos y anunque
Ya no esté de mi corazón te dejo un pedazo
Por si acaso, por si acaso no regreso

Pronto llegará el momento
Que se borre el sufrimiento
Guardaremos los rencores, Dios mío
Y compartiremos todos, un mismo sentimiento

Aunque el tiempo haya pasado
Con orgullo y dignidad
Tu nombre lo he llevado, a todo mundo
Entero le he contado tu verdad

Pero, tierra ya no sufras
Corazón no te quebrantes
No hay mal que dure cien años
Ni mi cuerpo que aguante

Y nunca quize abandonarte
Te llevaba en cada paso y quedará mi amor
Para siempre como flor de un regazo
Por si acaso, por si acaso no regreso

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
Y si no vuelvo a mi tierra
Me muero de dolor

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
A esa tierra yo la adoro
Con todo el corazón

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
Tierra mía, tierra linda
Te quiero con amor

Si acaso no regreso
Me matará el dolor
Tanto tiempo sin verla
Me duele el corazón

Si acaso no regreso
Cuando me muera
Que en mi tumba
Pongan mi bandera

Si acaso no regreso
Y que me entierren
Con la música
De mi tierra querida

Si acaso no regreso
Si no regreso recuerden
Que la quise con mi vida

Si acaso no regreso
Ay, me muero de dolor
Me estoy muriendo ya

Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor

Ay, ya me está matando ese dolor
Me matará el dolor
Siempre te quise y te querré

Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor
Me matará el dolor

Uno busca lleno de esperanzas
El camino que los sueños
Prometieron a sus ansias

Sabe que la lucha es cruel y es mucha
Pero lucha y se desangra
Por la fe que lo empecina

Uno va arrastrándose entre espinas
Y en su afán de dar su amor
Sufre y se destroza, hasta entender
Que uno se ha quedao sin corazón

Precio de castigo que uno entrega
Por un beso que no llega
O un amor que lo engañó
Vacío ya de amar y de llorar tanta traición

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El corazón que di
Si yo pudiera, como ayer
Querer sin presentir

Es posible que a tus ojos
Que me gritan su cariño
Los cerrara con mis besos
Sin pensar que eran como esos
Otros ojos, los perversos
Los que hundieron mi vivir

Si yo tuviera el corazón
El mismo que perdí
Si olvidara a aquel que ayer
Lo destrozó y pudiera amarte
Me abrazaría a tu ilusión
Para llorar tu amor

Un, dos, tres
Tres gotas de agua bendita
Pa' que el muchacho de al lado
Te diga los Buenos dias

Tres gotas de agua bendita
Why se te aclara el puturo
Nuncia te falta el trabajo
Why vas hasta el fin del mundo

Con tres gotas de, de agua bendita
Para el dolor, para el dolor, para el dolor de cabeza
De agua bendita
Ay, mi abuela no vive
So no tiene el sabor
De agua bendita
Con tu paÃ±uelo en la mano
De agua bendita

Para que nada, para que nada
Para que nada, te falte de agua bendita

Ay, mi abuela, su ve el internet
Se cree que es de agua bendita
Agua bendita, agua bendita, que rica de agua bendita

Agua bendita pa' ti
Agua bebdita pa' mi
Why pa' mi abuelita
De agua bendita

Ese es mi abuela
La quiero con locura
Why a ti tambien, celia

Tres gotas de agua bendita

Translation:

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
With holy water
You can cure all your ills

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
And a few herbs will get rid of your nightmares

Three drops of holy water
And your whole future will clear up
You'll never be without work
And you'll travel to the ends of the earth

With the passing years
My grandmother would not understand
That the world progresses
And we have medicine, computers
And different countries
And not everything is solved
By soaking ourselves in holy water

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
For your headache
You don't need aspirin

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
And some herbs all take away your nightmares

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
So you don't have spasms
And never feel envy

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
So the boy next door
Will give you the time of day

Three drops of holy water
And your whole future will clear up
You'll never be without work
And you'll travel to the ends of the earth

(One, two, three,
Three drops of holy water)
For your headache
(Holy water)
My grandmother can't live without her
(Holy water)
With her hanky in her hand
(Holy water)

So you don't ever want for anything
(Holy water)
If my grandmother ever sees the internet
She'll think it's
(Holy water)
Holy water, delicious holy water

That's my grandmother
I'm crazy about her
And you too, Celia

Three drop of holy water

Uno no tiene la culpa
Caballo de la sabana
Porque está viejo y cansado

Cuando el amor llega así de esa manera

Uno no se da ni cuenta
Amor de compra y venta
Amor que es el pasado
Benberen benberen ben benberen
Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir así

Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir así
No te importa mi dolor
Te fuiste un día y me dejaste abandonada
Y fué la causa que mi corazón fallara
No es lo mismo que ayer, no es lo mismo que ayer

Ese amor que yo te dí
Por nadie más podría haberlo sentido
Y si regresas porque estás arrepentido
Olvídalo ya, olvídalo ya
Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir así
Bamboleo, bambolea

Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir así
Bamboleo, bambolea
Es que mi vida yo la prefiero vivir sin tí, vivir sin tí
Bamboleo, bambolea
Mi corazón se hizo trizas cuando me dejaste con tu sonrisa
Bamboleo, bambolea

Es que mi vida yo la prefiero vivir sin tí
Bamboleo, bambolea
Pero creo que cuando te fuiste, eso es lo mejor que hiciste
Bamboleo, bambolea
Amor que es de contrabando, empieza y termina ¿cuándo?

Bamboleo, bambolea
Te hice pasar buenos ratos y sólo recibí maltratos de tí
Bamboleo, bambolea
Voy a dejar el mundo que siga, y ya veré que hago con mi vida
Vivir sin tí",Bamboleo,2000

Que la vida lo trata mal
Tal vez ha entregado a medias lo
Grandioso de la amistad

Y que critica por criticar ya s hora que se

Despierten porque muy solos se quedaran
Y todo aquel que promete cosas para
Subir y para llegar no crea que engaña
A nadie que en su mentira el se hundirá

Viviendo de mal humor no se llega
A nada cambia la cara de amargao cambia esa cara

No creas que con dinero puedas compra
La felicidad hay gente que lo tiene
Todo y acaba solo en la soledad

Viviendo de mal humor no se llega
A nada cambia la cara de amargao cambia es la cara

Cambia esa cara de amargao
Cambia esa cara
Cambia esa cara para que luzcas
Cambia esa cara

Sacó partido de mí abusó

Yo no sé escribir poema ni tampoco una canción
Sin un tema de amor

El momento que mi amor se te entregó
Que mi amor se te entregó y usted abusó

Usted abusó
De mí cariño usted abusó
Sacó partido de mí abusó
Sacó provecho de mí, abusó

Y fue mi mal, me destruyó el desamor
Su gran escuela del dolor
Ya no sé si lo maldice o lo bendice el corazón

Cada palabra cada verso me recuerda
El momento que mi amor se te entregó
Cuando te entregué mi amor y usted abusó

Y fue mi mal por que jamás en mi creyó
Y usted sacó provecho de mi abusó
Y me perdona por quererle, tanto, tanto, tanto
Y por eso mismo usted sacó provecho de mi abusó

No, no, no sé si lo maldice o lo bendice mi corazón
Por que, usted sacó provecho de mí, abusó
Yo no sé lo que pasó, que usted de mi se burló
De mi cariño usted, se burló, me dejó, se rió

Por eso ahora ya yo no vuelvo a querer
Sacó provecho de mí, abusó
Abusó de mí cariño, abusó de mí cariño
Ay de mi cariño usted se burló
De mi también abusó, consuélate como yo

En amor todo es mentira

Arrancarme de mi son

Como una llama candente
Que quema para mi gente

Sigue la rumba en mi mente

me tracionaste, Macusa, ¡Qué triste yo me quedé! 

Me devolviste el retrato que en prueba de amor yo te di 
y me pediste tus cartas, en ellas decías así
""Te quiero mi cuchumbito, tú nunca me hagas sufrir""

Yo nunca usé la corbata, ni tampoco usé el pañuelo 
creyendo que así guardado conservaría el recuerdo

Las trazas se dieron cuenta que todo iba a ser traición 
se metieron en el cofre donde guardé mi pasión
destruyendo los recuerdos del engaño de un amor

Con los niveles de azúcar, que en mi es normal
Recuerde que soy oriunda de la tierra más fecunda
Y por las venas me corre un cañaveral

Y en mi garganta oirá cantar al sinsonte
Y escuchará en mi garganta brisas del mar

Cuando se ponga nervioso
Dile que él es superman

El que no corre vuela
El listo está de moda
Aquel que te quita y no te da
Lo mandamos pa' la cola

Un clavo saca otro clavo
Es la forma de olvidar
Hay que pasarle la cuenta
Al que tiene que pagar

El que no corre vuela
El listo está de moda
Aquel que te quita y no te da
Lo mandamos pa' la cola

Lo mandamos pa' la cola
Lo mandamos pa' la cola
Lo mandamos pa' la cola
Lo mandamos pa' la cola

El que no corre vuela
El listo está de moda
Aquel que te quita y no te da
Lo mandamos pa' la cola

Si tu marido es celoso
Y sufre de inseguridad
Ven escucha este consejo
Pa' que no moleste más

El que no corre vuela
El listo está de moda
Aquel que te quita y no te da
Lo mandamos pa' la cola

Cualquier herida, cualquier tiempo, cualquier soledad 
Sin que la pueda controlar 
Toma forma de canción, así es mi voz
Que sale de mi corazón 
Y volará, sin yo querer 
Por los caminos más lejanos 
Por los sueños que soñé 
Será reflejo del amor de lo que me tocó vivir 
Será la música de fondo de lo mucho que sentí 

Oye mi son, mi viejo son 
Tiene la clave de cualquier generación 
En el alma de mi gente, en el cuero del tambor 
En las manos del congero, en los pies del bailador 
Yo viviré, allí estaré 
Mientras pase una comparsa con mi rumba cantaré 
Seré siempre lo que fui, con mi azúcar para ti
Yo viviré, yo viviré 

Y ahora vuelvo a recordar, aquel tiempo atrás 
Cuando me fui buscando el cielo de la libertad 
Cuántos amigos que dejé y cuántas lagrimas lloré 
Yo viviré, para volverlos a encontrar 
Y seguiré, con mi canción 
Bailando música caliente como bailo yo 
Y cuando suene una guaracha 
Y cuando suene un huahuancó 
En la sangre de mi pueblo en su cuerpo estaré yo

no me hagas sufrir más rumbera

oye bien por tu mal comportamiento, 
te vas a arrepentir 
muy caro tendrás que pagar 
todo mi sufrimiento 
Llorarás y llorarás 
sin alguien que te consuele 
y así te darás de cuenta 
que si te engañan duele 

oye mira y después vendrás a mí, 
pidiéndome perdón 
pero ya mi corazón, 
no se acuerda más de tí 
Llorarás y llorarás 
sin nadie que te consuele 
y así te darás de cuenta 
que si te engañan duele 

CORO: Llorarás, llorarás, llorarás. 
Como lo sufrí yo 
Nadie te comprenderá 
Todo lo mala que has sido 
Mamita, tú lo pagaras.

Mi vida como yo quiero

I don't know where the time has gone 
But I really missed your smile it's been too long
I got so much to say that I don't know where to start
Ever since we went our seperate ways 
Been a big hole in my heart.
As I recall it was you that said goodbye
Now you're asking me to give it one more try.
 
Only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
And so my friend I hope you understand 
It's hard to put my trust in you 
'Cause i'm afraid you'll leave me again
I want to believe thatcha fin'ly seen the light 
That you miss my love and you want to make it right
 
But only time will tell
If you're gonna stand beside me through both heaven and hell 
I want to know that you're behind me
Only time will tell 
If what we have together gonna last forever more
Got no way of knowin' what the future's gonna bring
So I'll just listen to my heart 
Because it's never lied to me and what I left to be
Only time will tell if you're gonna stand beside me 
Through both heaven and hell I want to know if you're behind me 
Only time will tell 
What we have together gonna last forever
Hoo time will tell do you believe in me?
Only time will tell if we're gonna be together woa'
I wanna love that last forever",Cacungaca,2015

No acaba de llegar

Why hay quien a veces le falta
El respeto a una señora

Ya viene por la rotonda
Sale arrollando la gente
Como si fuera en la conga

Se empujan unos a otros

They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

what a mad day
Now I see everything in a different light
what a mad day
I was up in the air, and she taught me lesson alright

I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
Leaning over me, she was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher

what a mad day
Now I see everything in a different light
what a mad day
I was up in the air, and she taught me lesson alright

And everything seemed just right

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Celina da Piedade,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

Celinda Pink,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me

But now he says he knew about it from the start
 
Yeah, he knew about us all along

Celine Dion,"So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed
I felt into your eyes
Always thought of keepin'
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Oh

I need someone to give my heart to

I feel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger
And I feel it inside
Hearts are made to last

If there was any other way
No, there's no way out of this

Mmmm
Maybe I'd better be leaving now
But there's something

I never meant to get serious

Takes some getting used to

I'll paint the rain that softly lands on your wind blown hair 

I'll trace a hand to wipe out your tears 
A look to calm your fears 
A silhouette of dark and light 
While we hold each other oh so tight 

I'll paint a sun to warm your heart 
Swearing that we'll never part 
That's the color of my love 

I'll paint the truth 
Show how I feel

I'll use a brush so light and fine 
To draw you close and make you mine

We were stars on Sunset Boulevard 
What a movie we made 

There were days in the sun 
That have stayed forever young 
Nights when passion was invincible 
We thought love would never die

There were moments in that lifetime 
That my heart still replays 
There were minutes  there were hours  there were days 
There are moments I still love you that same way

De l'autre côté de ce mur
Il y a le soleil de la vie
Il y a des lèvres qui murmurent
À des lèvres assoiffées d'envie

Et prier cet homme sur la croix
C'est encore se donner à lui
Et quand lui viennent ces idées-là
C'est à peine si elle en rougit
La religieuse a comme moi
Des nuits d'amour en nostalgie
La religieuse a quelques fois
Des sanglots longs de jalousie

Même à genoux, même en prière
Elle a des frissons de désir
Tellement de sorciers l'ensorcellent
Que le diable y prend du plaisir

Elle a beau nouer ses cheveux
Sous une cornette anonyme
Elle ne sait pas baisser les yeux
La peur du mal l'enféminine

Et prier cet homme sur la croix
C'est encore se donner à lui
Et quand lui viennent ces idées-là

Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Baby I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground
'Cause when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
But baby this is serious (this is serious)

Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice

(Baby think twice) don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you (I depend on you)
Whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice (don't you leave, baby, no don't you leave baby)

La neige etend son manteau blanc

A genoux, les petits enfants
Avant de fermer les paupieres
Font une derniere priere

Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier

Mais avant de partir, il faudra bien te couvrir
Dehors tu dois avoir si froid
C'est un peu a cause de moi
Il me tarde tant que le jour se leve
Pour voir si tu m'as apporte
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en reves
Et que je t'ai commandes

Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier

Les enfants vont faire dodo
Et tu vas pouvoir commencer
Avec ta hotte sur le dos
Au son des cloches des eglises
Ta distribution de surprises

Petit Papa Noel, quand tu descendras du ciel
Avec des jouets par milliers
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier

Si tu dois t'arreter
Sur les toits du monde entier
Tout ca avant demain matin
Mets-toi vite vite en chemin
Et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage
Viens d'abord sur notre maison

Deux doigts sur un piano
Ce vieux piano a bon dos
Me suivre dans mes rêves
Ce n'est pas de tout repos

Sur les touches noires
Je mets mon désespoir
Ou bien je gare
Mes problèmes

C'est sur les touches blanches
Que je range
Mes «Je t'aime»

Alors ce piano-là
Ne sait plus où il va
Il pleure ou bien il rit
Ou les deux à la fois
Il fait des tremolos

Il est juste il est faux

Il mèlange tout
Le pire et le meilleur
Il colle bout à bout
Mineur et puis majeur
Il cogne un peu trop fort
Et se trompe d'accord

La do do la do
Je joue pianissimo
En rêvant d'un inconnu
Qui pour la vie entière
Me fera faire
Un pas de plus
Je n'ai que deux mains
Mais l'air que j'aime bien
Ne se joue qu'à quatre mains
Mais pourvu qu'il existe
Le pianiste
Que j'attends
Sinon ce piano-là
Ne sait plus où il va
Il pleure ou bien il rit
Ou les deux à la fois
Il fait des tremolos
Il est juste il est faux
En attendant qu'il vienne

Où rien ne se passe mais où rien ne s'oublie

Des musiques et des mots de France
Amants d'avant

Destins faits d'aventures, de records ou d'argent
Des vies d’écriture et de voyage
Ou de rêve de puissance

On ne devrait pas se séparer

Et j'ai la fièvre, fièvre, fièvre dans le sang 

C'est le monde à plus de 100 degrés
J'ai le ciel et l'enfer
J'ai l'amour et la guerre en moi
J'ai oublié tout ce que j'étais
Je marche et je me perds
Je ne vois plus à quatre pas 
Devant moi, devant moi
Et je brûle et tu brûleras
Avec moi, avec moi

Jours de feu

À corps perdu

Au fond de moi

Toutes ces nuits que j'ai passées
Seule à te caresser
Il faut que tu me les rendes, me les rendes
Une à une

Toutes ces nuits toute seule dans le noir de ma chambre
À rêver que tu viens me prendre
Me feras-tu encore attendre des jours, des mois?
Si tu ne viens pas, ce sera un autre
Si ce n'est pas toi, ce sera ta faute
Si je regrette toute ma vie
Ma première nuit d'amour

Trop jeune pour aimer

Un fan de Superman
Il collectionnait
Toutes les bandes dessinées
Où il pouvait voir son héros
Voler comme un oiseau

Et ses parents en étaient tellement fiers
Qu'ils décidèrent de faire
Pour son anniversaire
Un voyage éclair à New York
La ville de Superman
De leur chambre d'hôtel
Au cinquantième étage du Waldorf
La vue était si belle

Que leur première soirée
Ils la passèrent à regarder
Les lumières de Manhattan
Le lendemain
Ils marchèrent sur Broadway
Main dans la main
Comme dans un conte de fées

Et dans un magasin
Où l'on vend de tout de rien
Jean-Pierre se fit offrir par son père
Un costume de Superman
Dès ce soir-là
Il voulu le porter
Comme pyjama
Pour pouvoir mieux rêver

Mais quand ses parents
Se furent endormis
Tout près de lui dans le grand lit
Il se leva sans bruit
Il ouvrit la fenêtre
Et quand il vit apparaître
Les lumières de Manhattan
Il voulut s'envoler
Dans la nuit étoilée
Comme un oiseau qui plane

Qu'on a porté en terre

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
And I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Oh till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
'Cause if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know

Un coup d'œil à son dos, ses hanches, quand s'efface le galantin
Un regard quand elle se penche et laisse deviner un sein
Elle sait déjà ses mains, les contours de sa bouche
Le cambré de ses reins, qu'elle a noté en douce

Car le ballet va s'animer

Il a su les codes et donne les bons mots de passe

À l'ordre des choses et de nos pères

Gravée bien mieux que par une lame

Lourde, la peine en nos cœurs

Nos destins plus loin?

Au creux de tes mains

Take your gentle happiness
Far too beautiful for this
Cross over to the other shore
There is peace forevermore
But hold this memory bittersweet
Until we meet

On beyond the hands of time

Here and now is all that matters
Right here with you is where I'll stay

Everything in this world
Every voice in the night
Every little thing of beauty
Comes shining through in your eyes
And all that is you becomes part of me too
'Cause all you do seduces me

And if I should die tomorrow
I'd go down with a smile on my face
I thank God I've ever known you
I fall down on my knees
For all the love we've made

Every sigh in the night
Every tear that you cry
Seduces me, oh, seduces me
And all that you do,
Seduces me",Seduces Me,1996

I finished crying in the instant that you left 
And I can't remember where or when or how 
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

And whenever you tried to hurt me 
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper 

There were hours that just went on for days 
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances 
That were lost to us forever (forever)

But you were history with the slamming of the door 
And I made myself so strong again somehow 
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

And if you kiss me like that

You're letting this die 
Without the blink of an eye 
You say that you need time 
I say you'll be fine 

If you would only see 
Like you did before
You became imprisoned 
Can I reopen the door 

You say it doesn't matter 
Then tell me what does 
And why that isn't what 
You've been thinking of 
You say it's never easy 
Then tell me what was 
Is it never worth the pain 
Could you believe it was 

When life keeps living 
That's what life keeps giving 
To us 

Once we were one mind 
Drifting in one time 
And ever true 
We were friends 
But something is gone from my 
Picture of this life 

If we could only see 
Like we did before 
We became imprisoned 
Can I reopen the door 

You say it doesn't matter 
Then tell me what does 
And why that isn't what 
What you've been thinking of 
You say it's never easy 
Then tell me what was 
Is it never worth the pain 
Could you believe it was 

When life keeps living 
That's what life keeps giving 
To us 

The hope has vanished from your eyes 
You were my faith and one truth 
There's every reason to get through 
And you're why I know there's a reason

If we could only see
Like we did before
We became imprisoned
Can I reopen the door

You say it doesn't matter
Then tell me what does
And why that isn't what

All the heavens would call them angels 'round
Stop the tears from troubled sky's, from 
Falling, falling, falling.

If ever the river could whisper your name,
Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain,
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
The love that sees no color lines?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered,
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

If ever a boy stood on the moon,
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are.
Together we'd chase the sun.

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
The love that answers a mother's cry?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered.
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

I'll never forget you, so

Never sure that love would grow 
Now at night as I lay me down to sleep 
I could never let you go, no

And lying here with you 
I still can't believe it's true 
Never thought that I would ever
Find a love that lasts forever

Be the man that's mine 
Find the love that never goes away 
Be the heart I know will be 
The one that beats for me, be the man 

Used to be scared if I would ever get this close
I'm not afraid to touch you now 
Long before I knew, I'd be making love to you
I dreamed that maybe I would one day 
Lose myself in someone, someday 

Be the man that's mine 
I always try to find the love that never goes away
Be the heart I know will be 
The one that beats for me, be the man 

Take me where I've never been, oh baby
I will follow you, you'll never be alone 
I will run, run to you, yeah (yeah)
I never thought that I would ever
Find a love that lasts forever

Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know
How to fly

I'll be the first to help you try

Ne sont pas faits que d'innocence
Ils sont faits de chair et de sang

Au nom de l'amour, je voudrais te voir faire des folies
Renoncer à toi-même et quelques fois bousculer l'ordre de ta vie

Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there

I know I need never care
But to love him is to need him everywhere

Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
I'll be there

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on changeait les choses un peu, rien qu'en aimant donner
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Je ferais de ce monde un rêve, une éternité

J'ai du sang dans mes songes, un pétale séché
Quand des larmes me rongent que d'autres ont versées
La vie n'est pas étanche, mon île est sous le vent
Les portes laissent entrer les cris même en fermant

Dans un jardin, l'enfant, sur un balcon des fleurs
Ma vie paisible où j'entends battre tous les cœurs
Quand les nuages foncent, présages des malheurs
Quelles armes répondent aux pays de nos peurs?

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on changeait les choses un peu, rien qu'en aimant donner
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Je ferais de ce monde un rêve, une éternité

S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Si l'on pouvait changer les choses et tout recommencer
S'il suffisait qu'on s'aime, s'il suffisait d'aimer
Nous ferions de ce rêve un monde
S'il suffisait d'aimer",S'il Suffisait d'Aimer,1998
Celine Dion,"Sur les passerelles à l'embarquement
Populaires ou premières, derrière ou devant
On monte les malles, des quais sur le pont
On charge dans les cales de l'acier, des jurons
Ne manque plus qu'un signe, du capitaine un mot
Des cabines aux cuisines
Sur le même bateau
Un doigt de champagne, un toast au départ
Dans les soutes, le bagne et les heures de quart
Des soirées mondaines, des valses ou tangos
Aux ombres, à la peine, un mauvais tord boyau
En attendant l'escale, Athènes ou Macao
Sous les mêmes étoiles
Sur le même bateau

Au feu des machines, souffre matelot
Près de la piscine, les belles et les beaux
Des salles de moteurs, des salons joyaux
Ici la sueur, le plus grand luxe en haut
Mais vienne une tempête, une lame en sursaut
Toutes les âmes s'inquiètent
Sur le même bateau

Quand les astres s'en mêlent sur l'immense océan
Quand tout devient si frêle face aux éléments
Plus de rang, plus de classe, plus de bagne ou de beau
Chacun la même angoisse
Sur le même bateau",Sur le Même Bateau,1998
Celine Dion,"Terre
J'ai passé trop de temps sur la route
À espérer les faibles traces que tu as semées

Terre
Si tu savais combien je t'ai manqué
Ces journées sans boussole, je l'ai souvent prié

Terre
Que font les amants qui se retrouvent?
Que dois-je mettre ce soir?
Un tien de parfum, de l'alcool ou du blues?

Terre
De mots doux qui tremblent et nichent partout
De silences bavards, de paupières contre joues

Et qu'importe le jeu
J'ai ce que je veux
Hisser le pavillon bleu

Terre
Terre d'asile, sur ta peau de velours
Glissent les encore et les toujours

Terre promise, les oiseaux se souviennent
De nos corps en drapeaux qui claquent et qui s'aiment

Terre
Terre de feu, sans issue de secours
Et nos braises rouges se consomment à leur tour

Terre
Oubliée la mer des songes tabous
Et les secondes passent un peu plus vite chaque jour

Terre
Bien ancrée sur le sol de tes charmes
J'ai laissé les étoiles guider mes bras vers ton cou

Et ton œil complice
À graver sur mes reins
Plus jamais, jamais peur de rien
Car ce soir j'ai touché

Terre d'asile, sur ta peau de velours
Aux courbures de la fin du jour

De toute ma voix, de toute mon âme
""With all the soul that I can""
Le blues comme on me l'a appris
""I woke up this morning, baby""
Mais ce matin-là, j'ai compris

La peine aux longs champs de coton

Les coups, le sang, les temps boueux
J'avais mal en fermant les yeux
""His baby's far away""
J'ai des pardons, j'ai des prières
Mais l'blues c'est pas des phrases en l'air

""I woke up this morning, baby""
Mais ce matin t'as vraiment froid
Tu comprends du fond de ta poitrine
Tous les blues sont écrits pour toi

""Oh, oh I feel the blues in me
Nobody knows how I really feel
Nobody knows, nobody cares""

I know that you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keepin' those words deep down in my heart

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

I never been much for occasions
But you never let another birthday go by
Without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there, right there in your eyes

And were still holding hands when were walkin'
Actin' like we've only just met
But how could that be when there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side

Celine Dion,"No mountains too high, for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

And then you will see, the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see?

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel 

And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near (end is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight (oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel (I'll be)

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are

Celine Dion,"I would fight not to ever fall too deep 
Never sure that love would grow 
Now at night as I lay me down to sleep 
I could never let you go, no

And lying here with you 
I still can't believe it's true 
Never thought that I would ever
Find a love that lasts forever

Be the man that's mine 
Find the love that never goes away 
Be the heart I know will be 
The one that beats for me, be the man 

Used to be scared if I would ever get this close
I'm not afraid to touch you now 
Long before I knew, I'd be making love to you
I dreamed that maybe I would one day 
Lose myself in someone, someday 

Be the man that's mine

In the living of each day

Celine Dion,"(Bryan Adams, Elliott Kennedy, Jean-Jacques Goldman)
Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love

From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain...

Lets talk about love
Lets talk about us
Lets talk about life
Lets talk about trust
Lets talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - ¡®til the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Lets talk about love - it's all were needin'
Lets talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'
Lets talk about life - I want to know you
Lets talk about trust - and I want to show you
Lets talk about love",Let's Talk About Love,2001

Another night away from you
You're the reason I go on
And now I need to live the truth
Right now, there's no better time
From this fear I will break free
And I'll live again with love
And no they can't take that away from me
And they will see

I'll be there for you all the way
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you, mamma


I'll your beacon through the darkest nights
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you 'till forever comes

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye

Until then...

Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on Christmas day

Twentyfourth of December
It was a cold and snowing night
I still can remember Gazing at the stars and the moonlight
Fell asleep on a sofabed
Dreams of Christmas in my head
But I woke up to my surprise
There he was right in front of my eyes

Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on Christmas day

I was stuffing the stockings
And hanging tincel on the tree
When I heard him knocking
I opened the door in time to see
Carollers sing ""Silver Bells""
I saw his face, that's when I fell
He was there bent on one knee
Santa sent him just for me

Listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me
I met an angel on a Christmas day

Yeah, yeah

And I know this love will grow
When flowers bloom in early spring
I'll be his bride
I'll wear his ring

So if your looking for an angel who,
Is gonna make your every dream come true
Just write a letter saying Santa hey,
I'll need an angel next Christmas day'

Yeah
Yeah, yeah baby
Ooh

Ding, ding, dong, ding

Listen up what I got to say, hey
I found true love and it's here to stay
Chapel bells are gonna ring and ring in me
I met an angel on a Christmas day

Ooh, listen up to what I got to say
I found true love and it's here to stay

Chapel bells are gonna ring
Chapel bells are gonna ring

I met an angel on a Christmas day

Listen up to what I got to say
True love and it's on its way
I met an angel on a Christmas day

Yeah

On a Christmas day

Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, i found my strength

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?

Effacés, disparus en un battement de cœur

Bouts d'aveux déchirés dans des corbeilles à papier

Rayés comme si tout ça n'avait jamais été

Tout enregistrer, ajouter le son les odeurs
ADN, empreintes, mais que jamais rien ne meure
Ces millions de films de nous, mais pas du cinéma
Toutes les scènes perdues que l'on ne jouait pas

On ouvrirait tous les jours où nous serions moins forts
Tous ces embryons d'amour, toutes ces aurores
Sincères, démasqués, fragiles et vrais de candeur
Nous revoir ainsi nous rendrait peut-être meilleurs

Des milliers de mots doux sur des pare-brises envolés
Numéros composés sans jamais oser parler
Bouts d'aveux déchirés dans des corbeilles à papier
Les défroisser, les recoller, lire et les garder

Des milliers de caresses au millimètre carré
Des milliers de cris, de souffles à nos bouches échappés
Dans de ciels effleurés, touchés, sommeils emmêlés
Rayés comme si tout ça n'avait jamais été

Je voudrais tout ramasser dans des grands sacs poubelle
Les paroles oubliées, des plus banales aux plus belles
Qu'aucun ne se perde de ces instants si précieux
Ces phrases ont été dites, ces moments ont eu lieu

Tout enregistrer, ajouter le son les odeurs
ADN, empreintes, mais que jamais rien ne meure
Ces millions de films de nous, mais pas du cinéma
Toutes les scènes perdues que l'on ne jouait pas

On ouvrirait tous les jours où nous serions moins forts
Tous ces embryons d'amour, toutes ces aurores
Sincères, démasqués, fragiles et vrais de candeur
Nous revoir ainsi nous rendrait peut-être meilleurs

Des milliers de baisers, des milliers de milliers
Un à un de nos lèvres sur des peaux déposées
Des milliers de pensées, de moments d'éternité
De regards échangés dans des gares, échangés
Des milliers de baisers en un clin d'œil oubliés",Des Milliers de Baisers [Album Version] [Version],2003
Celine Dion,"Je lui dirai qu'il est de ce pays
Où son grand-père était bûcheron
Que dans son sang l'Orient coule aussi
Que les mélanges font de beaux enfants
Qu'il est fort et bien vivant

Je lui dirai qu'il est né de l'amour
Que nous l'attendions passionnément
Que chaque nuit s'efface au nouveau jour
Qu'il sera grand mais qu'il a bien le temps
Oh Dieu, qu'il a bien le temps

Et que la vie l'appelle, que le monde l'attend

Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie

Je lui dirai qu'ici-bas, tout s'apprend
Le bien, le mal et même le bonheur
Qu'il ne perde jamais ses yeux d'enfant
Devant trop de malheurs et de laideur
Qu'il regarde avec son cœur

Je lui dirai d'être sage et prudent
D'aller frôler les glaces et les feux
Qu'il goûte à tout mais sans jamais dépendre
Que trop peut être pire que trop peu
Oh, bien pire que trop peu

Et que la vie l'appelle, que le monde l'attend
Que la terre est si belle et le ciel est si grand
Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie
Qu'il est un parmi des millions d'humains
Mais bien l'unique pour moi

Je lui dirai les chansons, les poèmes
Qu'il n'y a pas d'amour sans histoire
Que le bonheur est un grain que l'on sème
Qu'amour et santé ne s'achètent pas
Et qu'on n'est riche que de ça

Je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
Viendra l'aimer et qu'il l'aimera
Que j'en mourrai de bonheur et de larmes
Mais que nous serons là pas après pas
Que c'est la vie et sa loi

But it really feels that good

Waiting for something that was heaven-sent
When you find it don't let go,

Have you ever said a prayer
And found that it was answered

And I ain't looking anymore

But I could never be
I could never be
I could never be
I could never be

Celine Dion,"I cry and you comfort me
I'm lost and you hear my scream
So it's hard to watch you falling
When you run so deep in me
You live in me

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

I walk but you can run through fire
I search for reasons and baby you inspire
But I know somebody hurt you
And I know you really need a friend
Well you can take my hand

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

So when you're feeling like you can't go on
Don't you know
You never walk alone no
And you live in me

Gonna stand by your side now
Let me kiss all your tears away
You can stay in my arms now
And I know I can make you believe again

I'm gonna stand, stand by your side
Kiss all your tears away tonight
I'm gonna stand, stand by your side
Make you believe again
I want to look in your eyes now and see you smiling again",Stand by Your Side,2003
Celine Dion,"Loin, loin, c'était certain
Comme une immense faim, un animal instinct
Oh, partir, partir et filer plus loin
Tout laisser, quitter tout, rejoindre un destin

Bye bye, mais faut que je m'en aille
Adieu tendres années, salut champs de bataille
Et sentir, oh sentir et lâcher les chiens
Y'a trop de trains qui passent, ce train c'est le mien

Et tant pis pour moi, et tant pis pour nous
J'aurais pu rester où la roue tourne, où tout est doux
Moi j'avais pas le choix, ça cognait partout
Le monde est à ta porte et se joue des verrous

Rendez-vous dans un autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Quand les nuits seront plus longues plus longues que mes nuits
Et mourir, oh mourir, mais de vivre et d'envie
Rendez-vous quand j'aurai dévoré mes appétits

Beau, beau de bas en haut
J'aimais manger sa peau j'aimais boire à ses mots
Mais trop tard, ou brouillard, ou bien trop tôt
c'était la bonne histoire mais pas le bon tempo

Bye bye, faut que je m'en aille
Une croix sur ses lèvres et ma vie qui s'écaille
Et s'offrir et souffrir et tomber de haut
Et descendre et descendre au fond sur le carreau

Et tant pis pour moi, et tant pis pour lui
Je pourrais l'attendre ici, rien ne s'oublie tout est gris
Moi j'avais pas le choix, ça cognait aussi
C'est le monde à ta porte et tu lui dis merci

Rendez-vous dans un autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Quand les nuits seront plus longues plus longues que mes nuits
Et mourir, oh mourir, mais de vivre et d'envie
Rendez-vous quand j'aurai dévoré mes appétits

Rendez-vous dans un autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Une autre chance, une seconde et tant pis pour celle-ci
Et puis rire à périr, mais rire aujourd'hui
Rendez-vous quelque part entre ailleurs et l'infini
Rendez-vous quand j'aurai dévoré mes appétits
Rendez-vous quelque part entre ailleurs et l'infini
C'est le monde à ta porte et tu lui dis merci

Rendez-vous dans une autre monde ou dans une autre vie
Une autre chance, une seconde et tant pis pour celle-ci

Celine Dion,"On ne change pas
On met juste les costumes d'autres sur soi
On ne change pas
Une veste ne cache qu'un peu de ce qu'on voit
On ne grandit pas
On pousse un peu, tout juste
Le temps d'un rêve, d'un songe
Et les toucher du doigt

Mais on n'oublie pas
L'enfant qui reste, presque nu
Les instants d'innocence
Quand on ne savait pas

On ne change pas
On attrape des airs et des poses de combat
On ne change pas
On se donne le change, on croit
Que l'on fait des choix
Mais si tu grattes là
Tout près de l'apparence tremble
Un petit qui nous ressemble
On sait bien qu'il est là
On l'entend parfois
Sa rengaine insolente
Qui s’entête et qui répète
Oh ne me quitte pas

On n'oublie jamais
On a toujours un geste
Qui trahit qui l'on est
Un prince, un valet
Sous la couronne un regard
Une arrogance, un trait
D'un prince ou d'un valet
Je sais tellement ça
J'ai copié des images
Et des rêves que j'avais
Tous ces milliers de rêves
Mais si près de moi
Une petite fille maigre
Marche à Charlemagne, inquiète
Et me parle tout bas

On ne change pas, on met juste
Les costumes d'autres et voilà
On ne change pas, on ne cache
Qu'un instant de soi

Une petite fille
Ingrate et solitaire marche
Et rêve dans les neiges
En oubliant le froid

Si je la maquille
Elle disparaît un peu
Le temps de me regarder faire
Et se moquer de moi

Une petite fille
Une toute petite fille
Une toute petite fille
Une toute petite fille, oh yeah",On Ne Change Pas [Album Version] [Version],2003
Celine Dion,"Terre
J'ai passe trop de temps sur la route
À espérer les faibles traces que tu as semées

Terre
Si tu savais combien je t'ai manque
Ces journées sans boussole, je l'ai souvent prie

Terre
Que font les amants qui se retrouvent?
Que dois-je mettre ce soir?
Un tien de parfum, de l'alcool ou du blues?

Terre
De mots doux qui tremblent et nichent partout
De silences bavards, de paupières contre joues

Et qu'importe le jeu
J'ai ce que je veux
Hisser le pavillon bleu
Car ce soir j'ai touche

Terre
Terre d'asile, sur ta peau de velours
Glissent les encore et les toujours

Terre
Terre promise, les oiseaux se souviennent
De nos corps en drapeaux qui claquent et qui s'aiment

Terre
Terre de feu, sans issue de secours
Et nos braises rouges se consomment à leur tour

Terre
Oubliée la mer des songes tabous
Et les secondes passent un peu plus vite chaque jour

Terre
Bien ancrée sur le sol de tes charmes
J'ai laisse les étoiles guider mes bras vers ton cou

Et ton œil complice
À graver sur mes reins
Plus jamais, jamais peur de rien
Car ce soir j'ai touche

Terre
Terre d'asile, sur ta peau de velours
Aux courbures de la fin du jour

Terre
Terre brûlée au langage du désir
Danse du ciel
Caresses, partage et soupirs

Terre étrangère, mais si proche pourtant
C'est ici que je veux mourir maintenant

Celine Dion,"Une rue, les gens passent, les gens comme on les voit
Juste un flux, une masse, sans visage, sans voix
Quel étrange aujourd'hui, quelque chose, mais quoi?
Désobéit, désobéit

Une rue comme d'autres et le temps se suspend
Une tache, une faute et soudain tu comprends
Impudence inouïe, insolite, indécent
Zora sourit, Zora sourit

Zora sourit, aux trottoirs, aux voitures, aux passants
Au vacarme, aux murs, au mauvais temps
À son visage nu sous le vent
À ses jambes qui dansent en marchant
À tout ce qui nous semble évident
Elle avance et bénit chaque instant
Zora sourit, Zora sourit, Zora sourit

Des phrases sur les murs, des regards de travers
Parfois quelques injures, elle en a rien à faire
Elle distribue ses sourires, elle en reçoit autant
Zora sourit, effrontément
Zora sourit, insolemment

Zora sourit pour elle, elle sourit d'être là
Mais elle sourit pour celles, celles qui sont là-bas
Pour ces femmes, ses sœurs qui ne savent plus sourire
Alors des larmes plein le cœur, des larmes plein la vie
Zora sourit yé, Zora sourit yé, Zora sourit",Zora Sourit [Album Version] [Version],2003

Never had secrets, always singing your praises now good and loud
All I got is questions, and you left me wondering why
Why you keep your distance, every lonely night

When love was bound together
We lived it by the letter
Can't close my eyes forever
'Cause everything has changed and now

I ain't gonna look the other way, no more

Celine Dion,"[Moss]

Immersed in light, broken in flight,
Here comes that scene again,
Not another sleepless night.
Scripted yet stuck on every line,
Upon my face a look of pure surprise,
I thought I'd be fighting fire.

How it's changed from my dream,
Did I stray from the path laid out for me?
How it's changed,
Did I fail in some way?

Easy to plot a course divine,
A simple graph can't cover ever line,
and I don't see what I don't know.

My lonely days are over, and life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah at last the skies above are blue

I found a dream, that I can speak to
A dream that I, can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to

I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak

Never know how much I care

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago, that's right

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Oh Daddy, don't you dare""

He gives me fever when he kisses me
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
""Oh daddy, won't you treat him right""

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

My dearest one, my sleepy one 
It's time to go to bed 
My precious one, my darling one 
Don't let your lashes weep 
My cherished one, my weary one 
It's time to go to sleep 
Just bow your head 
And give your cares to me 
Just close your eyes 
And fall into the sweetest dream 
'Cause in my loving arms 
You're safe as you will ever be 
So hush my dear and sleep 
And in your dreams 
You'll ride on angels' wings 
Dance with the stars 
And touch the face of god 
And if you should awake 
My precious one, my tiny one 
I'll kiss your little cheek 
And underneath the smiling moon 
I'll sing you back to sleep",My Precious One,2004
Celine Dion,"I see trees of green, red roses too 
I see them bloom for me and you 
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
I see skies of blue and clouds of white 
The bright blessed day, dark sacred night 
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky 
Are also on the faces of people going by 
I see friends shaking hands, saying ""how do you do? "" 
They're really saying ""i love you"" 
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow 
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know 
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
I see trees of green, red roses too 
I see them bloom for me and you 
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world",What a Wonderful World,2004

On pousse un peu, tout juste

Celine Dion,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother will disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah
Then finally make me do just what my mama says
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that will never, never end
'Cause I'd love, I'd love to dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could you send back the only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again
Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Dance With My Father,2005

Every heart would have a new song to sing

Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be happiness that no man could end

Riding on horses, boys with guitars
If you really wanna get the root of me
You don't have to try so hard

Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you wanna know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart

I cry for no reason
I laugh at awkward moments
There's no manual that explains where I'm going
So show me the way, show me the way

White chocolate kisses under the stars
Riding on horses, boys with guitars
If you really want to know how to get to me
Follow the map to my heart

You played that thing like you're talking again
You strum those strings like an angel of love
Did you notice I can't focus on nothing else?
What's making me come out of my shell?
Sometimes it's so hard to tell
I don't even know myself when you do, yeah, you do

Oh baby, don't ask for directions
I'm tired of explaining
There's no book I've read that says what I'm saying
So show me the way, show me the way

Give me a reason to dance in the dark
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart
If you really want to get the root of me

If you wanna know how to get to me

Ma première nuit d'amour

Trop jeune pour aimer

Celine Dion,"I learned from the past
Not everything lasts
I understand that now
Everything changed
When you walked away
But I'll survive somehow
Though I have regrets
I'll learn to forget
And just keep moving on
Cause when love is gone
You have to be strong
Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away

So I try to smile
But after a while
The memories come back
But I won't give in
Cause I know that then
My heart will fade to black

And this time I learned
That love can burn
It's an all consuming flame
There's no right or wrong

I've got to be strong

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away

I know that one day I'll find that feeling again
But until I do I'll do fine by myself

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
You know that

Once touched by pain
You're not the same
But time can heal
Your heart again
So let the clouds
That bring you down
So let the clouds
That bring you down
Just fade away
Away",Fade Away,2010
Celine Dion,"I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight

No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone? How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown, alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone

The rise & fall

I can't hold a smile

No matter how hard
I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you?
Did you know that I could see you through?
How did you know that I would play the part?
I must have made it clear right from the start

My love can you give me strength?
Some how I forgot how to ease my pain
I know I'm right where I belong
But something for nothing never proved me wrong

I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you?

How did you know that I would play the part?

Would you do the same for me?
I would give all I am to you
Would you do the same for me?

Yes I'll stand tall to get by

You could you see?
I could break
Did you notice all my mistakes?
There were times that I felt you read my mind

Où la valse était reine 
Où l'amour était roi

Everybody's searching for a hero

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Try to follow where it leads me, that's right.
I don't wake up in the shadows anymore.
I can finally breathe

I dig a little deep down searching
Took a little time to work it through
But I found everything
The day that I had you

I once was the lost one
Like a wayward child
Now you're the light that leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl

I'm picking up all the pieces
When I put 'em back together I'm like new
'Cause my greatest wish
Has already come true

We'll always be connected baby
Like a button to a sleeve
And this lullaby
Will send you off to sleep

It's hard to imagine
My life before you
'Cause you're the light that leads the way

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day
I will always try to make it
Better than it was for me

You'll always be the first one in my prayers
Just close your eyes and I am there
It's a better world
Since you're my boy I'll always be your girl

I'll be holding the wrap if you come on and fall
There is love after love after all

We'll always be connected baby
You're like a button on my sleeve
And this lullaby, oh

I can melt the drops of freezing rain
I'll fly in and save the day

Celine Dion,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve.
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly""

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
The small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly ducking girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me at seventeen",At Seventeen,2013

Really want a change
Then I must admit
That I'm the one to blame

For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever

Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn?

Is too weak to let live on

Go and lay my body down

Let them play their little games
Of who loves who and what is true

A guy like you ain't meant to go away, no no

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.

I guess we're like water and a flame.

I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a guy that looked like you,
I did not know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,

The day has come for us to say I do
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It's written in the stars, it's destiny

So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you

We'll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They'll learn to say hello, and say goodbye
We'll grow grey and old, and live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we'll stay together
Forever and ever

So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you

How can something so right feel so wrong inside
How can something so good, leave me feeling so bad
How can my dreams coming true, leave me lonely and blue
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad
How can I feel the high when I feel so low

After all we've been through after coming so far
Is this my destiny

Celine Dion,"Quand dans tes bras
Tu m'as serrée
Mon cœur s'est arrêté de battre
Tu ignorais
Dans quelle contrée
Tu t'en allais combattre
J'ai supplié:
""Laissez-le moi!""
Mais ils sont venus te chercher
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Pour me parler d'amour
Que toi qui me répondes
Quand j'appelle au secours
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Que toi à qui confier
Mes blessures profondes
Et mes rêves brisés
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Et si je te perdais
Je crois que j'en mourrais
Tu sais
Tu t'en allais
Porter la paix
À un peuple en détresse
Sans hésiter
Tu étais prêt
À donner ta jeunesse
Tu étais beau
Comme un héros
Sur ta dernière photo
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Pour me parler d'amour
Que toi qui me répondes
Quand j'appelle au secours
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Reviendras-tu vivant
De cette guerre immonde
Vivant mais comme avant?
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Et si je te perdais
Je crois que j'en mourrais
Tu sais
Je n'ai que toi au monde
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as fait
De tes deux bras
Qui ne pourront plus me serrer?
Je n'ai que toi au monde
À qui parler d'amour
Que toi qui me répondes

Tant de temps
Déluge de silence

Sur l'eau de ma mémoire
Sous la proue
D'un amour qui s'échoue

Oh, ma vie
Pourquoi suis-je tombé de haut
Sur le banc des gens normaux
Dans mes mains
Y'a plus rien
Que du pain pour les oiseaux

Tant de temps
À respirer tes lettres
Ces instants
Qui ne peuvent pas renaître
Dans nos yeux
Qui ne croient plus en nous deux

Tant de temps
Qui me ronge les ongles
Jusqu'au sang
À blanchir ton ombre
J'ai si peur
Des fantômes du bonheur

Toutes ces nuits
À survivre loin de toi
Dans le vide de tes bras
Accroché à l'amour
Sous l'avalanche des jours

Celine Dion,"If ever a boy stood on the moon
All the heavens would call them angels 'round
Stop the tears from troubled sky's, from 
Falling, falling, falling.

If ever the river could whisper your name,
Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain,
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
The love that sees no color lines?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered,
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

If ever a boy stood on the moon,
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are.
Together we'd chase the sun.

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
The love that answers a mother's cry?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings and fly,
Guide your spirit safe and sheltered.
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

The ancient souls can still discover
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
That we can still believe
We can still believe

Je songerai à céder ma place

Que de l'amour, que du bonheur 

J'aime mon prochain, j'aime mon public 
Tout c'que je veux, c'est que ça clique 
J'me fous pas mal de la critique 
Quand je chante, c'est pour le public 
J'suis pas un animal de cirque 
Ma vie à moi, c'est la musique 

Si je chante, c'est pour qu'on m'entende 
Quand je crie, c'est pour me défendre 
J'aimerais bien me faire comprendre 
Je voudrais faire le tour de la terre 
Avant d'mourir, et qu'on m'enterre

Et ces visages d'enfants, et le mien dans ce miroir

Oh, c'est pas pour me plaindre, ça vous n'avez rien à craindre

Ô mon Dieu, j'ai eu ma part

À peine le temps de s'y faire, à peine on doit laisser la place

Encore un soir, encore une heure
Encore une larme de bonheur
Une faveur comme une fleur
Un souffle, une erreur
Un peu de nous, un rien de tout
Pour tout se dire encore ou bien se taire
Un regard, juste un report
À peine encore, même s'il est tard

Si j'aimais rien demandé, ça c'est pas la mer à boire
Allez, face à l'éternité, ça va même pas se voir
Ça resteras entre nous, ô juste un lèger retard

Y'en a tant qui tuent le temps
Tant et tant qu'ils le perdent ou le passent

Aiyo, get nice
Shoot dice
Skip the small talk
Son, advance to BOARDWALK
Collectin properties and profit
Expand and make dough
Yo, slide past GO

[ Phantasm ]
Check the drama as the saga starts to enfold
To advance and pass GO and get the pot of gold
In the MEDITERRANEAN
Met this fly lady, and
She had two lovers
The rich Parker Brothers
On the run from the IRS for INCOME TAX
After this heist, son, we sittin on stacks
In this new community lookin for the Treasure Chest
Took a wrong left turn, fuck it yo, nevertheless
It's my fault, kid
We ended up on BALTIC
Off course
But still we ain't takin a loss
There he go, READING at the RAILROAD in his Porsche
Waitin for his brother to come in on the iron horse

[ U.G. ]
Can it be so simple?
Playin in my rental on ORIENTAL
AVENUE passin through CONNECTICUT
Got to get the burn mark just to VISIT Matt Life in the clink (/JAIL)
I'm bagged for stolen minks and snatchin links
[ Phantasm ]
At ST. CHARLES PLACE
Let me check Digga and Masta Ase
And the Inc.
They own ELECTRIC COMPANY
Next is the state of VIRGINIA, with Rhamadan
And got Mad Skillz like Shaqwan
At the train station
We waitin
For my PENNSYLVANIA connect
To come through and show us love and respect
Don't even take aim, cause he's a SAINT like JAMES
And when you're done with the body burn em in the flames

Sippin Hennessy on TENNESSEE
With Hav and P
Seen Schott Free, asked me to walk to NEW YORK
AVENUE, bag two chicks who whips were stashed at FREE PARKING
We seen Lou Diamond with Tony Starks, then
Some kid tried to buck me
On KENTUCKY
Some gang named CHANCE wore bandanas
So I ran to INDIANA
(ILLINOIS/) ILLA NOYZ and his boys
Held me down and got my back
Pass the gat, yes, I'm just cool like that

[ CHORUS ]

[ Phantasm ]
It's after three, yo
We at B&0
Amtrak and MARVIN GARDENS
A player like Phantasm is starvin
Check the fountain and see if the WATER WORKS
While I send four

I was on ATLANTIC
With my man Quick
To snatch jewels and hit the scale
Seen 50, didn't want to GO TO JAIL
On PENNSYLVANIA
I met Lorena
She had on Guess
She said (you need a vest
goin through COMMUNITY CHEST)
Or NC, NORTH CAROLINA if you visit
You look exquisite
????? made by PACIFIC
Kicked a SHORT LINE
Shorty was mine
She was with it
I got the digits
But never got the CHANCE to hit it

At PARK PLACE
Hit the Parker Brothers' safe
And made a killin

[Chorus]
Perfect combination
Ain't no other relationship
Like this
I know we're gonna last forever

At the edge of my bed I sit back and reminisce
Long talks and walks and also your soft kiss
We went shopping at Macy's, skating at Lacey's
Cut off all my dime pieces, even thick Stacey
Thinkin' in this rental blastin' instrumentals
How we first met was all on my mental
It was at Great Adventure, the 'Batman Ride'
Thought I was deaded 'cause first this fat man tried
The sun, beamin', federation schemin'
But you was clockin' DiBiase, musta been day-dreamin'
Waitin' on line, wishin' she was all mine
Shootin' the gift, exchanged digits, the whole nine
Spent about 850 in Atlantic City
After you, boo, my attitude is real sh

Scenery sunny, act one, near a money machine
Jumped out the cream Lex with Jacks, she rocked a black tennis skirt
With Stan Smith's, about a size 6
Jewels, chinky eyes, long hair, bow legged, her thighs
Was thick like she ran track, for what it's worth
Shortie was made from the best things on this Earth
Like a Snapple I wanted to drink her to quench my thirst
Jumped in the coupe and threw my joint in reverse
Hey boo, I was watchin' you (I was watchin' you)
Here's my number (true) call me at the crib at 2

[Chorus]

Hey yo, tell me what went wrong to make me write this song
Used to have it going on, our feelings was so strong
Your age 26, my number one draft pick
From all the rest, got first dibs plus your own crib
You just flew back in town (from where, son?) from Dallas
And said she wants the Tall Man to come to her palace
I'm over there tonight to watch the Bulls catch licks
From the Knicks and at halftime I watch Rod Strick's
Get bizzynizm, I feel lucky to shoot the gizm
In her triangular prism, and that's the realism
(Where does she live, kid?) Out in Bed-Stuy
(Do-or-Die?) come on now, baby, 'cause I'm packin'

I got the phone call at 2 (it's me, boo) oh
She said (you know, why don't you come to the crib-o?
We could wine and dine and relax on the low
And drink Mo, by the way, I just saw your video)
Yeah, true, I'm comin' through, give me a hour
Jumped out the shower and buried my body in baby powder
Dipped wears plus my hair smells like Nexus
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Yo, I jump into the Lexus
On the highway, it's a Friday, can't wait to see her
I picked up two slices from the local pizzeria

[Chorus]

Got to the crib about 8, she told me wait in the living room
Be back real soon, on HBO tonight is ""Platoon""
Laid back in this recliner, sex on my minder
Playin' Pitty Pat watchin' ""Fritz the Cat""

Whip in the drive-way and do want to club, playin' Nas 'One Love'
Drinkin' OE, she told me her address was double 0-3
I slowly walked up the steps and rung her back bell
Talkin' on my cell

I skated to the back, I see Black Knights and smell Fahrenheit
That's when shortie took flight

What's the deal, fam? What's the real plan, shortie flashed
Knockin' over trash like she was runnin' a 40 yard dash
Let's hit the club and start from scratch
'Cause all I wanted us to be was the perfect match

Held in time
In a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin'home

Holding you
Loving you loving you

It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no-one to love you you're
Goin' nowhere

When you lose control and you got no soul

When the morning cries and you don't know why

Burning love
With a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go
And I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you

Loving you loving you

One by one goes the bullets in the clip
Put it in yo gat, one in the chamber, now you're ready to start shit
Heat comin from the barrel with a cloud of smoke
Dead bodies on the ground when these fools get loc'ed
It's crazy in the street, pack some heat for a sucker
Mobbin through the town tryin to murder muthafuckas
211's every day, liquor store and bank jobs
D boys gettin robbed, niggas get jacked for they mobbs
What's a nigga to do, can't survive without a gun
Snitches in the street, a nigga livin on the run
It's fun but the pen is like smokin sess
Locked up on a 187'll make any nigga stress
You can wear a vest, it won't stop two to the head
Shot you in your face and now your ass is better off dead
Talkin shit'll get you smoked quick
No need to save a hoe because they can't live without dick
So I focus on the mail, Celly Cel
Ain't no playa-hatin nigga, I got too much heat to sell
Fairy tales I never kick, it's gangsterism in my veins
I kicked it with the O.G.'s pickin up on game:
Get your money on, fuck a bitch and get ghost
And keep one in the chamber for them fools that play you close

And playa-hatas hate to see a nigga comin real

Down with the P.G., niggas don't want to see me
Act a fuckin fool, shootin up the city
Happy on the trigger like my nigga Frank Nitty
Let's get into the see thang, Hillside slang
It's a Hillside thang from the Hillside, mang
Smokin em like a chronic sack, rollin em in a zag
Hittin em with the funk and zippin em up in bodybags
Everywhere I go fools get to actin crazy
want to let they nuts hang, thinkin they can fade me
So I keep a life-long mug on my face
Rollin with some heat, sippin on a straight lace
A high speed chase, bank it in the side pocket
Po-po's can't fuck with the 350 rocket
Under my hood it's all good when I'm on the gas
Checkin the rollers and the jackers that try to blast
Tricks of the trade already made, gangster got it down
Never panic under pressure when it's goin down
Droppin a bomb, nigga, mobb beats 4 yo azz

Pimpin and and pandlin, hoe handlin the whole bit
Killers move in silence, nigga, I don't talk shit
I see them loudmouth niggas keep gettin dead
And the silent ones on 25 to life bids
You gotta pack some heat in the street, it's goin down
If you ain't down you better move to a square town
Niggas talk shit, drink and smoke weed up
Hit the county jail straight p.c.-ed up
You never know who really down till the funk jump
Same one that jump and the finger points at the punk
And your crew wasn't down from the get-go
Don't you know how that bitch-made nigga shit go?
Hollow points get to the point quicker
Cause talkin shit full of liquor thinkin that you're sicker
Than the next nigga'll get you full of bullet holes
Stayin on my toes and I just can't let go

Celly Cel,"Sittin on the shelf, they got me stuck up in this box
Choppin it up with the homies, havin visions of a glock 17
Niggas on my team can't wait to fill clip up
We jumpin out the barrel with my niggas, shootin shit up
See under niner ross, black talon, hollow tips flow
Aim me at the chest, I'm makin sure that vest don't get no love
Ain't even breathin, leave the body shittin like a seagull
See I'm illegal, I got pockets like that ? eagle
Fuckin around with me is danger, I'm talkin shit
Tryin to brainwash the trigger when I'm in the chamber
Don't give a fuck if it's a accident or on purpose
When I'm comin out the chamber, fool it's just inservice
Don't get nervous when you see what I do
I love to hit the target, and when I'm breakin that skin, ooh
Travel through his heart, ricochét off the nearest bone
Rip his insides up, shatter his spine, now I'm gone
Layin by the body, waitin for the FEDS
Swoop me up for evidence, then I'm just some melted led
It ain't no thang, got me back where I started
In a box, with my homies, waitin for my next target

Ha ha ha, the mothafuckin bullet
Shootin up shit everywhere
Every city in every state
Don't give a fuck about who when the bullet fly
The only thought that's on my mind is ""die nigga, die""
Ha ha ha

But what do ya know, looks like I'm 'bout to be purchased again
I seen a nigga ask for them black talons and grin
It won't be long 'til they let me loose
Got me in the clip, drinkin Gin with no fuckin juice
It's goin down, I know they ridin on some fools tonight
Hit the lights, squeeze the trigger, send me on my flight
Don't give a fuck about who I hit when I fly
The only thought that's on my mind is ""die nigga, die""
Women and children and babies, I know it's crazy
See I'm a bullet, it's my job, man that shit don't faze me
Even the hand that's on the trigger get shot too
Wherever the barrel aiming at, that's who I end up smokin fool
Don't get it twisted, I got no love for none of y'all
Got to dig a tunnel through your head, and watch the body fall
Just shoot and I'mma do the rest
I love givin young niggas cardiac arrests
Bullet-proof niggas, I go up in 'em quickly
The ambulance picked him up with shit all in his Dickies
Just cock the glock, put your finger on the trigger, pull it
And make a mothafucka feel the bullet

Ha ha ha, yeah
Another victim of these mothafuckin bullets
Once we pull the trigger, don't get nervous
'cause it's instant mothafuckin service
Ha ha ha, yeah
Breakin fools off every-mothafuckin-day
Ha ha ha

Up out the chamber, it's that sneaky mothafucka creepin
You heard a shot but didn't know until the blood was leakin
Up out your chest, you seen your flesh was a bloody mess
Dropped down on your knees, and ran outta breath
Sentanced to your death
Got hit by the wig splittin, shirt rippin, pistol wippin nigga
Catchin 'em slippin when they set trippin
Dippin and dabbin, you niggas know who I am, and
Can't be fuckin with them faulty heaters that be jammin
I love to fly and when they jam, I can't come out and kick it
Just pick a target, point me at it and see how quick I hit it
Droppin bodies by the dozens, in and out your cousins
I'm burnin niggas like a oven, givin up no lovin
? with my dogs, ridin in a 50 round clip
Ready to make the hit, talkin long shit, bitch
Hit the floor before I hit the door and split ya with some heat
Take your head and leave your body in the street
As I creep, up on my next mothafuckin victim
Sweep him off his feet, pull the trigger, let me sick him
Hit him high, hit him low, you know how it go
Put your finger on the trigger, pull it, the mothafuckin bullet

Ha ha ha, the mothafuckin bullet
Mobbin through your hood and takin head
Showin no mothafuckin remorse
We don't give a fuck about you
The bullet, ha ha ha
Sprayin up shit everywhere we go
Don't give a fuck, layin men 6 feet on the regular

Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthafucka 
Once again, you know 
'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all 
You know, nothin' but that realness 
Can ya feel this though 
Yeah.. Gonna ride wit ya nigga 'cause it's goin' down 

They say break yo'self or make yo'self 
So I said fuck it, bought a glock so I could take myself 
Through all this soft shit a nigga face as a youngsta 
Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster 
OG's hoopin' at the school house & shootin' dice 
In & out the pen, real niggas might ? nice 
Made this hog get the brew
Made me hit the weed 
Eatin' at the ho house 
Moms know a nigga kill 
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door 
Tellin' myself ""I ain't smokin' weed no more"" 
But you know 
Them lies as the days go by 
Me, Choo-Choo & Clyde smokin' dank 'til the sun rise 
Walk into the school house 
Franklin Junior 
Back when it was cool to kiss & tell and spread rumors 
Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle 
Sockin' mutha-fuckas 'til they eyes turn purple 
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1 
Fools throwin' thangs to the end 
Back then, it was fun 
No gunshots 
No need to hit the floor 
But after shool 
The whole city woken up 
Let's hit the park fool 
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game 
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs 
Chasin' 5 off for hot dogs & fries bitch 
But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit 

1 -     (Can't tell me shit) 
        Bitch made niggas can't tell a nigga shit

        (They can't tell a nigga shit) 
        Fuck you bitch - you can't tell a nigga shit 

Repeat 1

Got a little older, now the park is a joke 
'Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope 
Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip 
Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit 
So I mind my own, find my home 
Now I'm in the zone 
Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on 
Had 10 dollas & JB gave me the other 10 
Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind 
Brakes with the ???, ounces & QP's 
The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's 
Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go 
To Hogan Hoctors, it be bitches at the talent show 
And for all & hoop games had hoes 
Hilail & Hogie, you know it was on fo' sho' 
Reece assists & Redge with the Tamahawk ? up 
Then the whole town, mobbin' down to the waterfront 
Niggas in Granadas, Cougars & Mustangs 
Stars & Volvos 
Nobody fuckin' with them ? thangs 
Me, G-Roc, JB & Lil' see-Mo 
Puffin' on indo 
Splittin' 4 double O Z's 
Young G's tryin' to live 
And when they shut the ship door, we goin' under the bridge 
Gettin' whip-lash from the brake gas mash and dip 
'Cause back then, you couldn't tell a nigga shit 

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Made it to a G, but ain't no love in my city 
Now we set trippin', all these fools actin' shitty 
Niggas want to reel me in, but didn't know 
When you fuckin' wit the big fish, you fuckin' wit a funeral 
No more toe to toe 
HK-44's 
Now what they know about the mutha fuckin' murda shows 
Strap on my right hand side, in the Bay area 
Shit is gettin' scarier 
Niggas are ??? 
Fuck the bird, I'm the nigga bailin' ? early 
Trigga happy nigga wit a head fulla Shirlies, on 
Christian brothas in ??? 
Or drinkin' hurricanes wit my niggas in da click 
So deep, I can't call it 
Spend about a million dollas at the liquor store 
I'm just an alcoholic 
40, Water & Legit put me on the map 
Got my foot in the door, now I'm givin' up dank 
Sick wit his last job, my 9 to 5 
The shit I used to dream about is how I survive 
Lifestyle of a mack 
Funk for life 
Some Heat 4 Yo' Azz 
Them Killa Kali niggas blast and smash 
Without a murda weapon or a witness 
Too many niggas in yo' car, risky business 
They turn snitches

Good evening
Welcome to channel 187 Murder 1 News
Tonight we focus on the city of Vallejo in the state of California
Where five black men were found dead at the water front
From various gunshot wounds
This brings the homicide rate in the state of California to one of the
highest in the nation
And is now known to you as killa kali

(Verse 1)
The state of California niggas call it killa kali
Murder weapons in the river bodies found in the alleys
Bring the yellow tape
Body bags gettin zipped up
Heads blown off wit they insides ripped up
Mobile phones flipped up
Factors callin shots
Bitch made niggas its some real niggas on the block
Cause every hood got a trigga happy nigga
That don't give a fuck about puttin two in your liver
But how you figure you can do dirt and stay clean
Niggas like that get pronounced dead on the scene
ain't no winnin teams cause everybody taken losses in they hood
Reminiscin on they niggas man I wish I could
Bring back the homies that I lost up in that funk season
Gotta check myself or let that alcohol be the reason
So I just poor a little liquor on the concrete
For my dead homies and the ones who ain't gone see the streets
Locked up with the rest of the locs
But whatever the reason my folks are walkin the yard
Or gettin they guts some
Tryin to make it home but I think they
Safer in that pin cause niggas on gin be lettin them Mack 10's
Bust 32 times
And niggas who ain't in it gettin shot by
Standards on the block
Smokin like bomb
Fools given up they cell
Gettin sideways leaven them t-shirts soakin wet
Retaliation is a must
So now you know them niggas you was funkin wit
Gone be at yo do so
Keep yo hand on yo nina in the valley
Or get dumped in the alley
Fuckin around in killa kali

(Chorus 1)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)

(Chorus 2)
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buddahba
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buck buck
It's killa kali It's killa kali
budduhba
It's killa kali It's killa kali
buck buck

(Verse 2)
The killins on
ain't even safe when you at home
Whatever dirt you do
gone follow you until you gone
So pack ya chrome
And handle your own cause potnas tend to run
Walked in the party 10 deep and only left wit one
Real nigga on your team
But you know how it is
Can't even trust them niggas that you knew since you was kids
It ain't no thang
I let them niggas have it to
Bitch up and I switch up on that ass before I blast you
And fools better watch them hoes in they mix
Seen them chosen and you bid on that set up for a six
foot ditch with your family in front of you
So many niggas slip
That's how they slide a bitch up under you
I wonder whose the next nigga
To catch a bullet for sex nigga
Thought you was cock until they chopped you with them tecs nigga
I think the game is on its last leg
Trigga happy niggas wit no heart
It ain't no used to be
For your life
cause out here they quick to take they own
Snortin that Peruvian
On Hennessey you know they gone
can't tell a nigga shit in the 9-5
All about they scrilla doin niggas in on the side
Bellin through yo hood buckin fools down
Gettin caught slippin with they mutherfuckin pants down
Sleep with one eye open in the valley
cause everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

(Chorus 1)

(Chorus 2)

(Verse 3)
California niggas be plottin on fools
Jackin mutherfuckers for them daytons
And leave that ol' school
Sittin on with yo face in the dash
two in the back of yo head
Rip yo pockets of then laugh
Then you got them fools on the track pullin out glocks
Pistol whippin niggas till they drop
Reach in they draws and take they rocks
They money
They rings and they chains
Without a skimask on
But can't complain
Its all in the game
Follow one of them ballers to  they residence
tyin niggas up
Lookin for them dead presidents
Its for the money
You know the scratch but now we call it scrilla
It turned them kali niggas into straight killas
Set trippin on a daily basis
Vietnam ain't shit on what a nigga in the hood faces
1-8-7 case
Cop into a lesser charge
Three strikes
Hit you with that L
Lock behind bars
Bellin wit a strap
Punks seem like its waitin
To catch a nigga slippin or get killed over conversation
Fuckin wit bitch will get you killed quick
Niggas let they hoes mow down they homies on the real beitch
Fools come to kali thinkin club med
Caught up in the cross fire when them sets bump heads
Keep yo hand on ya nina in the valley
Or everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

(Chorus 1)",Killa Kali,1995

Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthafucka 
Once again, you know 
'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all 
You know, nothin' but that realness 
Can ya feel this though 
Yeah.. Gonna ride wit ya nigga cuz it's goin' down 

They say break yo'self or make yo'self 
So I said fuck it, bought a glock so I could take myself 
Through all this soft shit a nigga face as a youngsta 
Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster 
OG's hoopin' at the school house & shootin' dice 
In & out the pen, real niggas might ? nice 
Made this hog get the brew
Made me hit the weed 
Eatin' at the ho house 
Moms know a nigga kill 
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door 
Tellin' myself ""I ain't smokin' weed no more"" 
But you know 
Them lies as the days go by 
Me, Choo-Choo & Clyde smokin' dank 'til the sun rise 
Walk into the school house 
Franklin Junior 
Back when it was cool to kiss & tell and spread rumors 
Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle 
Sockin' mutha-fuckas 'til they eyes turn purple 
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1 
Fools throwin' thangs to the end 
Back then, it was fun 
No gunshots 
No need to hit the floor 
But after shool 
The whole city woken up 
Let's hit the park fool 
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game 
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs 
Chasin' 5 off for hot dogs & fries bitch 
But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit

'Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope 
Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip 
Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit 
So I mind my own, find my home 
Now I'm in the zone 
Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on 
Had 10 dollas & JB gave me the other 10 
Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind 
Brakes with the ???, ounces & QP's 
The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's 
Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go 
To Hogan Hoctors, it be bitches at the talent show 
And for all & hoop games had hoes 
Hilail & Hogie, you know it was on fo' sho' 
Reece assists & Redge with the Tamahawk ? up 
Then the whole town, mobbin' down to the waterfront 
Niggas in Granadas, Cougars & Mustangs 
Stars & Volvos 
Nobody fuckin' with them ? thangs 
Me, G-Roc, JB & Lil' C-Mo 
Puffin' on indo 
Splittin' 4 double O Z's

Gettin' whip-lash from the brake gas mash and dip

When you fuckin' wit the big fish, you fuckin' wit a funeral 
No more toe to toe 
HK-44's 
Now what they know about the mutha fuckin' murda shows 
Strap on my right hand side, in the Bay area 
Shit is gettin' scarier 
Niggas are ??? 
Fuck the bird, I'm the nigga bailin' ? early 
Trigga happy nigga wit a head fulla Shirlies, on 
Christian brothas in ??? 
Or drinkin' hurricanes wit my niggas in da click 
So deep, I can't call it 
Spend about a million dollas at the liquor store 
I'm just an alcoholic 
40, Water & Legit put me on the map 
Got my foot in the door, now I'm givin' up dank 
Sick wit his last job, my 9 to 5 
The shit I used to dream about is how I survive 
Lifestyle of a mack 
Funk for life 
Some Heat 4 Yo' Azz 
Them Killa Kali niggas blast and smash 
Without a murda weapon or a witness 
Too many niggas in yo' car, risky business 
They turn snitches 
Break down & have the po-po's at yo' front door 
And all real niggas know 
Who rides sucka-free, on the solo

And bust a right Coney Island pop the trunk and started capping

Head you better off dead than to fuck around with psycho niggas
Don't be trying to plead yo case cuz I don't even like no niggas
In my face, trying to question me about some drama
Only answer to two people: God and my mama
Far as niggas trying to put me in the cross,
Let em holler at my bitch, Nina Ross hoe house boss
I bet you mind something in, run and tell a friend
? on the Gin, I think he said ""trippin"" once again
It ain't no stopping me, get at me then I'm dumping on ya,
Riding past yo funeral hanging out the window slumping on ya
You didn't know, they didn't tell you boy you better listen
While I shoot this shit before you put yourself in that position
Niggas that know me know I specialize in having bump
You can have the tail way from the shovel so we can pop the trunk

Ain't got no time for middle men and small fries,
Only money conversation and big thighs,
Let me talk to your boss man, the nigga wit the pies,
And back yo ass up and don't act so surprised,
When pistols start to cock, hands start to rise,
Nobody move too fast I advise,
Or you can catch a hot one right between ya eyes,
Recognize I done set me sights on the prize,
And put lights out with boom fifty bye, bye's,
I'm labeling my life off of rap and weed highs,
And ask my agent bout my fucking shoe size.,
But fucking wit us ain't wise,

Running off at they dick suckers gettin it crunk

Creeping up on me when I had one hand on the wheel
One hand on the steel, trying to break a nigga's thinking
Ride with shoot, sharpening skills for season whatever the reason

Crying to Mama; I kicking the door to alleviate the whole situation
Fuck with me, he ended up having his whole family erased
Face it, no charges, leaving the body until you better respect game
Fuck that, when niggas spill fuck your hood
When your caught up in a twist flash on us, you'll end up sleeping

Hit the scenes with machines if you want my team
There ain't no in-between seventeen in that place

I pull a blunt from my lit forty-five from my hip and spit
Incredible, medical hardcore; the deadliest metaliest
Gas ever set off in a war; westcoast, the spot where
We making millin dollar noise; survival in heck-packing heat
Ducking from them, I'm just a thug nigga, step on your street
And draw my heat then I plug niggas I be a G
From the G.B.C., I mug niggas; don't flag, I just sag
And carry a mag and get off in the snitches' asses
