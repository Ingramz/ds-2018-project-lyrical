Antonio Serrano,"Esta tarde vi llover 
Vi gente correr 
Y no estabas tu 
La otra noche vi brillar 
Un lucero azul 
Y no estabas tu 

La otra tarde vi 
Que un ave enamorada 
Daba besos a su amor ilusionada 
Y no estabas tu 

Esta tarde vi llover 
Vi gente correr 
Y no estabas tu 

El otoño vi llegar 
Al mar oí cantar 
Y no estabas tu 

Ya no se cuanto me quieres 
Si me extrañas o me engañas 
Solo se que vi llover 
Vi gente correr 
Y no estabas tu",Esta Tarde Ví Llover,2001
Antonio Sol,"Ay de mí, llorona
Llorona de azul celeste
Ay de mí, llorona, llorona
Llorona de azul celeste
Y aunque la vida me cuesta llorona
No dejare de quererte

Me subí al pino más alto, llorona, a ver si te divisaba
Me subí al pino más alto, llorona, a ver si te divisaba
Como el pino era tierno, llorona, al verme llorar, lloraba
Como el pino era tierno, llorona, al verme llorar, lloraba

La pena y la que no es pena, llorona, todo es pena para mí
La pena y la que no es pena, llorona, todo es pena para mí
Ayer lloraba por verte, llorona, hoy lloro porque te vi
Ayer lloraba por verte, llorona, hoy lloro porque te vi

Ay, de mí, llorona, llorona de azul celeste
Ay, de mí, llorona, llorona de azul celeste
Y aunque la vida me cueste, llorona, no dejaré de quererte
Y aunque la vida me cueste, llorona, no dejaré de quererte
No dejaré de quererte
No dejaré de quererte
Ay, ay, ay",La  Llorona,2017
Antonio Sol,"I have to sing, I have to play
The music, it's, it's not just in me, it is me
When life gets me down, I play my guitar
The rest of the world may follow the rules, but I must follow my heart
You know that feeling? Like there's a song in the air and it's playing just for you?

The feeling's so close you can reach out and touch it
I never knew I could want something so much but it's true

""You must have faith sister""

""Oh but Padre, he will never listen""

""He will listen to music""

Only a song, only a song, has the power to change a heart

""Never underestimate the power of music""

""But my father, he will never give me permission""

""I am done asking permission
When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by, you must seize it""

""Señor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment?""

""I've had to have faith in my dream
No one was going to hand it to me, it was up to me reach for that dream, grab it tight""

""And make it come true""",Much Needed Advice,2017
Antonio Sol,"Señoras y señores
Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Señoritas y señores
To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy, que alegria
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia

For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia
For this music is my language",The World Es Mi Familia,2017
Antonio Tarrago Ros,"Sentado solo en un banco en la ciudad
Con tu mirada recordando el litoral
Tu suerte quiso estar partida, mitad verdad, mitad mentira
Como esperanza de los pobres prometida

Andando solo bajo la llovizna gris
Fingiendo duro que tu vida fue de aquí
¿Porque cambiaste un mar de gente por donde gobierna la flor?
Mira que al río nunca le falto el color

Carito suelta tu pena
Se haga diamante tu lagrima entre mis cuerdas
Carito suelta tu piedra
Para volar como el zorzal en primavera

En Buenos Aires los zapatos son modernos
Pero no lucen como en la plaza de un pueblo
Deja que tu luz, chiquitita, le hable en secreto a la canción
Para que te ilumine un poco mas el sol

Cualquier semilla cuando es planta quiere ver la
Misma estrella de aquel atardecer
Que la salvo del pico agudo, refugiándola en lo oscuro
De la gaviota arrasadora de los surcos

Carito yo soy tu amigo
Me ofrezco árbol para tu nido
Carito suelta tu canto que el abanico
En mi acordeón lo esta esperando

",Canción Para Carito,
Antonio Tarrago Ros,"Mirar rasgado, patitas chuecas
María va pisando penas, la arena ardiente
María va calcina el monte un sol de fuego
María va temor pombero, palmar estero
María va

Quiso la siesta ponerle un niño a su soledad
De trigo y luna y de su mano
María va por el tabacal, tu paso
María va y se bebe el sol que huele a duende
María va

Andando el verano de sol y chicharra
A flores del monte, María, olía tu pueblo
Un tren perezoso, resuello y resuello

A calle regada, María, olía tu pueblo
A pura inocencia de niño pueblero
A calle regada, a flores del monte
María, olía tu pueblo

Mirar rasgado, patitas chuecas
María va pisando penas, la arena ardiente
María va calcina el monte un sol de fuego
María va temor pombero, palmar estero
María va

Quiso la siesta ponerle un niño a su soledad
De trigo y luna y de su mano
María va por el tabacal, tu paso
María va y se bebe el sol que huele a duende
María va, María va, María va, María va, María va

Antonio Vega,"Donde nos llevó la imaginación 
Donde con los ojos cerrados

Antonio Vega,"Soy un completo incompleto
incompleto por amor
la costilla que me falta

menor y desafinado

António Zambujo,"Não sei, não sabe ninguém
Porque canto fado, neste tom magoado
De dor e de pranto
E neste momento, todo sofrimento
Eu sinto que a alma cá dentro se acalma
Nos versos que canto
Foi Deus, que deu luz aos olhos
Perfumou as rosas, deu ouro ao sol e prata ao luar
Foi Deus que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas que vou desfiando e choro a cantar
E pôs as estrelas no céu
E fez o espaço sem fim
Deu luto as andorinhas
Ai deu-me esta voz a mim

Se canto, não sei porque canto
Misto de ternura, saudade, ventura e talvez de amor
Mas sei que cantando
Sinto o mesmo quando, se tem um desgosto
E o pranto no rosto nos deixa melhor
Foi Deus, que deu voz ao vento
Luz ao firmamento
E deu o azul nas ondas do mar
Ai foi Deus, que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas que vou desfiando e choro a cantar
Fez o poeta o rouxinol
Pôs no campo o alecrim
Deu flores à primavera ai
E deu-me esta voz a mim
Deu flores à primavera ai
E deu-me esta voz a mim",Foi Deus [It Was God],2008
António Zambujo,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar

Recorda-te de Acapulco, daquelas noites
Maria Bonita, Maria querida!
Na praia deserta e escura, tua brancura 
Era uma estrela do céu caída 
Teu corpo que o mar beijava, lançando as ondas 
Para alcançá-lo, não alcançava!
Confesso que ao contemplá-lo, 
Confesso com sentimento, meu pensamento, ai, me atraiçoava! 
Eu disse muitas palavras dessas que a gente 
Diz docemente em seus anseios 
Pedindo que me atendesses, que convertesses 
Em realidade, meus devaneios!
A lua que nos olhava foi-se escondendo discretamente na noite calma.
Eu, reconhecidamente, cheguei-me para beijar-te e, 
E em beijos, dar-te, ai, toda minha'alma!
Amores sei que tivestes muitos amores,Maria Bonita, Maria querida!
Porém, nenhum tão honrado, tão branco e puro 
Como o que eu juro por minha vida 
Que trago cheio de flores para ofertar-te, 
Para adorar-te de alma ajoelhada! Recebe-o emocionada 
E jura que não mentes porque te sentes, ai, idolatrada!

De manhã cedinho eu salto do ninho
E vou pra paragem
De bandolete à espera do 7 mas não pela viagem
Eu bem que não queria
Mas um certo dia eu vi-o passar
E o meu peito séptico, por um pica de elétrico
Voltou a sonhar

A cada repique, que soa do clique
Daquele alicate
Num modo frenético, o peito séptico toca a rebate
Se o trem descarrila o povo refila
E eu fico num sino
Pois um mero trajeto no meu caso concreto
É já o destino

Ninguém acredita no estado em que fica
O meu coração
Quando o 7 me apanha
Até acho que a senha me salta da mão
Pois na carreira desta vida vã
Mais nada me dá a pica que o pica do sete me dá

Que triste fadário e que itinerário tão infeliz
Cruzar meu horário
Com o dum funcionário de um trem da carris
Se eu lhe perguntasse
Se tem livre passe pró peito de alguém
Vá-se lá saber
Talvez eu lhe oblitere o peito também

Ninguém acredita no estado em que fica
O meu coração
Quando o 7 me apanha

Antony,"In youth's spring, it was my lot
To haunt of the wide earth a spot
To which I could not love the less;
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound.
And the tall trees that tower'd around.
But when the night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot-- as upon all,
And the wind would pass me by
In its stilly melody,
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake.
Yet that terror was not fright--
But a tremulous delight,
And a feeling undefined,
Springing from a darkened mind.
Death was in that poisoned wave
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his dark imagining;
Whose wildering though could even make
An Eden of that dim lake.",The Lake,2004

Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again
Kiss your dreams goodbye

All the sad young men
Sitting in the bars
Knowing neon lights
Missing all the stars

All the sad young men
They’re waiting in the cold
Trying to forget
That they're growing old

All the sad young men
Choking on their youth
Trying to be brave
Running from the truth

Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part

All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold
Someone to love them for just a little while

Tired little girl
Does the best
She does the best that she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man

While grimy moon
Watches from above
All the sad young men
Why they play making love, making love, making love

Misbegotten moon
Shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light
Guide them home again
All the sad young men

And at the very end I'd read it all again

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo

Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day

Kuka vastaa, keneltä kysyisin?
Milloin perille pääsisin?
Minne teen kodin
Sieltä en tahtoisi en takaisin

Tahdon askeleistani jättää jälkiä
Enemmän ehtiä nauraa kuin itkeä
Ja sitoa yhteen niitä onnen nauhoja
Pidemmäksi kuin osiensa summa

Antwon Lamar Robinson,"Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 

First it was nothin', not even, a fake ? 
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along 
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes 
Thought I'd never feel this way again 
And you were supposed to reach my heart 
And find love within, love, love 
Oooh...oooh 

Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love 
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me 
Wonderful 

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near 
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared 
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend 
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again 

Fall in love again, in a storm 
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses) 

Just when I thought I'd seen it all 
Our paths crossed, amen 
And I knew, from the first glance 
That you, would be hard to forget 
Your eyes, attracted me first 
But you reeked of sultry confidence 
I couldn't wait, to touch lips 
And kiss, with my heart's intention 
When we didn't, was what I expected 
And for that moment, we erased the tension 
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters 
And the initial blind date, first impressions 
We kissed again; and I felt the passion 
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin' 

We made love, within a storm 
In the midst of passion and chaos 
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost 
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder 
Those who prevail this drama 
Will learn to bring their love farther 
But now, the storm has past 
And the seas of our friendship are gone 
But as long as I live, I will remember 
The love within a storm 

(Love within a storm is repeated after every line) 
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love 
Ya know that I miss you, and love you 
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart 
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice 
They say, this ghetto fabulous 
On 125th street forkin' around 
This village, and the village uptown 
South Central, Compton, Philly 
Sha-Town, Southside 
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta 
Jersey peeps, I hear ya

Ya know, I got love for you",Thug Blues,2000

You want me to know that you're mine, mine

We both had a broken heart when we met up
Your body a piece of art, you don't sell it

You know that I miss it, I just wanna kiss it
I scroll through the phone, lookin' how we would kick it (kick it)
Knock at the door, it's a visit

Sin los condones y con la glopeta, 35,000 en mi roleta
Bebecita, yo me vengo cuando tú grita
Y tú te viene cuando tu totito te palpita

Pensando en ti, pensando en mi
Yo adentro 'e tu cuerpo
Tú encima 'e mí, yo adentro e' ti
Tú ere' un oasis en el desierto

Tú me tienes viviendo de los recuerdos
Y ese cuellito yo te lo muerdo, uh, yeh
Yo quiero comerte, uah
Hasta la muerte, uah

Pensando en ti, pensando en mi
Yo perdí'o en tu silueta
Tú encima 'e mí, yo encima 'e ti
Devorándote completa

Pensando en ti, pensando en mí
Tú mojándote en mi cama inquieta
Yo encima 'e ti, yo adentro 'e ti
Mientra' tú gritas y me aprieta'

Baby no disimules que tú te pones nerviosa cuando llegamo'
Canciones como esta a muchos le dan alegría, a otros le dan dolor de barriga

Extrañando tu pelo de oro y tus ojos de cobre

Que es el amor sin la felicidad y sin el dolor?
Se sufre y se ríe, pero que rico el calor
Tu encima de mí, vulnerable y yo haciéndote el amor
Mami tu me matas y yo me entierro adentro de ti
Tan rica que no me canso de amarte a ti
Tocándonos por el teléfono, vente pa’ mí
Viniéndonos a la vez bien rico hasta que salí
Baby, hablándome al oído bien sexy, baby
Yo nunca pude olvidarme de ti

Break not ye breezes, your chains of repose
While murmuring mournfully Lir's lonely daughter
Tells to the night star her tale of woes

When shall the swan, her death note ringing
Sleep with the wings in darkness furled?
When will heav'n, its sweet bell ringing
Call my spirit from this stormy world?

Sadly, oh Moyle, to thy winter wave weeping
Fate bids me languish long ages away
Yet still in her darkness doth Erin lie sleeping
Still doth the pure light its dawning delay

When will the day star mildly springing
Warm our isle with peace and love?
When will heav'n, its sweet bell ringing
Call my spirit to the fields above?
Call my spirit to the fields above?","Silent, O Moyle",1995

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree
I will arise and go now
And a small cabin built there, of clay and wattles made
I will arise and go now
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee
I will arise and go now
And live alone in the bee-loud glade

And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings
There midnight's all a-glimmer
And noon, a purple glow
And evening full of linnet's wings

I will arise
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I will arise and go now
I hear lake water lapping
With low sounds by the shore
I will arise and go now
While I stand on the roadway or on the pavements gray
I hear it in the deep, in the deep heart's core
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree",Innisfree,1996

And my love is like sloe-blossom on the blackthorn

So many men reach for the highest branch
To find the bitter fruit, to find the bitter fruit
Close within reach of the hand lies the sweetest berry
On the lowest branch, on the lowest branch

Snow falls on the mountain of Sliabh Uí Fhloinn
And my love is like sloe-blossom on the blackthorn",Blackthorn,1997
Anúna,"Lyrics:

I once had a sweetheart but now I have none
He's gone and he's left me in sorrow to weep and mourn
He's gone and he's left me for others to see
I know that he'll soon find another far better than me

I wrote him a letter both loving and kind
He wrote me an answer with sharp twisted lines
Saying, ""Keep your love letters, and I will keep mine
You write to your love, and I'll write to mine""

Chorus:
Green grows the laurel, soft falls the dew
Hard was my heart when I parted from you
In our next meeting I hope you'll prove true
And we'll join the green laurel for the violet so blue

He passes my window both early and late
The looks that he gives me would make my heart break
The looks that he gives me a thousand would kill
Whenever he wanders, he'll be my love still

(Chorus 2x)

For the violet so blue, for the violet so blue",The Green Laurel,1998
Anúna,"If on every ocean the ship is a throne 
And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue

Bringing on disguise of night
Turn the whole kaleidoscope

As the lights that frighten fade
'Til the dawn drags into view
I'm lost in deep dead blue

Deep dead blue I'd rather stay
Far from the cruel colored day
Leave me in my monochrome
'Til I find a finer hue
Beyond the deep dead blue",Deep Dead Blue,1998
Anúna,"Never give all the heart
For love will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seems certain

Never give all the heart
For love will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seems certain
And they never dream that it fades out from kiss to kiss
For everything that's lovely is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight
O never give the heart outright

For they, for all smooth lips can say
Have given their hearts up to the play
And who could play it well enough
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?
He that made this knows all the cost
For he gave all his heart and lost

They, for all smooth lips can say
Have given their hearts up to the play
Never give all the heart",Never Give All the Heart,1999

I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion

Dancing, dancing to put thy pale, lost lilies out of my mind
And I was desolate and sick of an old passion
Yea, all the time because the dance was long
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion

There falls thy shadow, Cynara, the night is thine

Will touch our world again

Where the wild song echoes, echoes in my heart

And the violet is too pale a hue

That's not the flower for me
For then I'll pluck the red rose off
And plant a willow tree

And the willow tree shall weep
And the willow tree shall whine

We'll have their heads and female slaves

Riding hard they rushed the gates
And scaled the granite walls
Through boiling oil and falling stone

Are in permanent retirement

Stay on track - with no regret, I won't forget

From riding skates, to riding 24's 
From off the block hustlin' to rockin' shows 
We done seen many bumps in the road 
But still we remain, still in the game 
Never worry , about them haters, that will never change 
And I put this on everything babe 
I am my brother's keeper. 

Listen D-roc, I know you don't think I care for ya, 
But at a drop of a dime I'll be there for ya, 
And anybody want to see us apart we need to get rid of
They ass man and that's from the heart. 
Pick em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends, 
We seem to have plenty of friends. excuse me then friend,
Let me borrow a stack and when tomorrow comes don't ask me to borrow it back. 
If they can't do that they don't contribute to the answer ? from the ?
Serious as cancer. If I was jojo dancer I would do the same thang, 
Not to let another man spark my flame. D-roc is the ying, 
Kain is the yang but without
The both of us we ain't got a damn thang.

And my brother we done been through a lot but still kain I love ya.

The time you make me laugh you made me mad.

When we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack, scraping up
Change trying to make 2 dollars or 3 to get 
Some 99 cent hamburgers to eat 
And then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car. 
Back then we was some
Underground superstars and these last 5 years we done put work in, 
Now the whole world know of the ying yang twins. 
Even though we don't spend time at home
Together, we hit the road and its like we never left each other. 
Now that's love,
I love you til the day that I leave so its still my brother and me.

And stay away from the con and mind games.

To make a line between stress and peace 
And satan always gettin the best of me,

Helping yo sister, mama, daddy, children and all.

Don't know what's going on. THey don't know right from wrong,

Les stars ça décline, un jour on les remplace
Les foules sont anonymes, et un jour on les embrasse
La pression domine, personne n'est à ma place
J'ai pas de pseudonyme, Youssoupha c'est mon vrai blaze
J'ai un label qui monte, tant pis pour la critique
Et puis plaire à tout le monde, c'est plaire à n'importe qui
Le but de ma musique, du rap que j'expose
C'était de rester authentique, pas de rester pauvre
Et la France m'a fliqué, ses apparences nous mentent
Mon bled me fait flipper, ma famille me manque
L'amour m'a fait chialer pour tout ce que j'éprouve
Mais la haine m'a installé des yeux waterproofs
Prouve que tu luttes, prouve que t'exultes
Prouve que le but c'est briser les cœurs bruts
Ils veulent qu'on se buttent, attendent les erreurs que l'on commet
On se ressemble, appelle moi Youss', on se connaît!

Tant d'années, tant d'années, Youss' on se connaît

À tant vouloir m'exiler ailleurs
Et prier pour le meilleur
Je réalise que les mêmes rêves
Nous font et nous rassemblent
Il y a de l'amour dans mes paroles
Tu chantes avec moi et je m'envole
Tu te retrouves en moi
Je sais qu'on se ressemble
Tu bouges la tête sur la musique
Le temps s'arrête et c'est magique!
C'est là toute l'histoire de ma vie
Et tu la connais, on se connaît
Un autre pas vers l'avenir
Je t'invite encore à me suivre
On se connaît
Et je sais qu'on se ressemble

He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two

Or the cynical moon?
Could it be the neighbor's cat watching
Me from the living room?

Either way, these days I feel so strange.
I remember you, so strange.
Do you remember me secretly?

So I comb the depths of the ocean floor
Of my memory, grasping onto some
Shell, some piece some evidence

Sunlight streams in morning
Your head in the sheets
Dancing naked in the living room
(I still practice secretly).

I remember you secretly.
Do you remember me secretly?

Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing 
And they don't see it showing, why do I? 
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face 
And show the world all the love in your heart 
The people gonna treat you better 
You're gonna find, yes you will 
That you're beautiful as you feel 
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness 
In a world where tears are just a lullaby 
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness 
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try 
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face 
And show the world all the love in your heart

Of Annabelle's and Lilian's
Would be, to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that I'm attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a lovely cottage that, do you wanna meet Monday to pick up the forniture

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Anybody Killa,"A motherfucker recognize a thug mashin' hard
Straight out the plot of my cemetery yard
Buried so long, nobody gave a shit
Blood and tears, embedded in my casket
Been surrounded, old folks everywhere
Smell of dry piss covered the air
When I heard the voices say arise from the grave
I quickly dug myself out and went to find the 12-gauge
Shotgun, double barrelled sawed off pump
Safety runs through the target if you test me
Psycho thug, mashin' outta control
Spent too many fuckin' years deep in a hole
But still I'm a killa, feindin' for the streets
Slangin' rocks on a 9 to 5 beat
All that change, now got maggots on my face
I'm back from the dead to give yo ass a taste 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 

The grave ain't no place to be
Too much like the penetentary
Locked away in concrete
I'm buried 6 feet
Guess so, so when you roam
You can find your way home
Cuffs tight around the wrist cause I was bustin' my chrome
Dark visions in the smog when I walk with the dead
Bad dreams in the night keep you shakin' in bed
Is it all in your head cause you're locked in a cage?
And clear your mind and get shanked and live the cemetery way 

I'm sittin' in the cemetery
I got a plan to kill a pig so I placed a phony call about a bitch I buried
Fuck a cell, I won't ever go back
I got you creasin' in my pocket like a folded up rap
I look in the back, a squad car pullin' up slow
I grabbed the pistol in the hand with the glove, and let it blow
Dashin' off like a thief in the night
To me it was right
I had to end his muthafuckin' life 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 

They can't keep a dead body locked down
In the ground
Of the pen
Came through the dirt, break free again
Leave my home of the grave, shared with the roaches
Back on the street, keep an eye on the vultures
Flip, my escape out the front gates
When the pigs check yo' friends, ain't no trace
Of a gangsta, I'm already out robbin' suckers
Pistol whippin' bitches, puttin' holes in motherfuckers
Act like you know, Psychopathic on the glock
And I gives no fuck when I'm mashin' up ya block
Empty out the chamber, so long to your family
Everybody history
Nothing left but memories
Friends start to cry and you're one with the earth
Ain't nobody cry for me, not even the church
My rebirth was greeted my a police chase
But I'm a thug motherfucker, I ain't catchin' a case

the daily. WORLD WIDE BABY!! But for this moment in time, we want to give up 
props to D-Town (DETROIT!!!)

Straight outta Detroit, crazy mothafucka named Blaze
Back from the dead, tell my story on the front page
When I'm jackin'
I got a Mack-10
Squeeze the trigger off for criminals and axes
Which want to y'alls want to fuck with me?
The police are gonna have to come and get me
We stompin' yo ass, bitch I ain't goin' out
All you suckas, ain't nobody showin' out
Niggas want to set trip
Try and talk shit
Cold cock yo' ass and leave you with yo' wigsplit
Goin' off on any bitch like that
With a gat
That's pointed at yo' dome!
So give it up sucka
I'm down with Anybody, ""Drive-By, muthafucka!!""
He's a murderer, best keep yo' distance
Down with the Family, like Charles Manson
Crook throwaway is a mothafuckin' tool
Don't make me act a mothafuckin' fool
Me and you can go, toe to toe, maybe
On the corner, strapped, slangin' rocks daily
And turned weekly, monthly, and yearly
All the thugs in the hood represent me
'cause I'm down with a capital D-E-T
Bitch, you can't fuck with me!
When I'm in yo' neighborhood, you better duck
Ya Dead Homie, still crazy as fuck
Mashin' on you bitches, I think you get the point
Eastside, mothafucka, comin' straight outta Detroit

""Yo, Anybody, tell em' where you from!""
Straight outta Detroit, the name is Anybody Killa
Every bitch I choke, yo, my rep gets bigga
I'm a thug muthafucka, and you know this
But you playa hatin' bitches better never ever show this
I don't give a fuck, I make my cheese
Middle finger in the air screamin' ""Fuck the police!""
Straight servin', we call a cop car, jack it
Run your donuts, your guns, and your badges
Shoot a muthafucka in a minute
For some hood rat pussy and go up in it
So if you at a show
In the front row
I'ma call you a bitch if yo' ass ain't a juggalo
Bitches gettin' mad, bitches ain't shit
Bitches and hoes can eat a muthafuckin' dick
I'm a crazy muthafucka from the streets
With them thug ass lyrics and them thug ass beats
Anybody controls the automatic
So any punk muthafucka that start static
With my dead homie, or by myself
Everytime, I pull the AK off the shelf
Security is maximum and that's a law
K-I-double-L-A, I'm raw
Bitch, I'm a muthafuckin' villan
Stand in my way and you're witnessin' the killin'
Creepin' up without a clue
And once you in the scope, yo' ass is through
So bitch, you better get a grip
'cause Anybody Killa's on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Detroit!

""J is his name and the boy's comin'...""
Straight outta Detroit!
Is it nut that I'm cut
Like whut?
And make your sister eat butt
Dangerous
A thug claimin' Southwest
I'll leave an axe hangin' outta yo' chest
See I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a muthafuckin' cop, I'ma stop him
Play it smart and ask for directions
And then shank him in the fuckin' midsection
To me, it's kinda funny, this Prozac
I don't know where the fuck I'm goin' or where the fuck I'm at
I'm just rollin', lookin' for some ecstasy
So I can get high and fuck this bitch next to me
Ruthless...is the label that's floppin'
But the hatchetman be choppin'
'cause it really don't matter bout me
It's all Anybody Killa and Blaze Ya Dead Homie
Feel a little gust of wind and you're dead
'cause an axe just severed yo' head
And what about the bitch that got shot?
She gave me herpes so I shot her in the back
This be an autobiography
Of Blaze, he's dead and gone, but ain't lonely
Dark Lotus will slaughter your mother
And slap your brother

Now if you got yo hat tilted to that side
And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset
Then you might be.. gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be..

Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held

Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be..
Gang related! in and out tha penitentiary
With no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree

Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets
Then you might be..
Gang related! (aint nothin' wrong)

Do you wear a hatchetman?
You in a gang and yo ass better be ready to do that thang
You rep tha jrb and you will never switch

Did you beat your girlfriends who dissed your boys
Did your crew's name originate in illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like violent j

[Anybody killa]
I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free

Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

[Chorus: x 4]

[Violent j]
Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?
If you do that's okay, fuck we all do
I'm only tryin' to say you gang related too bitch!

Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio

I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery

The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'Cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

Ha ha

I jumped out of my bed thinking I'd been invaded, heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated 
Looked out of my window, blood dripped down thy glass, I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass, 
I ran into thy main room and Shaggy was dead, so was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady and ABK 
Bolted out of thy house to see if it's a joke, I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke 
And thy sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin' it's raining with corpses thy blood is appalling

IT POURS, but never mentioned Dead Bodies,
DEAD BODIES

Horrified looks on people's faces
(Thy blood is appalling) 
I hope I never see what all them people saw
And put them in there places
(Thy blood is appalling), 
The sun was so hot, 
So hot
I was burning,
Yeah 

Dead bodies lay randomly some stack in piles, on all of there faces pour horror, no smiles 
I see children, and ciders, and ninjas my age, all lay naked and mangled, most withered for days, 
I found safety a shelter I'm under a tree; only fingers and organs come falling on me, 
I lay sleepless for days as thy raining continued, thy heat of thy sun baking corpses like food 
Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies threw what was my hood 
It was right azt that moment thy Wraith had appeared, and thy message it left me might sound kind of weird

(peace, love, worth, hope)

Everything inside
Comes to me tonight,
Have you seen my praying?

In this factory
No one here to see me
Smiling at the heavens

Everybody here is breathing
Everybody here is hoping
Can you feel the love flow?

Everybody here is dreaming
Everybody here is calling
Can you feel the love flow?

You will see the sky
Spread before your eyes,
So blue and like an ocean

A sea of hope is here
Just to help you walk,
As we cross the distance

Everybody here is breathing
Everybody here is hoping
Can you feel the love flow

Everybody here is dreaming
Everybody here is calling
Can you feel the love flow?

Everybody lives together in hope...

From the people that she left behind

To live her life so free
Although many people wanted to clip her wings

She ran away
She broke away the chains
That they wrapped around her heart

The worst one was just leaving without saying goodbye

Woo
Woo

All my niggas gone bust they guns
Real mother fuckers never trust niggas, but we trust our guns
Get money is the code of the streets
Live by it, and they say the hotter the bullets, the colder the streets
Like the older the hammer, the older the beef
You holding the can and you busting or you die with your heat
Me and my niggas gone survive in the street
For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggas, just dieing to sleep
I'm in the hood and I ain't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO, with a pump in the seat and a desert eagle in the head rest
Live and I took 5, get respect cause I wont die
So its a bet that I'm gone ride

I'm riding dog, you riding with me? (ride with me)
If I'm frying dog, you frying with me? (fry with me)
If I'm dieing dog, you dieing with me? (die with me)
Just know when the beef come, we all busting our guns (what?)

We can beef, I don't give a fuck, any street, stoop or block
Compton, New York City of Rocks
You ain't never been out the hood? don't go to far
12 gauge shotty, with a pump like Joe Dumar's
Shells the size of Sprewell lugs, go through cars
Rip apart your new Bentley nigga, like Dre sent me
The haze in me make me wanna kick back
Your man work out at bally's, put the 38 to a 6 pack
And beef keep the E.R full til the shit packed
No more rooms? let em die in the streets
Im from the CPT, where niggas dieing to eat
Them niggas with scars under they left eye and they cheek
Park a 745 on your street
Like mother fucker if you don't ride with me, you can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedy's nigga
I empty desert clips out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

[Chorus: x2]

I got niggas that'll beef for the game
Run up on your man, splat his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood, you better pay up
I roll with killas, that'll put you in a hole like a lay up
Ain't no sleep on the block, my niggas stay up
Cause they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales
Be in the XXL, and its only 6 street rappers if you wanna be real
That go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggas
Say my name in a verse if you ready to die
I call up my Harlem niggas on the i95
10 minutes later you dead on the I95

[Verse One]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Goin to the movies packin his and her nine's
Wearin Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

[Verse Two]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, aiyyo Jeep kid
Drivin down the street pumpin, ""Apache you ain't shit!""
Snappin on niggaz, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand..

[Verse Three]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MC's injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed tears when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

I need a gangsta bitch, yo! (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

So make way for hip-hop's green beret
Bring on the refills, you see we feel
The name of the brain game is kill or be killed
I'm an expert, who will be the next jerk to try?
Let me explain you got 8 million ways to die
We torch and scorch ya, make ya feel real sore
Have that ass looking just like this boo-boo slipped the door
Known to kill, dunk skills, e-rupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill ya, I'ma leave ya body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie one to a truck and go drag ya ass
I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit ya prop, go straight back down ya throat

You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chico stick
I know who beat'cha quick (who?), my grip
Failing this to some type of tournament
I cut ya fucking head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
He's with the 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dove site in Queens

From dusk 'til dawn from night 'til mourn
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks
'Til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk

So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time

It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' a**, creepin' fast
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'

You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin' in the air
Like a chandilier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty
Even though I'm low-key, you know me

You be singin' over my tracks like it's kareoke
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff
Droppin' math'matics, layin' you out like craftmatic

I'll let you have it, so you don't want the static

So hold the Latin Quarter,  behold the prophecy
I'm levitatin' on water, demonstratin' somethin' properly
The A to the be	, there can only be one
Freeze time through the needle when my vinyl gets spun
Get respect 'cause I earn it, first time learn it
With the keys to six, but the five'll burst and invert it
Spray and burn it like I'm holdin areosol to a brick wall
Type my name indelibly, so my legend won't fall
Apani why'all yes yes, the rest are powerless
Who assassinate the queen, our strikers shut 'em down like gravity

Who stay spittin' flows that get underground booties and cats pissed,
Jean,  black listed from shows, the rap antagonist
I work with ladies with brains twisted and talkin' loud and shit
I'll liqour it, fire spittin' women will knuckle you bitch
You troublin' whips, niggas rent, can't afford a six
Crash and when the cops come, you'll find me hurlin' the fifth
We got no dough, frozen wrists, or Cris',
guns'll bust when wind blows
My fist could knock holes though nigga
Wittier shit, gritty as hell, pretty as fuck
Dirty as motherfuckers who actually fuck they mother's what
If you don't like it,  then don't listen, but don't talk
I'll run up in your prom, with cans of blood on the catwalk
I ain't playin', have you standin' there,
bloody, drippin, and laughin' 'cause it's all your fault
Shut da fuck up!

""It'll just take me to show ya""

You shut da fuck up!

This is real life rap, these niggas not ready for
No posin and crap, beg your pardon, por favor
Superior, Orator came jaws like Thor
Soon as I drop some thunder shit, greedy niggas want more
Run the play-by-play, tackle cats like a fullback
It's a dangerous game, come strong or get your skull cracked
Blahti raise the thermostat, collapse, robber formats
Dodge traps like the clap, do it for all ghetto blacks
Stand firm like I'm cemented, Jean Grae my comrad
Enter the Dragon, we demented, sick, and highly complemented
Slick witted, star figures, acid-laced hallucigenics
We fire-spittin' bitches, disregard the bullshittings

Niggas stay runnin your mouth, teeth or shit drippin off
Bottomed-out, permanent south, some bitter cats, so fuck why'all
We hot on wax, we hot on stage
My tongue's a twelve gauge, lips,  uzis, spray the page
why'all some click-n-drag niggas,  chatroom with fag niggas
Backpack and bag niggas,  play body and tag niggas
We raps best when we step in the ring
Get knocked 'fore the first bell, hell with the clock
We dirty be-atch (We drunk)
Apani tree'd up, chillin and speed Jean up
why'all industry skeed niggas snortin the whole ki up
And still won't sign us, they rhyme but minus the clothes
Please, why'all just in jobs for these hoes

Apathy," 

Hook plays once

""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal.""

[Verse 1]
I spit, to make the mic like a flammable torch
""It's understandable"" my mind is a mechanical force
And I'm a cannibal my mandible is chewin' ya corpse
""I'm tyrannical, a vandle of intangible sorts
Not a mineral a mammal or an animal, I'm.
Metaphysical, the syllables in critical rhymes
Flows blowin' off ya limbs like invisible mines
Been invincible with rhymes since the biblical times
A warlord with a sword from the Mongul Horde
Speak the tongue of the lord, to bless my vocal chords
They tried to resurrect hip-hop, but faith is gone
So I'll take it over by force like Ghengis Khan
If you say it ain't raw, you better pray to Allah
'cause I got an arrow that'll travel straight through the jaw
Got breath control, flow like a ship with a sail
Divine when I spit, like if I sipped from the grail
'cause I'm immortal

Hook repeats twice
""I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal."" IMMORTAL

[Verse 2]
I'm underground like communities of homeless bums
Sleepin' by the third rail where the A Train runs
My brain strains to lift freight trains from off the ground
When I'm walkin' around, I'm the talk of the town
'cause I harness mental powers scientists don't understand
So I'm on the low hiding from the average man
In a bad savage land I'm rockin' a gas mask
With black gats attached to snaps on back packs
To easily grip, when frequency blips
Alert me to intruders in the sewers where I secretly sit
Fine tunin' my rhymes until I got the hottest style
Then wrestle the mics from mutated crocodiles
That slipped into the pipes sometime in '88
Now they taste nuclear waste that makes 'em radiate
I'm subterranean, and melt the steel titanium

With powers of urainium comin out of my crainium. immortal

Hook repeats twice

[Verse 3]
I'll walk through Hell till it freezes
If Reverend Run sells his Addidas
I stomp cats and leave a path of skeletal pieces
Ya'll are washed up like shellfish on beaches
I'm a genius that's developed speeches deeper than telekinesis
My immortality's recorded on record
Never distorted, contorted it into 240 seconds
You pressed ya single up but nobody will hear you
Like that Puerto Rican flag CD hangin' off ya rear view
GET READY TO RUMBLE, let's get busy
I'll spin the axis backwards, make ya planet dizzy
Decapitatin' catchin' the quickening when I'm spittin
I be wettin motherfuckers like a christening and cripplin'
Ya click, quick with equipment equipped
Like bloods blast crips
My hammer never clicks, pack back up clips
Slaughter all the competition when rippin a mortal man
And cut ya heads off, like only an immortal can.

Hook repeats twice

Apathetic is immortal, I'll live forever
""Forever, forever ever, forever ever?""
One Two is immortal, I'll love forever

Intro cuts : ""You know, in school.
Everyone tries their very best to learn good habits
So we're going to try to do the very same thing
As we sing.""

Verse 1 (character: Jeff)
All star quarterback, varsity letter, I drive a Jetta
A popular kid, my parents give me all my cheddar
Plus I date Heather, the flyest girl in our school
I got a very large house, with an inground pool
I rock Polo and Abercrombie & Fitch, I'm rich
Pompous and arrogant, makin' fun of nerd clicks
You motherfuckin' freaks and geeks are dumb
With ya painted white face, and pierced nose and tongue
I pass my classes with ease and get an ""A""
Cheatin. 'cause if I don't pass, I don't play
I'll shove you in ya locker and I'll get in ya face
Put you in ya place, 'cause you fuckin nerds are a waste of air
Black clothes, blank stare, died hair
You could die tomorrow and nobody would care
I'll push on the floor when all the halls are crowded
But you're just a wimp, whatcha gonna do about it?

[Hook]
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more ""F's""
No breath inside your chest.
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more. school

Verse 2 (character: girl)
Four years of high school, I can't believe its here
My senior year, waitin for the crowd to cheer, at graduation
I haven't decided my occupation, but my major in college is gonna be
communications
I'm nice to everybody in school, whether cool, or uncool. I'm neutral
An outstanding pupil like my teachers say
I never missed a single day
Always on the honor roll, never less than an ""A""
I help jocks with their grades, even that jerk Jeff
Who's an ass, but never woulda passed class with an ""F""
Kids he picks on are smarter then him, and smaller than him
Never larger or taller than him
But this one kid, named Jay.
That jeff calls gay, and beats up, doesn't look very normal today
So I give a little smile and he gives one back
Then he walks by and reaches into his napsack
I feel like I want to run, but my whole body's stunned
I can't believe it, but Jay's got a ..

[Hook]

Verse 3 (character: Jay)
My name is Jason, a real big fan of death
I sit back thinkin' of Jeff and I take a deep breath
How'd I'd love to fire 30 slugs into his chest, till nothin' is left
I'm always frustrated with stress, I want respect
Back when I was 6 I'd dissect insects, and spray house pets with Windex
I'm Beelzebub on drugs
The intellect of a David Berkowitz, roamin' on the internet
I'm sick of gettin pushed around bein' clowned
When I'm the most powerful evil being in town
I wake up at 5:30 and stare into space
Walk into my parents room and shoot 'em both in the face
Take a shower get dressed load my weapon for school
Walk through the hall, step over the large blood pool
On the bus with a semi-automatic in knapsack
Smile on my face, as I sit in the back
Then I step into the building and I almost feel invincible
Wave to the nurse, say hi to the principal
Walk to to my locker, everything seems slow
Then I Jeff. and here we go
Weapons out the bag, people stop speakin', girls shreikin'
I start shootin' rounds till Jeff's chest is bleedin'
His head explodes then I start to reload
Nobody can hurt me now. 'cause I'm in murder mode
Fire at everybody that's directly in my sight
But layin' on the ground on the somebody is I like
This girl who I've known who's always nice and talks to me
Crawls to me, coughin' up blood and awkwardly
Whispers two words right before her head drops
She opened her mouth and said. ""please. stop""
I could never begin to describe the way I felt
I dropped to my knees, turned the gun on myself
And pulled the trigger.

Have conversations with your girl while she sits on my lap
Yo stop talking about they girls man it's starting to get old
Well, um, no tell they girls to stop leaving they clothes

The reason I flow, is not to just get us indoors
Pops in barber shops like my son is better than yours

Pull dimes that start trends, while your trying to make amends

Actually the wrong one, you bust with small guns

I look like an MC who murders the spot
Like ""Derek Jeter"" looks like a smaller version of ""The Rock""
Bitch please, I never ever met a dick-tease
I'm so cool that when I spit free's my spit freeze

""Old Yeller"", I'm known to leave a fella
With more cuts and scratches than the ""Shook One's"" acapella
You want to fuck around with ""Esoteric""
And blown on some bullshit like working-dice-credit

When rappers try, they usually step and die
Then MC's get the message like a number I don't recognize
Your call her back, pop minds they hear me freestyle
And spend the next seven days hittin' redial

I stay on tracks, while throwing rappers under the train
I'm numbing your brain, stunning you while tonguing your dame

A ""Demigod"" that's beyond your small blundering brains
Fortunate fame, really it's just one in the same
That I obtain while your still a bum begging for change

Trying to front like your new and really nothing has changed
You ain't underground, your locked in a dungeon with chains
Your not a thug 'cause' you rock your little ""Lugz"" and a chain
I'm a slug, nah fuck that, I'm double the pain

Your hussling game is lame, couple bucks and a name
Maybe some buckets of champagne with sluts in the range
I'll fuck with your brain and flex so your muscles are strained

Sie ist ein Glühwürmchen, Jenny from the block.
Zwischen Scheunentor und Dorfplatz in ihrem kurzen Rock.
Eine zum Kühe umstoßen und zu Pferde stehlen, 
und wo der Fuchs dem Hasen ""gute Nacht"" sagt-Schäfchen zählen.
Und an der Raststätte trinkt sie alle unter den Tisch.
Wo man bei Novoline und Obstwein seinen Kummer vergisst.
Den doofen Witz hat der Wirt zwar schon oft gemacht, 
doch Jenny denkt sich Humor ist es wenn man trotzdem lacht.
Blauer Mascara, Extensions und Nikes, Frauen sind Drama, alle Männer sind gleich.
Du bist nicht wirklich hübsch, doch siehst so gut aus, wie du nur kannst.
Du blinkst im Taktflackern der Lichtorgel zu Phoenix und tanzt.
Ich bin verliebt, aber du bist hier die Dorfmatratze.
Und ich kenn` niemanden, der dich nicht schon vorher hatte.

Mit zehn finden alles was erlaubt ist doof,
Mit zwölf raucht sie Dope auf dem Pausenhof,
Ein Jahr später sind schon jeden Tag die Augen rot,
Und mit Vierzehn in jedem Laden Hausverbot.
Der erste Freund, sie ist Teil seiner Gang,
Langeweile, er schmeißt Teile, wenn sie bei`n`ander pennen.
Du hast zwar dicke Dinger, aber `ne dünne Haut.
Und unter ihr geht dein lautes Herz im Stillen drauf.
Doch du fässt immer wieder ins Feuer, vergisst, dass es heiß ist.
Und dieses Dicke Baby mit Flügeln beschießt dich mit Pfeilgift.

Es ist so laut zwischen den Autos auf dem Parkplatz
Ich dreh mich um wo sind die Dudes mit den ich da war
doch neben mir liegt nur ein Penner stinkend in mein Parker

Ich bin mit mein Freunden und vier Kisten Bier
in der S-Bahn gefahrn und an jeder Station tranken alle auf Ex
und wir durch die Stadt, und ihr Pisser nehmt Flaschen
und schmissen sie lachend auf Ticker und Spasten
was Money halt macht
Wir steigen aus wo ist die nächste Party
schau in mein Lauf Großwildjäger auf Safari
Am Eingang hat sich einer ein gebaut
deshalb fliegen wir beim reingehen
auch gleich schon wieder raus
Ich mache 'nen Polnischen
den ich seh neben den Club eine Frau
Ich erkenne sie nich richtig
doch denke mir besser ich pippe sie auf
Sie hat lange Haare und ganz weiche Lippen des will ich

wo ich mit meiner Hand ganz fest in einer Wand stecke
kein Plan warum?! was ist passiert?
wir wollten feiern gehn doch dann ist es eskaliert
denn der Spast lies und nicht rein
ey wie spießig kann man sein?
also spieten sein Drink
und dann schlief er wie ein Stein
T-back, Fotoseason,
Hodenlecken
Instagram, Shitstorm
echt fett, Yolo teng
Und wir surften drin auf den Hit
zu der Bar Frau hin
klatsch das Ding auf den Tisch
eine Runde auf's Haus wir beide unterm Tresen
danach tun wir schön so als wäre nichts gewesen
und ich binnn schon fast drin
da kommt der Spast von vorhin
klatscht meine Freunde
krachende Fäuste
überall Blut
Und er lacht nur und grinst
und ich komme wie in Zeitlupe
zu den Opfer gerannt
hohle aus und schlag einfach nur ein Loch
in eine Wand

Uni bringt nichts außer BAföG man fährt nur hin weil man muss
Schon am zweiten Tag des Monats, da verschwindet das Plus

Draußen ist Winter, Scheiben beschlagen, der Kühlschrank meist leer
Haben darum nur Zweifel im Magen, Finger fühlt man nicht mehr
Achtzig Euro bleiben über nach der Miete und Strom
Die Fünfzig auf den Schein fühlt sich fast an wie 'ne Million

Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude

He sniffed some coke, come home

When your moms come home off the midnight shift

You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away

Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow

why won't you let him be what he wants to be

And more than once he's gone home with a bloody nose
he's not like them and they can't ignore it. So they all hate him for it.

Instead of those the trouble they hand him, why don't they try to understand 
him.

Brownsville come on
Bedstop come on
Fort Green come on
Everybody come on
Queens Bridge come on
South bronx come on
Uptown come on
Everybody come on

Let's take a walk threw the deepest part of the hood
I want to know who it was that said it was all good
He must of never been to the corner, and spent the half an hour
Longer, where you could smell reality stronger
Where they sell you grease in a box and hope that you die quicker
And if your old enough to walk to the store you can buy liqour
Where you can find a dice game at any time of the night
And somebody gets shot or stabbed every time there's a fight
Where cats die in the blue sky in the sunlight
And ya bound to get clowned for not holdin ya gun right
By little kids with great game cause they learned to take aim
At a young age, and to allude police, with a fake name
he's tellin him, i'm Bobby Jackson from 3-be
When the fact is he's really Rashun from 4-D
Hey this is going out to your hood straight from mine
Ayyo, lets take a walk in blue skys and sunshine

Blue skys, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in a..

Overhere it's either rap hustle crack or play ball
And gats niggas carry ain't small
The cats that used to be kids when you ran the halls, is the drug lords
His broad the same chick that liked you from the 4th floor
Her older brother he the neighborhood bully
You and him cool but he keep playin ya boy cause he pussy
Where the old ladies be up in ya be-i
Callin 9-11 everytime you in the yard tryin to be high
Dice games could turn into a shootout quick
If you sayin he aced then he sayin he sixed
People waitin for the mail to get they check
And blue skys and sunshine you gotta give respect to get respect
You know

Blue skys, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in a..

Long beach come on
5th floor come on
Everybody come on
Brick CIty come on
Caprinne Green come on
West Philly come on
Everybody come on

And oh yeah, if you see a girl on the block be sure if you rush over
Cause 14 year old girls be dressin like the much older
See that one chick walkin the block tryin to get paid
Is in the same class as ya sister and still in the 10th grade
And ya might see ya neighbor, down at the corner Bodega
Buyin the malt liqour in exchange for a used sega
You can even buy ya clothes on the block, imagine that
From Versace to a cool-g sweater, and a matchin hat
See this cats got a big bag of stuff that he just stole
It's the same old routine, but it never gets old
And ya might catch a cab if you live on the right block
From Black Pearl to White Top yo they might stop
They got a bulletproof partition, cause niggas draw heat
But the driver, got a bigger one, up under the seat
See cats don't really want to kill they tryin to eat
Yo ain't it a nice day to take a walk in the street

Never thought that I'd be seen on these streets again
It's been five years at least
Waiting for a piece
Bouncing off of these walls awaiting my release
Pacing like a caged lion
With rage prying
All them days trying to engage with the iron
Stuck in between a rock and a hard place
I got down on my knees, looked into God's face
Its really not the same, is it?
With low digits
And y'all ain't hold me down, ain't paid me no visits
New cats claiming shit just like they bought stock
And y'all let em move in and take over the block
I heard y'all be out there spending dubs with em
Out all night long, going to clubs with em
I guess thats what I get for having a kind heart
Today's when they life end and mine starts

Sometimes waking up is even kinda scary
Some foul deeds I find necessary
Like the Christ and the Judas theory
I feel the hurt and scream loud but nobody hears me
My broken body bleeds heavy plus my mind is weary
Slipped the mickey when they first gave me sex
Addicted to the trees, Henneseys and cigarettes
Inhaling the toxic gases when I breath
Study words of higher deity cause him I believe
I don't pray on my knees
Just in case the evils comes like D's
I'll be ready to blast and make him bleed
In high double-digits I go back to the essence
Leave my rhymes behind so you can use em for lessons
Like a new Revelations chapter
You ain't moving slow, it's just that in my mind I'm moving faster
Sick messiah like I'm David Koresh
You done picked the wrong nigga to test
Now pick - the trey pound or the tech

Nach unten zieht

Apocalyptica,"All that I ever wanted
To understand my nightmares
Possessed by my fears
Betrayed by my pride
Alone I wandered in the deepest dark
Seeking comfort from the vanity
Each time I escaped the real
My soul died, died a bit more
Confronting the evil within
Praying for my angel to appear
Agonized whisper into the emptiness
Begging for salvation - salvation for this cursed mind
Words without meaning
Touch without feeling
I do not recognize my own face
Eyes that were once shining
Now extinguished
Left only a silent cold
Sound of a tear falling down
In the desperate hour of loneliness
This shattered heart reaching
For it's relief - the relief it cannot find
Glance without affection
Kiss without sensitivity
Promise without comprehension
Love without hope
I do not remember my own tale
Betrayed by my anger
Betrayed by my delusions
Betrayed by my lust

Strength - to be released from my demons
(I desire)
Wisdom - to forgive the past

Yo 
I'm like a country wild western, rhyme style murderer 
X-Ecutioners, cuttin things you never heard of 
Flip new beats, never once flipped a burger 
But I flame-broil, and still remain loyal 
On the hip-hop throne, and most kings I been doin it 
Rock, Rob, Joe, and Big E is one unit 
Supreme force, ever since Main Source, my nigga 
Shoulda had yo ass drunk like liqour, in a stuper 
Got to stay super, with the Cash Flow 
Never bashful, here's what you asked fo' 
The best DJ's in the world today 
Cuttin up 'Rock the Bells' LL Cool J 
and many more, Robbie Swift and he raw 
Roc Raida, number one chop innovator 
Total Eclipse, man you know that he flips 
and he diminished the, record like my man Joe Sinister 
I'ma lay back and watch 'em bless the track 
For the hip-hop world, cuz these brothers don't slack 
They always comin with the up-to-par 
You can call X-Ecutioners the best by far...

Yo, I take you back to the cave man era 
Survival and how to live, on ways I get better 

I'm too deep to peek, rock niggaz to sleep 
I'm like a four star general, out in the street 
Keep my business low, represent Cash Flow 
Bustin loose like Chuck Brown to get that dough 
Most of y'all could tell, I come from the ghetto 
Eight blocks from flushin metal where my family settle 
Got Chinese, Korean, Asian 
Used to link up with Nas, from Corntop Choice, for female persuasion 
Bustin off in the park, that was in the dark 
I'm real not fake so please don't pretend to part 
I'm lettin it start, the glamour the bucks 
Gotta get mine, cuz beef got stamina and guts 
Plus the phat beat, plus the rhyme plus the cuts

Cuts galore..

To myself I am pondering
Thinking about all these things
That's bothering me lately

Why is this pressure all on me?
Why this negativity?
If something's wrong blame it on me
B E Y O N C E

Shut up, no one said to open your mouth
Shut up, if you do not like me how about
Shut up, why waste your energy on me?
Shut up, is it 'cause you wanna be me?

No more lying, no more hating
No more dissing, no more snaking
No more cheating, no more sneaking
No more bugging, no more judging

Everybody judging me
Knowing nothing about me
Causing insecurities
Because of someone's jealousy

Losing all my privacy
Wanting much more normalcy
Learning to appreciate mainly
Gifts my God has given me

Shut up, no one said to open your mouth
Shut up, if you do not like me how about
Shut up, why waste your energy on me?
Shut up, is it 'cause you wanna be me?

No more lying, no more hating
No more dissing, no more snaking
No more cheating, no more sneaking
No more bugging, no more judging

Love yourself
If not to live life for you
And nobody else
Nobody else

No more lying, no more hating
No more dissing, no more snaking
No more cheating, no more sneaking
No more bugging, no more judging

No more lying, no more hating
No more dissing, no more snaking
No more cheating, no more sneaking
No more bugging, no more judging

No more lying, no more hating
No more dissing, no more snaking
No more cheating, no more sneaking
No more bugging, no more judging

No more
No more
No more

We fought side by side
No one had more

Sharper consonants than you, love
And my vowels, well, were trusted

First comes the Birch
Rowan followed by the Ash
Then through the Alder she forms
And merges with Willow

The Hawthorne blossoms
As the Oak guards the door
She is the hinge on which the year swings
He courts the lightning flash and her

Summoning the spirits
Through incantations
You said the Thunder God seems to have
And our enemies are the Reed
But we knew the Furies held the Holly sacred

We were insulated
In a circle of words we'd drawn
With wisdom sent from nine Hazels
A Rowan fire and a Willow rod

At ten comes the vine
That generates bramble wine
The constant change of the night sun
A song in the blood of the white bull

Only revealed through visions

The White Poplar's gift to the souls of the dead
A promise that it was not the end
But for the vine the ""U"", its coffer

Vowels and consonants
The power of trees
The power they hold
The power of prose

So when the church
Began to twist the old myths
They built their own Tower of Babel
From Ulster to Munster

The Reed gave way then
To the Elder
The Earth turns her will

From Winter to Winter
At day the Ash had power over the Alder

Rupturing a delicate balance
When I left my world for his

Day after day, as my city fades
And is swallowed by his sea
She is boundless ?
Even breaking ? home the beach

Every alchemist
Knows fusion and fission
Can unify or drive a force to spend
He has been possessed to drink of the spices
From the east by his liquid mistress
Which then pushed me into the lair of uranium
She divides time between greed and his twin, (some mythological name)

Day after day cities are betrayed
As the earthly sons lay their blades ?

And she is boundless ?
But by then she has been frayed
As the night gives way
To Nautical dawn I can see I must activate

It weighed as much as a feather
Your words fly off the screen
Sayin' shit that you don't mean
Tommy two-cocks, not far from the shore
Will it be all right if I can sleep on the floor?

Apostle of Hustle,"Some rock sometime
So whats up with your neighborhood block?
You rode a bull is that a fact?
Well it dropped you on the corner with the darkness deep in tact
I see most do euthanize
My invisible sensation don't ever leave me dry
It gets late comes on strong
Well there's so much work to do dark is what I want
When you walk you walk tall
Because you know your enemies and they wanna see you crawl
A little rush holds the key
Well the third time from behind dark is what you dream
In town around
Well lets make use of each other until somebody drowns
Rest a while restaurant
Well I know I may look hungry girl dark is what I want",Dark Is What I Want/Strutters Ball,2004
Apostle of Hustle,"In the rhythm of this song,
Well we drink and fucking fight when we bring it on

Prayer, that some might answered you
But your lips are red, girl, they know what to do

Powerful grace there's a fight he's so devout
There's a waterfall of sewage from his mouth

You, children of this dying earth
Our possessions and our money have no worth

All the gods are driving us in ways
We do not understand
All the gods are driving us in ways
We do not understand
Do not understand

Calm us of our drug delivery
Well we vowed to end our mother's misery
Wind that fills the world with bitch's breath
You know that it's called the energy of death

I went in to the wrong house last night
I crawled into the wrong bed

Lookin' for a new technique
They'd never believe I throw my weapons down
Another page turn of the book
Another one falls on their knees on the ground

The message from the tiger she shivered
Like a cord on a harp with a failure
Bedroom
He returned to the delusion of same
He reached for the lipstick and her handbag by the edge of the sink
It's a sad love surrounded by the lady of perpetual squalor

You run, you fly, you're chased by ghosts
You cannot say goodbye

Chances are not forever

I see, I see a new lover coming
He's flash, walking across your eyes

After time, then you can act suprised

You'll kiss, you'll try, you're chased by ghosts,
You cannot say goodbye

Deep in her memory, a kiss never fades
Powerful hands, guiding her braids

Deep in her memory, an emptiness waits
And gathers its forces and camps by the gates

Hollow and stale, groan goodbyes
And see how it goes, see how it goes
There's a bombproof shell
Who made that call and didn't tell
Rats rebuilding empty streets
Under our feet
See how it goes, see how it goes
One more slip and through the door
That's all it takes and nothing more
Deserted nightclub, silent glass
Just wait till night and then a tad

Apostle of Hustle,"Down in a southern town
A devil took both my eyes
She buried them in the sand
She wanted me to hold her hand

Is it coke or would you like a beer?
No, I want what burns and is clear
When it's clear and it burns to the taste
It puts beauty back in its place

The first of this devil was worse

It spoke through my fingers in verse
Let the children feast on the street
Cause they don't care what they eat
Let the horses all starve in a ditch
Let the architects sit and get rich
Let the Christians call down from above
Let them starve for wanting of love and
If he exists he's out of sight
Or under cheap fluorescent light

He quit the house made of roses and rose flavored spit
Paris with a dagger on his mind and romance in his hand
Tough and hard, in the yard, now nothing but a stranger in a strange land

Socrates in swaying the youth away
Branches thick with heat and syrupy decay
Picks up a book commands him to read
The part where he kisses him on the roof
Breaking dawn, woe be gone, hit the dope
And hope they become pure and aloof

They all tried to bully him, buy him, score it for cheap
