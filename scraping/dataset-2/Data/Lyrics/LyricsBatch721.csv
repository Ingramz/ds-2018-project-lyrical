Michael Franti,"Whatever happen to the sun
It seems to always come
Back when we were young
We'd sing and party all night long
The season don't ever come on time no more
War paints over the years
And anger fills our tears
What happen to the sun

But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

Every time I read the news
I'm always more confused
Tellin' me to choose
But there's only lies to choose from
And how many died today
How many lost their homes or shot a gun
Or a love one
What happen to our sons

But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
And I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

I know I'm far away from home but I know I'm not alone
I know I'm far away from home but I know I'm not alone",I Know I'm Not Alone,2006
Michael Franti,"It never makes no sense, it never makes no sense
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter
Fire fire fire 
Armageddon is a deadly day
Armageddon is a deadly way
They comin' for you everyday
While senators on holiday 

The army recruiters in the parking lot
Hustling the kids there jugglin' pot 
""Listen young man, listen to my plan, 
Gonna make you money, gonna make you a man""

Bom, bom 

Here's what you get
An M-16 and a kevlar vest 
You might come home 
With one less leg
But this thing will surely keep a bullet out of your chest 

So come on, come on 
Sign up, come on 
This one's nothing like Vietnam 
Except for the bullets, except for the bombs
Except for the youth that's gone 

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher 
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter
Fire fire fire
So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher 
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter 
Fire fire fire 

Tell me president, tell if you will
How many people does a smart bomb kill?
How many of em do you think we got?
The general says we never miss a shot 
And we never ever ever keep a body count
We killin' so efficiently we can?t keep count 
In the Afghan hills the rebels still fightin'
Opium fields keep on providin'
The best heroin that money can buy 
And nobody knows where Osama been hidin'
The press conferences keep on lyin'
Like we don't know 

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher 
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter 
Fire fire fire
So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher 
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter 
Fire fire fire 

Some say engine, engine number nine
Machine guns on a New York transit line 
The war for oil is a war for the beast
The war on terror is a war on peace 
Tellin' you they?re gonna protect you
Tellin' you that they support the troops 
Don't let them fool you with their milk and honey
No, they only want your money 
One step forward and two step back
One step forward and two step back
Why do veterans get no respect?
PTSD and a broken back
Take a look at where your moneys gone, see
Take a look at what they spend it on 
No excuses, no illusions 
Light up ya lighter, bring em home

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher 
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter 
Fire fire fire 
So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher 
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter

Michael Franti,"I've been down for far too long
'Til my faith was nearly gone
I never knew somebody just like you
Could be a friend I could call my own

'Til I let go of a broken heart
I let go to an open heart
I let go of my broken dreams

I believe in the one I love

And take one step closer to you
I just take one step closer to you
Even when I've fallen down
My heart says follow through
I take one step closer to you

I never meant to hurt you, no
And you never meant to hurt me too
But it seems like you always do
And even though I'm scared sometimes
If ever see you fallen down
I will be the one that's there for you

When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.

I have been traveling down this river, so many rocks pop up in my site.
I've got to make some quick decisions, should I go left or should I go right.
I pray for guidance and protection, it keeps my boat water tight.
But, I know if I just keep on believin', every little thing is gonna be alright.

When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.
When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.

The vampires gather around me, angling to take a bit.
They want to drink my blood of courage, and try to take away my fight.
But no, no, no, they can't do that, for one truth I've learned in life.
You want to scary away the vampires, you simple guide them into the light.

When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.
When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.

Call my name to kingdom come, spread my wings in flight.
I hope that when my day is over, My love, I see you in the light.

When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.
When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.

Razor wire on the street every corner,
90 degree's at six in the morning,
Boilin' water for the tea of the nation,
Plantin' seeds for the next generation.

Pack what ya need for your own protection.
Dance to the rhythm of the wheels on the street,
Long, long strides on the hot concrete.

Work all day in the middays sun,
Break your back till the night time come,
Sing for your bread and sing for your water,
Sing for your sons and sing for your daughters,
Sing your pops and sing for your mommas,
Sing for your breakfast, pray for your suppa

Chauffeur drives you around, everybody knows

Your father would be with her if only he could
But don't you play with me, 'cause you're playin' with fire
If you're playin' with me, then you're playin' with fire

Now she gets her kicks in Stepney, not in Knightsbridge anymore

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, keep bringing it the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight.

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, you're running for the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight.

Boom, boom!

There's a battle going on in this earth
Everyday. Work, school, death, and birth.
There are 6 billion people on this earth,
Can you tell me what every single life is worth?

Toke a spliff, look around and see history.
My weapon and my method is no mystery.
I didn't come here to chill. I came here to rock,
To smash the empire with my boom-box.

You got to let go of remote control!

[Chorus: x2]

You know you got to put up a fight.
On a universal mission like a meteorite.
Satellite, laser beam with you in their sights.
And with the patriot act they took all your right.

Don't ever doubt the power of just one mind.
Or the world-wide power of just one rhyme.
Don't ever doubt the force of the baseline.
Or a record gone round to burn the house down.

(You got to let go of remote control.)

[Chorus]

(All rebel rockers!)

There's a bullet with your name, it's a sign of the times.
It takes nine hundred ninety nine criminal minds.
You got to let go of remote control.
You got to let go of remote control!

Some people always try to cheat their death but when it comes you just cant shake it
Some people try to make a deal to get a little bit more but they just can't take it
Some of them end up in debt, when their called they try to fake it
But one morning the clock will chime and no more birds come flying by 
And temperatures keep rising higher, sixteen bullets come flying by

Stopped N.Y. time you're in your car
Search your body search your home an' listenin' in on your phone calls

When the truth comes out all hell will call and someday Guantanamo will fall
Until that day we all will ride on

Then radio play the same 10 songs, set your clock by which ones on 
And watching the news try to see whats wrong, find somebody else to blame it on
Hope they never come and research you coz' your grandmother was an immigrant too
So if you love somebody better tell them so

Tell me why do they come to die here
And all the kids that used to run here
Tell me why did they load their guns here

From the Wall Street banks to the empty homes

And when we're making love, we make it so unique

You have my vote with the shake of your thighs
My whole world changed from one look in your eye
It's been a long time but now I realize

The only thing missing was you
The only thing missing was you
The only thing missing was you
The only thing missing was you
(You, you, you, you, you)
The only thing missing was you

Many moons have passed
And I'm still here at sea
And I'm searching for one island in the stars
The size of you and me, you and me

How was I to know
When I thought I had it all along
The only thing missing was you
The only thing missing was you

The only thing missing was you
The only thing missing was you
(You, you, you, you, you)
The only thing missing was you

I've been waiting all along for a woman like you
(Only thing missing was you)
Woman like you, woman, woman like you
(The only thing missing was you)
I've been waiting all along for a woman like you
Like you, like you
Waiting all along for a woman like you

They say there may be rain but the sun is hot
I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I've got to pay
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in
So I jump back in there where I learned to swim
Try to keep my head above it the best I can, that's why

And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet

God knows when

In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills

Do it for the love, not for the money
Not for the guns and not for the honeys
Do it ‘cause it makes you feel alive
Like the way we rockin’ on Saturday night
Do it for the love of it, do it for the smell of it
Do it for the joy and the taste and the hell of it
Do it ‘cause you love it and it makes no sense
Not yens or euros or dollars or cents

When I was a little, little boy I knew I’d grow up
To be somebody that my mama said would always show up
To work, to school and all that’s cool
But, following rules was never my strong suit, you know
I bought a guitar, a microphone too
Set out to do what I was born to do
And mama said something as I was walking out the door

[Chorus]
Do it for the love, not for the money
Not for the guns and not for the honeys
Do it ‘cause it makes you feel alive
Like the way we rockin’ on Saturday night
Do it for the love of it, do it for the smell of it
Do it for the joy and the taste and the hell of it
Do it ‘cause you love it and it makes no sense

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Just for the love of it

Life is never easy and you better know it
Sometimes it’s like the date you’re waiting for that doesn’t show up
You got to pay the rent, or else you owe it
And like a credit card, you know you better not blow it
And if you got beef with someone, let go it
And if you got love for someone, you better show it
Mama said this as I was walking out the door

Somebody told me don't stare at horizons
Unless you are ready to run

Drinking 40s and rolling up some sticky icky
Under the stars or maybe even Mars
Muscle cars are smoking up the boulevard
You look pretty out of the city
You said you love me and there's no place you wanna go alone

Just a little more time for me
Just a little more time that we could be together
We go on and on, and on and on [x2]
We leave it behind but we’re still moving on and on

I remember when we use to play hopscotch out on the sidewalk
I would draw your picture there with my white chalk
Every day we’d ride bikes home through the schoolyard
We would eat, sleep, work just so we could play hard
Tired of calling mom saying “please come get me”
Traded in my bike for a beat up Chevy
Pops was home drinkin’
I was home dreamin’
And the years fly by like, boom!

I remember rolling in my ride to the White Stripes concert
Climbing in the back seat
Rolling up your short skirt
Steamed up windows
Then we graduated
Said good-bye to the town that we hated
Life gets harder every single day
And when you fall down, that’s the rent that you pay
We used to say forever
Now we say remember
Look at all the bad and good we’ve seen together
I’m sorry that I lost you
Happy that I had you
My heart still beats like, boom!

Deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots

I'm protected by the one always greater than me

Because you wanna see
The contour of my mystery
The strength of my arches
The colour of my conscience
And the way that I process my diction
Some fact some diction some mystery
Some future fantasy
I'm the trunk that holds the branches
The leaves who do the dances
My flowers romantic
My love gigantic
From Africa, transplanted translantic
In the heat of the sun
I bring shade for everyone
Like the beat on the one
I'm the skin on the drum

I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum

I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one
Fire one
Fire two

See I've been fully marinated
And now I'm ready for the fire
See I'm beginning to perspire
From deep within to the skin
Yo, the feminine and the masculine
The pieces of the puzzle
See my reflections in the puddle
After the storm the purple of the sky
Brings to mind another time
When we resided
Below the water line
Life was fine there human divine
But in the years following
Evil men came swallowing
Everything in sight
Some learned to run, some stayed to fight
I kneeled at the tomb of the soldier
Said I would love to behold her
The magic in store there
She touched me on the shoulder
She said, ""in time all is revealed, box of light be unsealed
Now listen to me son, be like the skin on the drum""

And as the pepper gas clears
And police and protestors go home
Just as the morning dew are tear drops of the night
My emotions are always there for you
And will never leave you dry

Michael Franti & Spearhead,"The world around gotcha down
You got high blood pressure, people pushing you around
And some wanna tell you how you should behave
Cut your hair the right way, tell you what to say,
Hang out with the right folks, become a fashion slave

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)
But do you wanna feel freaky and free
But do you wanna feel free (I don't care where you come from)
Do you wanna feel free, free, free, free, freaky and free

(Chorus:)
Take your time
Unwind your mind
We all need a little soulshine
Take your time (go on, take it)
Unwind your mind
We could use a little soulshine

9 to 5, people tryin' to stay alive
Hard livin' in the city
You find a diamond in the sewer but the gas bills rise
But I got to say to them, ""what's it all mean?""
You gotta take a loan
To pay the bill on the phone
Educated, graduated but you can't get a job

But do you wanna feel free (and I say it again now)

Michael Franti & Spearhead,"You don't have to be so scared to share what's inside
'cause you're Daddy's little superstar
And you're Mama's little butterfly
Fly high

A strange strange litany of verses and reverses
Adlibs and rehearses
Clouds burst and words cursed
An argument breaks out
It's one we've all heard before, it's boring
Had us all snoring from the first line
One after another chimed in perfect time
Tired rehashes of petty cashes and mismatches
You shoulda coulda's
And ""why didn't 'tcha dida's""
Crippling snippets aimed at the heart
To inflame and impart blame
Framed like Mumia
Verbal diarrhea
Creating chasms between the souls of two
Or two billion
Nations torn apart
Station to station damnation
With much deliberation and very little consideration
To the return on the damage from the altercation
Collateral condemnation
Then denyin' like colorization of an old black and white
Create a revision of the recent last night
The fight that started with two words, ""I'm right""

[Chorus]
You don't have to be so scared to share what's inside
'cause you're Daddy's little superstar
And you're Mama's little butterfly
Fly high

But of course the fight ends with no resolution
Merely a vow for retribution, substitution, execution, electrocution
Ruthless, toothless and truthless
Mumbling through page after page of excuses
Abuses of the gift of the gab
Gabriel the trumpeter
Bestowed upon us a voice with a choice
And a tongue kept moist by years of salivating
For oysters, pearls and aphrodisiacs
Locked in an ugly shell always too chewy and gooey
So they get swallowed whole
But a tongue is so much more than a vehicle for greed
A tongue is for washing fur
Or for licking wounds
Or for welcoming newcomers into a room
Or cleansing those fresh from the womb
Without a tongue there would be no croons
Swoons, Junes under the moon
No bees pollinating no flowers in bloom
No recitation of words at the foot of a tomb
Or wills read aloud of the family heirlooms
You probably couldn't even blow up a balloon
And that would be a shame
Because to exhales the name of the game
Exhale from the heart
Not from the lungs
Exhale from the heart
Not from the tongue

[Chorus]

Listening is understanding
And finding compassion
Love is the action of soul satisfaction
A tongue can make wishes and also fine kisses
Taste a sweet cake and also cast disses
But nothing compares to the voice from within
Without it we might just be mannequins
Up to no darn good shenanigans
Learn to be skilful movers of the stones
That block the heart and turn humans to clones
Learn to forgive, set free the bones
Touch with your flesh, take off the rubber gloves
Love like your life depends on it
Because it does

[Chorus]",Speaking of Tongues,2001
Michael Franti & Spearhead,"When I was a younger man
People say don't dream too tall
'Cause if you live your life this way
You set yourself up for big falls
I stay up late in my room at night
Play my hoes on my turntable
Opened me to pure phat groove
Help my soul break down them walls

(Chorus)
I thank you
I thank you for all the music 
That you've shown to me
I thank you
'Cause you set me free
Free to simply just be me

You don't know all the influence
The subtle positives that you had on me
Came about like a renaissance
Like a little happy dance, got into my feet
But in your time, the roads you chose
Led you to your hard luck blues
I always feared what it was like
To live inside your big old shoes

You will not get it without a price
We don't mind
See we've been doin' it all the time
But if you want us to you sacrifice
You gotta give something back to life

You think I'm vulnerable to your pressure tactics
Because I shed a tear, 'cause I shed a tear
You think I'm vulnerable to your violence
Just 'cause I'm sittin' here
But my babies came into this world
Without a single fear, say they has no fear
'cause the seven generations before me
They all fought to get us here

You can't just come in here like that no more
And snatch up our childhood
You just can't walk on up
And replace it yo, with your Hollywood

And I'm prepared now
To suffer the penalties for speakin' the truth

Bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Whoa, we may even find a solution
To hunger and disease
We can bomb the world to pieces
But we can't bomb it into peace

Violence brings one thing
More more of the same
Military madness
The smell of flesh and burning pain

So I sing out to the masses
Stand up if you're still sane
To all of us gone crazy

Bring them to their knees
We can bomb the world to pieces

It got words

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem
It's written on the back of God's hand

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem
It's written on the back of God's hand

Ya see moms and pops be copulatin'
Plantin' seeds and pickin' weeds for another season
Another reason for livin' another reason for givin'
Another reason for lovin' and tryin' stay out of prison

'Cause everything in life can't be nice
And everything you want can't be got
But the lessons on beein' patient be causing the pressure to rise
And make some people suicidal

Oh no, another soul, has lost control
We pull him back into the fold
He got strung out on the material
All the superficial initials upon his clothes

They make me wanna go Sprewell
Every time I see my family locked in jail
The economical can be demoniacal
Keep love in your soul

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem
It's written on the back of God's hand

Ya see people are so beautiful in love
That's why I'm reminded of life's precious moments
Every time I see lovers walkin' by in the park
Close my eyes and I stop reminisce

To see a little baby suckin' on his mama's milk
'Ey silky smoothness of a lovin' caress holdin' baby to breast
And blessin' the world with another to test, test, test
Oh yes, oh yes, bom, bom, I'd like to sing a little song
Dedicated to the people who would like to sing along

'Cause every little song has little beats and notes
Like every little lake has little trees and boats
All people deserve a safe and warm home
'Cause every single soul is a poem

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem
It's written on the back of God's hand

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem
It's written on the back of God's hand

I want to show you somethin' beautiful
It's lovely, it's lovely
It's lovely, it's lovely, y'all

Right from the start in a world torn apart
A baby's love leaves finger prints upon the heart
So many think it but never say it
""Why bring a child to this planet full of hatred?""

They might not make it like the youngest departed
Or worst of all they might become a part of it
Involved in it, perpetuating violence, violence
And growing up in silence

Seein' things they don't know how to deal with
And learnin' ways, to try to cope with it
Cope with it, cope with it
But not lose hope

No matter where I roam
Whoa oh, I know every single soul is a poem
It's written on the back of God's hand

No matter where I roam

A war on Christians and Hindus
A whole lotta people just sayin' kill them all

They gotta a war on Mumia Abu Jamal
The war on pot, is a war that?s failed
A war that's fillin' up the nations jails
World war one, two, three and four

Chemical weapons, biological war
Bush war 1, and Bush war 2
They gotta a war for me, they gotta a war for you!

We can't stop it when the beat just drops!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop it when the rebel rock!

We can't stop until we hit those heights!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop because we love this life!

Dance to the new day
Sing to the new day, Rhyme to the new day
Transform hell into heaven God lives through,
Grab hold of today

Yesterday is over, tomorrow may be too late
Everything is one but the one is off balance
Music made for the dollar like soul and talent
Really ain't it all about a feeling you was havin'

As a child runnin' wild
Before the mind programmin' set in
Threatenin' your establishment
Get in this energy, lay back and sit

The next men wreckin', to the master's lips
Head spin breathren, get to askin' if
Where, when, Mr. President, ""What do you know?""
It's evident settin' in slow, ""How does it go?""

An unprecedented event is about to unfold
The devil can't stop, won't stop blockin' the globe
Fall in a cell here
Freedom come knockin' at the door

They try lockin' it though, but we about to explode
We got the firefly, tiger eye apocalypse flow
So deep in the bottom of your bottomless soul
Send mind darts flyin' out, without a pistol

Redesign lost minds got outta the cold
Bring order to a world that is outta control
""Truth"" you say, I say, ""How do I know?""

[Chorus]

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
If I was in Baghdad then I would rock Iraq

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
There is just one love so the planet we rock

New world days and new world nights
New world wrongs and new world rights
Putting new world funds in the new world banks
With the new world guns on the new world tanks

New world devils and new world gods
New world jails see the new worlds hard
New world names sing the new world songs
New world planes are the new world bombs
New world's flying, the new world's dying

Michael Franti & Spearhead,"If I could be the sun
I'd radiate like Africa and
Smile upon the world
Intergalactic love laughter and
If I were the rains, I'd wash away the whole world's pain and
Bring the gift of cool like ice cream trucks on sunny days and
If I was the earth I'd be like mountains bountiful
And if I were the sky so high, I'd be like wind invincible and
If I could be a seed, I would give birth to redwood trees and
If I were the trees, I'd generate the freshest air to breathe in

What I be, is what I be
Well, well, well, movin on!
Well, well, well, movin on!
Do you love someone? Do you love somebody?
Love that one!

If I could be the leaves, then like jade I would stay evergreen and
Spread my limbs out wide and pull love so close to me and
If I could the roots, I would dig deep like ancestry and
If were the fruits, you'd make the sweetest cherry pie from me and
If I could be the night, my moon replace all electric lights and
Magic music would transmit from outer space on satellites
If I myself could be the ocean, you would feel emotion all the time and
If I were the words, then everything that everybody said would rhyme

[Chorus]

If I could be sex my words would protect
I'd be in the lives of all who connect
What the heck, I'd make it so we all got selected
Pores would be dripping pure hot intellect and
The minds of the masses would all stay erect and
Then just for kicks, I'd mail out some checks
Addressed to those who sent their used latex in
Yes, that's what I would if I were sex
If I could be you, you could be me
I could be you, you could be me
I could walk a mile in your shoes.....
And you could walk a mile in my bare feet

They tellin you that you'll never see the horror

Wall street crime will never send you to the slammer
Tell all the children in the arms of their mommas

On a dark, cold and cloudy day. 
Reminded me on the side of the road, 
You'll find a light you'll find a friend you'll find a way. 
Well today I'm feelin' all broke down, 
I ain't got the faintest clue 'bout what to do, 
Can't comprehend the situation at hand, 
So I'll try my best just to get back home to you.

Keep on takin' bout it (yes I will.) 
Keep on singin' bout it (yes I will,) 
Keep on rainin' down (yes I will.) 

Yoo hoo hoo hoo, yoo hoo hoo 
Yoo hoo hoo hoo, yoo hoo hoo 

I believe that what you sing to the clouds, 
Will rain upon you when your sun has gone away, 
And I believe that what you dream to the moon, 
Will manifest before you rest another day. 
So stay strong, and sleep long, and when you need to 
Let the morning take you out on to today, hey hey, 
And when you find you're at the end of the road, 
Just lift your head up, spread your wings and fly away, come on y'all!

If you need some money, I got some that you can borrow
We dance until the sun come up and cast shadows
Right now, the tune reflects, lights out, we soon connect
We ride on lows and high
So hot that we sweat, so happy we cry
Wish bygones goodbye, thank god we's alive
With time on our side and this rhyme I provide
We smile while we slide, do I say goodbye?
We keep it rockin' like the sound of lion

Anyway that you can rise above

To be the last one to die for love

And anger fills our tears
What happen to the sun

But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

Every time I read the news
I'm always more confused
Tellin' me to choose
But there's only lies to choose from
And how many died today
How many lost their homes or shot a gun
Or a love one
What happen to our sons

The next minute gotcha fall on yer face

To smash the empire with my boom-box.

War on the land and war on the seas

One argument that none of us can hide, is the one that's ragin' down deep inside
Tryin' to make a point, or have the last word
But most the time people just tryin' to be heard

They say you got to chose your side and, when its done
Nobody right, nobody wrong
It ended in a great big fight and, when its done
Nobody right, nobody wrong

But how many people never eva broke a rule
And how many people tryin' to get their kids to school
And how many people prayin' they only find a job
And how many people are afraid of gettin' robbed
Whoa whoa, nobody knows
And whoa whoa, only God knows
Numbers escalate, wall street, crime rate
From the Baghdad streets, to my city by the bay

Hey they say you got to chose your side and, when its done
Nobody right, nobody wrong
It ended in a great big fight and, when its done
Nobody right, nobody wrong

And I say, can you say what you mean?
And can you mean what you mean what you say?
And can you say what you mean?
And can you mean what you mean what you say?
And can you say what you mean?
Every single day? Whoa, whoa, whoa

Reach out a hand to somebody who needs a hand.
And reach out a heart to somebody torn apart
Its hard, this livin', this life we've been given
Locked in your soul, or locked up in prison
Remember you have to reach high to be risen
The day you let go is the day you are forgiven

So they say you got to chose your side and, when its done
Nobody right, nobody wrong
Nobody right now
Nobody right, nobody wrong
Nobody right, nobody wrong
And I say, one man got a jet fighter, and the other got a song

Michael Franti & Spearhead,"We livin' in a mean time and an aggressive time
A painful time, a time where cynicism rots to the vine
In a time where violence blocks the summer shine
Lifetimes, go by in a flash
In search for love, in search for cash
Everybody want to be some fat tycoon
Everybody want to be on a tropic honeymoon
Nobody want to sing a little bit out of tune
Or be the backbone of a rebel platoon
It's too soon to step out of line
You might get laughed at you might get fined
But do you feel me when I say I feel pain everyday
When I see the way my friends gotta slave
And never get ahead of bills they gotta pay
No way no way!
Some make a living doing killing Colombian penicillin
Some are willing to play the villain they just chillin'
To pass the time, pass the information
Or pass the wine
Pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction 

[Chorus]
Bom-Bom, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station

Bom-Bom the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication! 

This is the dawning of our time I say it one more time
To emphasize the meaning of my rhyme
To rise above all the dirt and grime
Add the right spice at the right time
Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
Check our habitation are we a peace lovin' nation
Peace lovin' nation
I have a reasonable doubt I think I'll just spell it out
There's no need to scream or to shout
The N.R.A. just bought a man's soul
Then he jumps up and shouts gun control
The government says that killing's a sin
Unless you kill a murderer with a lethal syringe
So I ask again ""are we peace lover's then""
Some of them slang guns when they six years old
Some of them end up in some six foot hole
This whole damn place seems to, lost control
So I raise my voice before I lose my soul

[Chorus]

This is the way I'll express my feelings
Vibe revealed and revolved spinning on a record y'all
Try to confiscate take what I communicate with
It's ancient gift of the lip steady creating
Activating passing vocal vibrations to the blind plus the seeing
Human doesn't mean just being
Be coming don't believe it just belife it
Belongings or beloved rehearse it or recite it
While shining drop your guns and move your tongues
Battle motivation in no time lyrics come
Sometimes fun others run their mouth or away
My mind co beaming like an early sun ray
One day we'll get the picture and all combine
Less the talking bout mines is mine and become one mind
Every piece of the puzzle has its place
To build the piece of the puzzle called the human race 

Taking it long enough we crush the formal journalistic
Dyslexic critters talk backwards to rap words
I'm sure raising my hands with questions and demands
Statements and a plan with a map of the land

Through the valley of darkness or loneliness

I'll be the one to pick you up when you've had too much to drink

Tell me why do they come to die here

Tell me why did they load their guns here

Is the sun that is shinin' on you next to me
You got a little broken nail, got a hair outta place
You got a little bit of extra middle right around the waist
With all of them things I never ever hesitate
'Cause the thing about you baby is the smile on your face
I'm blowin' kisses at you girl and I hope they didn't miss
The way you move your body made it hard for them to hit you
I wish you would come a little closer
Rub a little closer

And I love the way you love me, never gettin' enough
I love the way you shake that little extra bit of butter
When I see you move your body, girl it makes my heart a flutter
When I see you dancin' on the living room floor, 
On the kitchen table better open up the door
Bring the party to the street 
Because the street will love it more
And if the people love the beat, 
Then the beat will love them more
With the music blastin', the people clappin', 
The speakers shakin', the kids'll take it

I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I've got to pay
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in

That's why so many people stand up and say

One love, one blood, one heart, one soul and one drum and only one rhythm. 
One child and all of them singin.

still just one moment, six billion people and all of them singing.

Pick up a chainsaw filled with desire, chop down a tree, set them on fire.

Do it for the love, not for the money
Not for the guns and not for the honeys
Do it ‘cause it makes you feel alive
Like the way we rockin’ on Saturday night
Do it for the love of it, do it for the smell of it
Do it for the joy and the taste and the hell of it
Do it ‘cause you love it and it makes no sense
Not yens or euros or dollars or cents

When I was a little, little boy I knew I’d grow up
To be somebody that my mama said would always show up
To work, to school and all that’s cool
But, following rules was never my strong suit, you know
I bought a guitar, a microphone too
Set out to do what I was born to do
And mama said something as I was walking out the door

[Chorus]
Do it for the love, not for the money
Not for the guns and not for the honeys
Do it ‘cause it makes you feel alive
Like the way we rockin’ on Saturday night
Do it for the love of it, do it for the smell of it
Do it for the joy and the taste and the hell of it
Do it ‘cause you love it and it makes no sense

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Just for the love of it

Life is never easy and you better know it
Sometimes it’s like the date you’re waiting for that doesn’t show up
You got to pay the rent, or else you owe it
And like a credit card, you know you better not blow it
And if you got beef with someone, let go it
And if you got love for someone, you better show it
Mama said this as I was walking out the door

Somebody told me don't stare at horizons
Unless you are ready to run
So let's save our money and buy a car
So we can we can drive all the way across America

We gonna keep on burnin' till the night is gone

Drinking 40s and rolling up some sticky icky
Under the stars or maybe even Mars
Muscle cars are smoking up the boulevard
You look pretty out of the city
You said you love me and there's no place you wanna go alone

Just a little more time for me
Just a little more time that we could be together
We go on and on, and on and on [x2]
We leave it behind but we’re still moving on and on

I remember when we use to play hopscotch out on the sidewalk
I would draw your picture there with my white chalk
Every day we’d ride bikes home through the schoolyard
We would eat, sleep, work just so we could play hard
Tired of calling mom saying “please come get me”
Traded in my bike for a beat up Chevy
Pops was home drinkin’
I was home dreamin’
And the years fly by like, boom!

We go on and on, and on and on [x2]
We leave it behind but we’re still moving on

It just goes on and on, and on and on

We leave it behind but we’re still moving on
Ain’t life like that, it just goes on

I remember rolling in my ride to the White Stripes concert
Climbing in the back seat
Rolling up your short skirt
Steamed up windows
Then we graduated
Said good-bye to the town that we hated
Life gets harder every single day
And when you fall down, that’s the rent that you pay
We used to say forever
Now we say remember
Look at all the bad and good we’ve seen together
I’m sorry that I lost you
Happy that I had you
My heart still beats like, boom!

Simple as this, boom!

I read the news of the day, just as it's coming down
I do my best not to let it get me down
I try to keep my head up, but is Babylon
This world's in crisis, we try to fight it, this changing climate
With scientists and politicians divided by it
So many ways we could solve it but they would never sign it
This mountains tumbling down, but still we try to climb it
It's in the Torah, Quran and in the Bible
Love is the message for some how we turn to rivals
It's come to people always picking up their rifles
Another school getting shot up homicidal

Some people tryna look fly, some people tryna get high
Some people losing their mind, some people tryna get by
And when you look in my eyes, you see the sign of the times
We all looking for the same thing

But what if this song's number one
Would it mean that love had won?
Would it mean that the world was saved?
And no guns are being drawn today?
What if everybody had a job?
And nobody had to break a law?
What if everyone could say
That it's good to be alive today (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is it good to be alive today (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is it good to be alive today (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is it good to be alive today (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Like help is on its way but now they only think of violence
Another youth in the streets and police is in a conflict
And now they hear the guns click, yo
Ebola crisis and ISIS is taking heads off
A drone is bombing a village and now the kids all
Signing up to be soldiers, but they all willing now
To do the killing now, now are you willing now?
Some politicians out there making up some problems
And tryna tell the people that they can solve them
With TV shows and soundbites and quotes
But everybody knows that it's all about the cash flow
They telling you and me, they're making progress
But tell it to the millions of jobless
It's like a players club with billions of dollars

Would it mean that love had won?
Would it mean that the world was saved?
And no guns are being drawn today?
What if everybody had a job?
And nobody had to break a law?
What if everyone could say
That it's good to be alive today (oh, oh, oh, oh)

In and out up and down in this life what a crazy road
It's been a long time that I shoulda said what I tell you now
That I got faith in you
And I believe in you
So I say

In the dark of the night in the hotel when you're alone
In the middle of the city where nobody cares to know
On the top of the town in the glimmer of the shining lights
You just shine on now
You just shine on now

And I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I'll feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
And I can't make you love me
If you don't

Michael Giacchino,"Les rêves des amoureux sont comme le bon vin
Ils donnent de la joie ou bien du chagrin
Affaibli par la faim je suis malheureux
Volant en chemin tout ce que je peux
Car rien n'est gratuit dans la vie

L'espoir est un plat bien trop vite consommé
À sauter les repas je suis habitué
Un voleur solitaire est triste à nourrir
À un je suis amer je ne peux réussir
Car rien n'est gratuit dans la vie

Jamais on ne redira
Que la course aux étoiles, ça n'est pas pour moi
Laissez-moi vous émerveiller et prendre mon envol
Nous allons enfin nous régaler

La fête va enfin commencer
Sortez les bouteilles, finis les ennuis
Je dresse la table, de ma nouvelle vie
Je suis heureux à l'idée de ce nouveau destin
Une vie à me cacher et puis libre enfin
Le festin est sur mon chemin

Une vie à me cacher et puis libre enfin
Le festin est sur mon chemin",Le  Festin,2007
Michael Giacchino,"I messed up tonight
I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again

They fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it won

I won't give up, no I won't give in

You filled your heart with love
Baby you've done enough that cut your breath
Don't beat yourself up
Don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last but we did our best

I won't give up, no I won't give in
Till I reach the end

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The words are true

Michael Gira,"Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two, puts some people on the streets

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends scream, “Let me out”
Pray tomorrow, gets me higher
Pressure on the people, people on the streets

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on the streets, people on the streets

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends scream, “Let me out”
Pray tomorrow, gets me high, high, high

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking
Why can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for the people
On the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves, this is our last dance
This is our last dance, this is ourselves

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you,
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again.

Is another girl better than me

Und ahnt, dass wir in sorge sind,
Doch er weiß auch wir sind alle blind

Lass dich retten, wenn der Morgen anbricht
Lass dir sagen es ist Land in Sicht
Wir wurden so oft gewarnt
Ich sag Dir Babylon ist enttarnt
Als die, die unsere Zukunft plant
Und die, die ihr Ende nicht ahnt

Was willst du sehen? Feuer vom Himmel?
Noch vor hundert Jahren war der Himmel nicht Feuerrot
Was willst Du sehen? Jesus auf einem Schimmel?
Er ist für unser Leben gestorben und am Kreuz hängt der Tod

Es muss nicht so weit kommen, wie es kommen wird
Doch ich weiß auch, dass seine Schrift sich niemals irrt
Man liest sie und ist so leicht verwirrt
Doch es scheint als hätten wir uns im Himmel verirrt","Medley: Wer Weiß Schon, Was Der Morgenn Bringt/Ich Lass Sie Sterben",2003
Michael Higgins,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

For too soon the summer sun, will be in a winter sleep

Inside your winter coat
But leave your troubles behind, now
You wrap yourself in a ball
Then hide away from it all

Ein Mann
Der geboren wurde
Um wie ein wildes Tier gejagt zu werden
Weil er arm war und sich nicht wehren konnte
Aber er gab sich mit seinem Schicksal nicht zufrieden
Und heute wurde seine Ehre wieder hergestellt..
Er war 19 und arm und verurteilt zum Tod
Dabei wußten alle
Der Schuldige war nicht El Lute.
Man begnadigte ihn
Er bekam lebenslang
Er träumte von Flucht und ließ nichts unversucht
Bis er schließlich entkam
Damit fing die Jagd an - nach El Lute.
Er hat nie das Licht der Sonne gesehn
Sie nannten ihn El Lute.
Was er wollte
War nur ein Zuhaus und mehr Brot
Und ein Ende von Hunger und Not.
Aber Spanien war damals kein Land
Für einen wie El Lute
Doch weil er für das Recht aller Rechtlosen stand
Waren sie für El Lute.
Und es sprach sich herum
Daß es nicht um El Lute nur ging.
Hier war einer wie sie
Und er beugte sich nie
Ihre Hoffnung
Sie stieg
Denn sein Sieg war ihr Sieg
Denn sein Sieg war ihr Sieg.
Auf und ab durch das Land ging die endlose Jagd
Wo immer er war
überall hing das Bild von El Lute.
Er war wie Robin Hood
Und es ging lange gut
Dann schloß sich die Falle
Das Ende schien nah
Doch ein Wunder geschah -
In dem sonnigen Land - von El Lute.
Er hat nie das Licht der Sonne gesehn
Sie nannten ihn El Lute.
Was er wollte
War nur ein Zuhaus und mehr Brot
Und ein Ende von Hunger und Not
Und es kam ein neuer Morgen ins Land
Er kam auch für El Lute
Denn die Feiheit
Die dort für die Menschen heut gilt
Sie gilt auch für El Lute.
Er hat nie das Licht der Sonne gesehn
Sie nannten ihn El Lute.
Was er wollte

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Michael Hutchence,"They came from the second city
Where the screams came unattached
Addiction was the latest style
In the faces they could not match
There was a blue beat playing
On the radio left behind
And a man selling lies as truth
Like a king who was loved too much

They made a mess of your only child
Her innocence was not lost
While the judge and jury took their dime
They counted the miles and laughed

Make way for the way we are
The fever still burns though the king is gone

Fever comes to the innocent
It can make you mad and free
But you never find a scrap of love
If you don't want to feel the heat

A million flames are lickin'
They lie like dogs at your feet
Waitin' for the words of wisdom
From the mouths of the bittersweet

In the valley of indiscretion
Where fear plays the piper's tune
The heroes are the ones who tell the truth
And break the rules with the courage of love

Fever still burns though the king is gone
Make way for the way we are

Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a little prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

Get up, and rock it to the rhythm

We can set all our senses reeling

You know I got the hots tonight
Tonight girl

Baby the love that is waiting inside you baby
Show me the passion and feel when I'm by your side
This is the time to discover the dream we make girl
Girl can you feel it
Time of your life

I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)
 
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

Who left my heart in pieces

Sometimes I can hear her crying here
And I can hear her calling me.

It tells you never be afraid
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow

My friend, my someone in the dark, was you

Prepare that utter shame
To just be called a part of God

While growing, still a child

Wonder if she's gone to stay

Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay

And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around

Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy

If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best

Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love

To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'

Maybe you and I can't do great things

When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch

Two hearts say goodbye

One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up

That's what love is made of

Not set, the paceful style

Oh, love think wavely me as my tears
I'll find the way to sell my clothes
Avoiding ships a fuss

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I dare not to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else

Shall follow the feel of constant care)

I'll be a man the way
To face whatever force my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just recall the part of guide

A man and a woman's youngest son
Who are growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...

Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was high-top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know, I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet Magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, ah
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side, I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her

They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy has turned to pain

You won't live a quiet life

So don't be feelin' no pain! 
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 

I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"" ? 
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move!

Only the strong survive

You won't live a quiet life

Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes

You can be a winner if you keep the faith

Straighten out yourself and get your mind on track
Dust off your butt and get your self-respect back

Take it like you want it but you got to keep the faith

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place

And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare

Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love

Do you remember
How we used to talk
(Ya know)
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time

(Piano intro)

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you mold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

(Carry)
(Carry me boldly)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there)

(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me)
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)

(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
(Show me you care)

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Need me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?

In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence

Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow

I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart",Will You Be There (Reprise),1995
Michael Jackson,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?

Like fantastical stories to share

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

And mother always told me be careful of who you love

But the kid is not my son

But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I,
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

Michael Jackson,"Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there

She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair",Little Susie,1995

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference

My favorite winter coat

I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see

Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust

They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money

So you go to church
Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd

They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money

You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but

If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it

You kill for the money
Do or dare

Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers

If you give it with guilt

If it's taking a chance

To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself

Michael Jackson,"Tired of injustice, tired of the scheme
Life is disgustin' so what does it mean, Debbie
You kick to me down I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds the whole system sucks, Debbie

Peek in the shadow, I come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but ya I care about mine
I've got to get stronger and I won't give up the fight

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

Tired of tellin' the story your way
It's causin' confusion you think it's okay, Debbie
Keep changin' the rules while I playin' the game
I can't take it much longer I think I might go insane

With such confusions don't make me wanna scream, baby

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening, it's all injustice

Baby, with such illusions don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it, no

Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream

I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For I am here with you (I am here with you)

Michael Jackson,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one will dance on the floor in the round
 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
 
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)
 
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
 
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

There's a goul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs

Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you want to see
It's you who's haunting me
You're warning me
To be the stranger
In your life

Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast
You visualized
And if you want to see
Eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eyes

Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

There's a creak behind the door

But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes

A haunting ghostly treat
The foolish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the light

But if you came to see
The truth the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart

So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you
So tell me is it scary for you, baby
So tell me is it crazy for you, baby
Am I scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya

Masquerade the heart
Is the height of haunting souls
Just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Am I scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
So tell me am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for ya, baby
Is is scary for ya, baby

Michael Jackson,"Saturday night at eight o'clock 
I know where I'm gonna go, 
I'm gonna pick my baby up,
And take her to the picture show.
Ev'rybody in the neighborhood 
Is dressin' up to be there too, 
And we're gonna be a ball 
Just like we always do. 
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby i
n the last row in the balcony?
 
There's Technicolor and Cinemascope, 
A cast out a Holly wood, 
And the popcorn from the candy store, 
Makes it all seem twice as good. 
There's alway lots of pretty girls 
With figures they don't try to hide,
But they never can compare  
To the girl sittin' by my side.
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?
 
Movies are better than ever, 
And just as dark as before, 
And Saturday night when you're with your baby,
Who could ask for anything more?

Look into my eyes and hold me close
And this is what you'd say

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

The pleasant dreams we shared
Made our love stronger with each day
And the fears that haunted me
Seemed like a million miles away.

Are all we're thinking of
We're so in love
We're thinking of.

Some insecurities 
About the way I feel 
Where I want to be 

Boy, you know it's with you 
No one can do 
The things you do to me 
Never to be mistaken 

Long as it's love we're making 
There'll be no hesitating, you and me. 
That's the way it will be 
And I won't leave your side 
You should know... 

[Chorus:]
Love will be right here, be right here 
Right here, be right here 
(Don't you have no) No fear, have no fear 
(Don't shed) no tears, love is here 

True love some don't believe in 
That's just what I'm giving 
I'm gonna keep it strong 
I'll be holding on to you. 

No on can do me like you do, it's true 
Sure as the sun is shining 
Our love will keep on climbing 
There's gonna be some rain, gonna be some pain 

But as long as I know 
Boy, time will show 
Our love will grow, and I know... 

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Won't let go. You should know this thing is real 
No questions, just listen to you heart and 
Love will be right... 

[Rap-Taj] 
Baby, what's the problem 
It's seems like we're having trouble 
You don't seem to understand 
The life I lead ain't double 

My heart belongs to you, and only you 
And you know it's true 
A phony imitation just won't do 
Relax your mind 

I'm not the kind who runs around 
And wastes time, other fine brothers just don't compare 
I'll be there, I swear, far or near, have no fear 
I don't care, you can count on me, I'm right here

when your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is reach for the truth, the truth

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

Michael Jackson,"Don't walk away
See I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away
Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

See now why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we're going
Everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't want to walk away
Now why
All my dreams are broken
Don't know where we're going
Everything begins to set us free
Can't you see, I don't want to walk away

If you go, I won't forget you girl
Can't you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There' nothing left to do
Don't walk away",Don't Walk Away,2001

She's a heartbreaker 

She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
Ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

Stop being without you

And start being without you

And stop talkin' about you

She will say I was the man that got away

It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were

I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do

You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy

Cause you cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold

To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard

But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away

Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell my why

But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, ""I love you.""",Speechless,2001

Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introducing
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.

You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's â??cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I know just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me

[Chorus]

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case 
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in tow places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear.

What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.

That you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through,
I'm still around

Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Now you can't stop me even thought you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
IÂ´m steady laughin', while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake

And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me

Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
Baby please, 'cause it's not worth it

You came into my life
And it's so funny
How you made everything right
And now you're saying to me
Something ain't right
What did I do?
Did I hurt you?
Baby can you tell me
How to dry your eyes
But let me say
I never meant to make you cry
If anything I meant to
Be right by your side
How did I go wrong?
When my love was strong
And all I ever wanted was you

If I can ease the pain

That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you

Don't say goodbye, this can't be it

You mean the world to me
And all I do is try to give you all of me
I never do anything that wouldn't be pleasing to you
I never knew that you were hurting
And I'll take the blame for anything that I've done
That has caused you pain
I never meant to hurt you in any way
So this day, I wanna say
Baby please forgive me

If I can ease the pain
Whatever it takes to
That is what I'll do
Why do you feel this way
Baby you don't have to
'Cause I am here for you

Who promise fortune and fame

Say that I'm alright

She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone

Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine

She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart

In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear od dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life

Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And now you're gunna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance

And it seemed that everything
Was on my side

It seemed to me like it was love and true romance
And now she's got to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Look who took you under

Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife

Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right

Susie got your number

Look who took you under

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Like numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe its because we're so versatile
Style, profile I said
It always brings me back when I hear, ""ooh child""
From The Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon to the very last mile
Well if you battle me I feel reviled
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gaul, you've got guile
If you step to me I'm going to rap full file
If you want to battle you're in denial
Comin' from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead with my rhymes I'll trial
Cast you off into exile

When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
Well I have to keep it going keep it going full steam
To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean
With the tough guy style I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme
Mario see likes to keep it clean
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rappin', cause that's my dream

Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
Your rhymes are spread just like a pox
Cause the music is loud like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gets biz on the crops
Beastie Boys known to let the beat
""MMM, D-are-are-rop!""
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If I rap soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack DJ AD Rock!
If you try to knock me you'll get mopped
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees start shakin' and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One

But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice
Do think Twice

She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Til Three
Then She Looked At Me
She Showed A Photo Of A Baby Crying
His Eyes Looked Like Mine
Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby

And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
She Came And Stood Right By Me
Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

Keep it in the closet

And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight 
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it

As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike

You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam 
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand 
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes 
And hope that this is just imagination

You hear the creature creepin' up behind

To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love

Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity

This girl I could not trust

Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword

And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light 
From one more violent crime 
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue 
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die 
Did god say that you you could decide ?
You saw he didn't run 
And then my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village 
Within a distant land
Lies a cool boy with his broken toy 
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking 
His father grabs his hand
Screaming crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why 
Why his mother had to die
Why did these soldiers come here for ? 
If they're for peace why is there war ? 
Did god say that they could decide 
Who will live and who will die ?
All my mama ever did 
Was try to take care of her kids
When innocence is standing by 
Watching people loosing lives
It seem as if we have no voice 
It's time for us to make a choice

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue

Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.

In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood

Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now

And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

When things would hurt you

I am forever, I am forever

You are the sun that lights summer sky,
When things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back,
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you

Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Look within your heart then ask,

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
(Starting with me!)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
(If you want to make the world a better place)

(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your, your mind!
(Then you close your, mind!)
That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man,
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know, that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
(Ooh)
Oh no, no no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Come on!
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it,
Yourself!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've got to make that change, today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself
Brother
Hoo!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know I've got to get
That man, that man

(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move! Come on!
Come on!
You got to

Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Aw!
(Yeah! Make that change!)
Gonna make that change

Come on!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know it

Michael Jackson,"Live and sin 
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
 
Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can`t convince this girl there ain`t no other 
 
Someone`s evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile`s trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He`s been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue, 
Every girl that I knew 
And my baby said love is through 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel

This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world
I'll feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes for sure
It is real

And it feels as though I've seen your face one thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with you eyes
But you say you're gonna leave it for yourself
Oh
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand

This is it
I can say
I'm the light of your world
Run away
We can feel
This is real
Every time I'm in love that I feel

And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me that you don't want me hanging around
Many times wanna do it here before
Oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand

This is it
I can feel
I'm to light up the world
This is real
Feel my song
We can say
And I tell you can feel that way

And I feels as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you saw my face yourself
And you said want to go with you on a while
And I know that it's really for myself
Oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on please dear understand

Come on dear please understand

Michael Jackson,"There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
There must be more that needs the light
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying see'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
A living hope for a world fill with love
And waking up, just making noise

There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world fill with love
There must be more to life, than this

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this",There Must Be More to Life Than This [William Orbit Mix],2014
