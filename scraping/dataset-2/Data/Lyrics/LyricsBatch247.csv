Big blue, hot and skinny shoot
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop ugh
Play with me, see what the screamy do
My canary shoe,
High beems pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your family dues
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble boots
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots gettin' fuckin' loot
My top down, I'm flashing on 'em
I'm passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on 'em
The ratchet on him, pay my dues, now it's back to ballin'
The raps a boring dead man, I dip the casket for 'em
I'm back performing, I bag 'em
Break their back, don't call 'em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning

So I'ma be at least about an hour late
I'm so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Tody Chester with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said ""hey 'Ye""
I said ""Yes Bitch""
Damn I'm only asking you a question
I met this milf at the all star getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I'm a rock star, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas don't take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic'd it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I plutonic'd it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes homie I'm pyjama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I'm only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said ""it's free"", I said wowzers!

Fabolous,"We're a hurricane
So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same
And me too

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
The way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me, oh
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
'Cause we got
Crazy love, oh yeah

I'm intelligent
I'm not stupid
Not at all, no, no, no
But my common sense
When it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
In the way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
You and me got
Crazy love, oh yeah

I walk into where you was at then my phone calls get a who is that
I told her that I worry that we won't last
She told me you need to worry when I don't ask
See that's the crazy love I be talking bout
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking bout
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out
Then I see that fat ass when you walking out
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye-bye
Outfit look crazy on her you my lady gaga
But you wanna start it first and get the last word
You wanna lock me down and get the password
Damn I wanna spray don't use juice
So in the bedroom I got a few screws loose
The head's coo-coo back-shots psycho
Hit it from the back hard hope you got Geico

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
You and me got
Crazy love, oh yeah",Crazy Love,2010
Fabolous,"These niggas losing their minds
You find that there's no reward
They say they already home
It's really clear they abroad
They sound like they boxed in
It's not just where they record
There's a cost to be the boss they can't clearly afford
Swear to the Lord, there's guns like the audience
You put on a show, my forty clearly applauds
Sittin' fifth row, I might appear to be bored
Plotting on a Kanye, but screaming where's my award
Ballin' out of control, never won an ESPY
Bout to buy a black ghost and call that shit SP
Flow outta this World, I'm coming for my Moon man
You niggas slide back like that walkin' on the moon dance
No glitter glean, handgun with a beam
Have some boys follow you, street fam, twitter team
Like you could fuck with me
Oh did it seem, Dr King and Def Jam ain't the only ones with a dream
I'm a grown ass man, this kid a teen
You're a spoof of me like if hip hop did a scream
Audi coupe looking good so I went and copped it
Got that TT poppin' like a trending topic
My ride is matte black
My pride is that jack
It might get ya dog shot, even a cat smacked
Anyway though, styles don't apply to me
Jeff Goldblum couldn't be more fly to me
Shorty say right after the suck fuck proof
You hit it on the head girl, duck duck goose
You shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce
Break em off and leave it
You seen my fucked up tooth
It's fucka bitch, there's more fish in the aquarium
I rarely hear no, like when niggas ask you to marry them
There's no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from
Funeral fab, I'm just here to bury them

Reporting live from the beacon
Booth tired from the beatin'
Had foreplay all day
Prepin' the beatin' the mic for a threesome
With my vocal's bi-coastal, speakin' til their eyes totaled
Mr wi-fi, out a franchise go to
Magic, standby local's
Watch the track bust once I show my dick size to the pro-tools
I teach you how to have models screaming get behind me
E-pills and maybach's ain't gon matter if your tip is tiny
Nevermind me, we could get knee deep in the beef
Seek me with the heat but you'll need more to keep me on a leash
Here's a cc for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
Invest in Rockports and be easy on your feet
Give a few hammers, a few semi's and a few snubs to a few crips,
Couple vampire's and true bloods
Gambling in casino's, have a hundred handing me my c-notes
The modern day gambino
I'm careful every step I take
You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
That'd be the last mistake you ever make
Me I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade
Like groceries when I'm shooting at fags
Make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred
Dudes is falling off doing all they can to save it
But everybody's run stops ask Brandon Jacobs
What y'all call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blatt at me that'd equal more casualties
Abort the strategy
Or get attacked with that Duracell they put in your back
Now that's assault and battery
You can keep the bitching to yourself
There's beams on every burner
These lasers, a petition wouldn't help!
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss?
Where I'm from, better be careful when you drive that whip
Niggas put they life at risk for pies that flip
In my town Ben Affleck wouldn't try that shit
And if he did he'd get turned around burnt down
Tell 'em new jacks it'll be a while fore they eligible to earn the crown

Acid out the baggie
This is more than dope
Flawless flow
Fucking off a sign every horoscope to wore my robes
Strappin' up the corner cold, critical
Unquestioned, my opponents know
I shoot like Capone, watch me own the show
Chromatose, toasted, getting money while I roam the coast
Stones and boats, mansions, homes, and hopes
I deserve 'em both, overdose
Time to earn my votes, watch me turn the volts
Voltage through a hater, this electric chair, danger
Yeah, I see ya
Now make way fore it turn to diarrhea
Hear a microphone will give you 3 of everything I wear yeah
Models by the pair, swear, bottles, private Lear, steer
Style that's outta here, rare, thousands by the chair, square
Sleep with me, you came here, war with me is scary
Get beat silly tryna lamp here, better bring your theory heat
I got a drop damp here, niggas try me barely
No one breathes, I need an ants ear, precious necessary
Got my mind on the cheddar kill my haters together
Bury em in abundance and starve there family's stomach's
Paper come in my thumbage, brand new fifties and hundreds
On point, just like the drum is
I'm warning them baby mothers
Got the hunger of a broke rapper
Kill you while I'm rollin' up then smoke after
Catch you at your show, snatch ya, empty out the dough faster
Bentley off the scene, magnum Mo splasher, four packer
Southside nigga spittin' coke at ya!

This is for the fronters and the naysayers
I'm about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
They say I'm out of my league on this one
So when I get done I want you to cut your fuckin' ears off, Twitpic 'em!
Lord, I want you to leave this vicinity
You gon be around here bout long as Justin Bieber's virginity
This is Jesus identity, mixed with weed
Hennessey, Kennedy, King
Mixed with a kill or be killed, killer regime
Ill as you seen, switch
Y'all write all that hard shit then you fall right off, it's horrible
My oracle is all I offer, so before I borrow
You won't be here tomorrow flow
Sorry, I will probably adios my body with somebody toast
This shit just practice
Sickest rapping Baptist
Kill your pastor, steal your Chapstick
After that make you kiss a cactus
Then, take your hoe, make the hoe give the whole clique fellatio
Everyone, that wasn't the whole entourage on HBO
Then after that, I tell her, I can't do much with you, shawty!
I just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire buffy the body!
Don't call us if the bitches ain't flawless
If they are then we can hang like Aretha Franklin bra-less
The drunk me can box like the sober you
The sober me be more nervous than Waka Flocka in the voting booth
We beef like being deep and dumping K's
You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist
Y'all get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
My feng shui is a pump in the desert
You'll come up shorter than an Asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
While my wolf pack looks for strippers and cocaine
Niggas snitching, it's a shame
We call em male tattlers
Fiends touching they noses more than URL battlers
It's hard to spit saliva when you spit fire
So I'll just pour sugar in your gas tank
Put a banana in your tailpipe
Ah ha, so the car can fit the driver",Remember the Titans,2010

Now let me take you to a place far beyond 
In a whole 'nother galaxy 
Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality 
Melt your imagination and mold it into reality 
Your heart's my art gallery, girl 
Can you feel the pictures that I painted 
'cause all of them are related, like a mother to a son 
But none of them overrated 
There no others, you the one 
Our destiny is to make it 
Gotta thank you just for sharing your world 
Its so real, an inspiration for no reason 
But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangeable 
The thought is sensational, its perfect bliss 
I'm ready to take the milky way to your Hershey's kiss 
You know my tongue's got batteries in it 
The bedroom, we lose calories in it and start families in it 
And don't worry 'cause the situation's under control 
So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul (Luda)..

Take me I'm yours, shawty 
As we rock to the left, rock to the right 
Lend me your body and we'll rock it all night 
Don't leave us on this floor, shawty

Tell the niggas holla back, tell your girls goodnight..

I look in my pocket and I see dead people
One, two, three, body count
One, two, three, everybody count
One, two, three, body count
I check my other pocket more bodies found

More bodies I'm back for more bodies
The competition is a skinny bitch nobody
I'm running and I know's it
That's why I'm so snotty
You little boys sit yo ass down, no potty

I see dead people
I see dead people
I look in my pocket and I see dead people
One, two, three, body count
I check my other pocket more bodies found

Let's keep it a hundred
That's word to Ben Frank
Money's what you can count on when your friends ain't
Grass green over here
Green like the kush's
I got presidents in my jeans like the Bushes
We don't chase money 
we chase dreams
Rub this money in your face, face cream
Doctors say I have a problem
I see nothing but the bread
Told me close my eyes ""what you see""
Y'all know what I said!

[Chorus]

And if I go make sure the family gets the cash
And at my funeral there's only one wish I ask
Give the haters a chance to see me cause this they last
Turn me over one by one let them kiss my ass
I see dead people
I see dead people
Pocket full of ego, big head people
One two three body count rising
Now everybody got their hand out fucking Heisman
Your boy just convinced her that she gorgeous
Must have took a couple thousand of them Georges
They call me funeral they call us broad'trish
Face on point they should call us swordfish
He got a gang of money
You can't stop his drive
He in the blue six screaming out, stop it five
Black out jewelry, you still see it though
I make a movie in the club, got it see it yo

Been chasing her for two days, first forty eight
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutie pie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louis Vuitton shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe'icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone four, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron
When them other hos call I hand her the phone
And she hand 'em the tone

Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin' with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution

Now I see who all these hating girls be talkin' shit bout
From the front looking like she got some ass probably
They say that's a sign girl ass-trology
Tight denim with them little rips in 'em
Wait in line jeans, take a minute to get in 'em
BBD say you poison well I want some of that venom girl, girl

Lotta chicks off in this club and you the baddest in this bitch
Oh, look at what you wearing girl
The club owner should pay you whenever you make an appearance
And you got me hooked, I might try not to look
But I keep staring
Come out to my city see, I run that bitch like errands oh
Grown as hell I don't care to choose
Who's coming, you, her and you
Roll this up, after you hit it once, you'll need a parachute
To tell the truth I'm a tear the roof
Out that motherfucker nail it too
Loud pipes, hear the coupe, vroom, got stripes like a general
You know I'm tryna get into you

Now you the baddest that I've seen in the club all night
Girl, your booty had me stuck like a drug all night
Damn, girl I really wanna put it on you like a coaster,
Love how you moving over there but I really want you closer
Let get drunk off this Moscato, do it like there's no tomorrow
Wake up and if it's up we'll do it like there's no tomorrow
Jump on it, I want it, he on it, bone it
Whenever she want it
R-O-S-C-O-E, we dismantling every component
Girl you the one, too bad I'm not a jumper?
She love the way the rapper tastes, too bad I'm not a sucker
She call me when she need it
And I'm a come running to feed that appetite I do it anyway she want it

From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me

Throw down in the kitchen, might need better then moms
Wake me up with some head, ain't no better alarm
Move in by myself, a force when we together
I was sick of these n****s, of course she made me better
I put her in her position others never could be in
Couple racks for her shoes but she never been skiing
Kind you never be seeing, everything European

Lift weights I pound up in it
Hit the walls I climb up in it
Applause need a round up in it
Ever lost I get found up in it
I'm a boss and my lady floss when I take her down in rodeo
You would think they was on pay roll
They don't close the store till I say so
And the car I'm riding is payed for

When you step outside n****s know you fine but they know you mine

But I ain't try to hurt her, ‘cause I've always been the best
At making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I'm a fan of her talent, so I've always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn't reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn't reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands

That’s flip flops, that’s Americana, that’s Hilfiger
Yacht masters at the yacht party, sitting at the dock is a drop 'rari
That’s pole position with a joystick, that’s push a button that’s like Atari
Raising the bar, no parallel, so many horses, carousel
How we roll out like a caravan, ghost in the snow, see Carol Ann
Maryland, tags on it, heroine, bags on it
Hermes, throw pillows, Missoni couch and it clash on it
Take a look in my viewfinder and see seven figures and two commas
I see bad bitches, see blue diamonds, I see-saws, I two time em'
Gigolo, juggle hoes, jigsaw, I puzzle those
Cross words, cross birds, I cross country with a couple those

The life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting

When the sun is out we runs about
Let the world see what these hunneds' about
Ain’t seen this since the one was out
With Jay, Pimp C, and Bun
We out here, still pimping that big
Looking that jig, someone go call hype Willie
We need slow mo, more rolls more
Niggas is drunk and type silly
We dancing like Dame, holding up chains
Got PMBs on a big ass boat on molly, rolling up Jane
This life is so exciting, that money be so inviting
So fuck what they're indicting, tell my lawyers keep on fighting

For the life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting

What was more than most had so I never got ridiculed
This was '89, matter fact it was '90
Crack was already huge, the streets start getting grimey
But I wasn't in that world then
I'm 13, all I'm thinkin' bout is Nike's, basketball and my girlfriend
Yeah, who at the time was Tia Williams
And she had no idea that one day I would see a million
This is a teengae love, few months but we was buildin'
She was grown, I was the man but we was children
She had ass though, I mean for her age or whatever
She wore my ring some times like we engaged or whatever
And this the ""No, you hang up first"" dial tone era
Your mom's pick up and say ""Hang up my house phone"" era
And I hated that, how you gon' scream in my baby ear
That pretty lil' brown skin girl with the baby hair
As we was going steady, my sex drive was so Andretti
She a virgin but I feel like it's time, I know she ready
He ain't got much experience, but she don't know that
That boy's chance is coming up, I hope he don't blow that
I'm waiting for the opportunity, mama at work
Start with a kiss, then I'm in her shirt, next I'm in her skirt
You know that always heard that the first time gonna hurt
That's what she heard from her cousin, 'lied and told her it doesn't
And so to me, it's just a matter of time
That Tia gon' give it up to me and that'll be mine
But one day I was absent, I came back to school
Learned that, I left the man but I came back the fool
They said that ""Tia did some bullshit, I mean did y'all speak?""
She cut school, lost her virginity, some kid named Khalif
An I'm stuck... Like what the fuck?
I ain't hear that my girl did what?
But had to act like I ain't care
Felt like I wanted to cry, but nah I ain't tear
That first time I learned that trust ain't a must if I ain't there
And of course we broke up, she moved on, I did the same
I ended up with some next girl, forget her name
Which probably isn't right, cause we used to get along
But I remember Tia, cause she did me wrong

Reminiscing on our past days
Back before a nigga went cold
Back before a nigga sold his soul
The grass is way greener, on the other side
The cash is way greener, over here where I reside
Soon as the summer come around I'm gon' make sure you see me
Said I'ma make sure you see me
But for now

Shouldn't you be
Gone
Gone for the winter

Hit the scene sippin' lean, Give a fuck 'bout what you

Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
My ears to the streets, I hear your ass when you mumble
They say you can't do it cause the last nigga fumble
As soon as you make it out, you get asked to be humble, waah
Head high, middle finger higher
My youngin' don't rap but that little nigga fire
Like Ray Allen in game 6, when James missed
Then Bosh tapped it to him
You know what had happened to 'em, swish
It's all about a swish
Know a nigga who would, you ain't even gotta wish
It's more in the sea and I done had a lot of fish
How she act when you ain't up will tell a lot about a bitch
Cause eagles don't fly with pigeons, they way higher
All wings flap but you gotta stay flyer
Niggas broke as a joke, sitting laughin' together
I started cheesin' after I turned my craft into chedder
I ran from the worst, chasing after the better
Life is a bitch, I knew right after I met her
So what you have-nots know about having knots?
Love for a hater only thing I haven't got

Shouldn't you be

You know I get around baby, that's just how the life be
I like a couple towns but you know my city wifey
And I ain't spent a month at home, still be in my comfort zone
Fuck asking for a seat, you gotta come for thrones
Kings don't speak English we speak Kinglish
I scoop a chick from Queensbridge, she coming back a Queen bitch
Think BIG and Kim, not think bigger than them
Everybody wanna shine, gotta give these niggas a gym
Never stressed of lil' things, like a hater
That's something that comes when you eatin', like a waiter
Live from the 718
It's the kid that always get the shoes early, I never run late
You see I big up the flows, everyword is capital
I killed all them hoes, I'm the murder capital
I'm the name they bring up that they think their bird is flappin' to
You the name that usually comes behind, ""word what happened to""
Hah, y'all old washed niggas
Was the man now your all no washed nigga
That's why I'm on one like old Goerge Wash nigga

Put it to your mouth just like Cutti did to Anthony
I tried to a friend mother fucker, you under handed me
Lucky this is personal and God got a plan for me
Cause I handle my business, never let my business handle me
Saying your name could do more for you than it can for me
You give niggas and they forget your philanthropy
You don't have a penny till your name Anfernee
Don't ever bite the hand that feed you and then stick out your hand for me
We don't base, we throw niggas in the truck for real
Chase you out the hood, make you live with uncle Phil
Champagne every night, I done drunk a mil
Yeah, now that's money wasted
But now it's kinda hard for me to buy Ace
'Specially when I just seen Hov buy Ace
Moves, time to make moves
No more jab steps, those is fake moves
Gotta make it happen, no time for what may work
My plan B's another way to make my plan A work
I dot the job myself and I'm still boss
You was in a win-win and you still lost

Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (Never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac (Jada)
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back
Either way I ain't never evil
Why you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em
My heart stops, but the words are forever breathing
You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason

First thing first don't ever play yourself (Ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (Never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (It's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (Swish)

Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful

Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket

Don't you ever play yourself

I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out

Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom, oh please, or don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
'Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the Sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her, ""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, uh, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me

Vorrei il tuo tempo per riempirlo con te al centro
Altro non vorrei che averti nel mio tempo,
Senza di te il vento il decadimento
Che sei unico mio punto di riferimento,
Vorrei il tuo tempo,
Vorresti fosse che giorno?
Io so cosa non vuoi o chi vorresti che sia,
Chi terresti con te per più di un giorno
E chi sta andando via se non sta con chi stai,
Con chi stai andando via
Andrai comunque
Andrai come se n'è andato chiunque
Per come sei potresti andare ovunque.
Vorrei che fosse un altro giorno e un'altra ora,
Altro non vorrei che rivederti ancora.

Vorrei fermare il tempo adesso io
Vorrei prima che sia domani,
Vorrei perderti e ritrovarti ancora
Vorrei che tutto fosse come te. (come te, come te)

Vorrei il tuo tempo e stare sempre in movimento
Roteando girando intorno al centro (concentro)
Concentro il tempo che resta poi osservandoti che sei unico mio punto di riferimento (vorrei)
Vorrei che tu fossi al volante di ogni singolo mezzo
Che mi causa anche il minimo spostamento
Ogni commento,
Ogni consiglio andato è un fuoco spento
E ogni istante lo passo guidando attento (mi sento)
Mi sento a metà strada e non penso che sia il momento
Nell'istante in cui rallento mi decocentro e perdo orientamento,
Da parte mia questo non sembra un andamento (com'è)
Com'è che in te non sento il cambiamento,
Vorrei il tuo tempo, vorrei il tuo tempo
Vorrei il mio nome scritto in maiuscolo ovunque sul tuo pavimento
Vorrei che fosse un altro giorno, un'altra ora
Altro non vorrei che rivederti ancora. (ancora, ancora, ancora..)

Vorrei fermare il tempo adesso io
Vorrei prima che sia domani,
Vorrei perderti e ritrovarti ancora
Vorrei che tutto fosse come te
Averti nel mio tempo,
Io vorrei che fosse già domani,
Vorrei vederti ritornare ancora,
Vorrei che tutto fosse come te.

Vorresti, vorresti fosse che giorno
Forse non cambio in nulla almeno guardati intorno
Intorno a noi terra che scotta non so ci credo,
Sarà il sole che entra in casa ma io per noi stravedo
Per quel che t'interessi il tempo avanza (e non fai)
E non fai altro che cercare una qualsiasi distanza
Vorrei il tuo tempo per dargli importanza
Vorrei che fosse il giorno più adatto per non sentir la tua mancanza
Vorresti, vorresti fosse che giorno,
Vorresti fosse un giorno in partenza e non di ritorno
Più in alto di qui c'è soltanto dell'altro,
Che d'altro non parliamo, piano,
Da chi ci allontaniamo
Penso che non ci si annoia per caso
Per casa tutto così ordinato nel caso
In cui qualcuno venisse
Solitamente parli di strane personcine mai viste, (mai viste)

non ho mai fatto grandi successi in generale,
guardando gli altri mi sembravano cosi' lontani,
chiedendomi se a casa loro volassero i divani!
L'ultima volta che mio padre e' andato a letto con mia madre
prese a calci una parete e in testa gli cadde una trave,

Ma cosa pensi di invogliarmi vengo dai portici ercolani
Voglio andare dove a chi ruba staccano orecchie gambe e mani

Ma questa velina russa che faccia da prostituta
Come dirò a mio figlio che esistono i pedofili al mondo
Oggi che in galera ci vai soltanto per stupro

Perché è una vita che sogna il negro dentro il suo imbuto!

Al posto di stupide minorate minorenni in minigonna
Fanno tanto le emancipate e poi che vergogna
Quando a letto le spogli è più maiala mia nonna
Dimmi tu cosa pensi di quel padre di famiglia
Che andava a Cuba a farsi le ragazze più giovani della figlia
Quando vent'anni fa prometteva fedeltà alla moglie
Ma non esiste marito che non sia mai andato a troie!

La ragazza amore mio Ã¨ ancora chiusa in galera
io mi chiedo e mi domando quando uscirÃ 
sono anche passati gli anni in cui ero minorenne
abbiamo fatto un pÃ² di danni ma quando uscirÃ ?
e pensare che eravamo affiatati parecchio
e siamo diventati i piÃ¹ famosi della cittÃ 
siamo anche finiti in tele c'ha visto l'Italia
amore mio ti rendi conto che pubblicitÃ 
ma chissÃ  cosa pensava la piccola Sofia
quando volava dal balcone spaccata a metÃ 
mi sarebbe piaciuto almeno questo Natale
ritornare a casa mia salutare papÃ 
se penso che perÃ² ho esagerato
e magari lo ammetto che mi sono sbilanciato
lanciato mi sono pure sputtanato
ho macchiato il maglione di sangue appena l'ho comprato
me l'hanno pure sequestrato mi sono entrati
in camera anche senza un mandato
ho pure fatto 21 anni e il giorno del
compleanno non l'ho neanche festeggiato
peccato!mi hanno rinchiuso in questa cella
sapessi che fastidio in bagno essere toccato
mi fanno uscire il giorno in cui presenterÃ²
a qualche prete un piano di volontariato
io se ho fatto quel che ho fatto
Ã¨ perchÃ¨ quando l'ho fatto
ero fatto anche troppo innamorato
solo perchÃ¨ ti immagino con gente nuda
e commetto un reato dicono questo Ã¨ malato
e poi cos'Ã¨ questa storia cariata
cazzo vai a dire in giro che non sei piÃ¹ innamorata?
come puoi trovarti un nuovo ragazzo
dopo quello che abbiamo passato ma sei ubriaca?!
e se magari fai un figlio scommetto
il povero neonato finirÃ  in un sacchetto
dopo tutte queste madri che impazziscono
e abbandonano il figlio dentro qualche cassonetto
dopo le 97 coltellate per uccidere tua madre
con i tagli nel petto
dopo tutte le versioni che ho detto
ti permetti di portare un altro uomo nel letto?
ma visto che sognavi di perdere tuo fratello
io ti uccido pure lui almeno il quadro Ã¨ perfetto
e adesso che potremo stare io e te da soli
t'innamori di un altro ma tu lo fai per dispetto?!!

Oh problemi di coppia ma dico non lo sai prima
o poi che la coppia scoppia la coppia scoppia

figlio pazzo figlio pazzo pazzo pazzo
Oh l'amore ti blocca ma dico non lo sai prima

arrivo con la faccia dello sbruffone
cammino con il passo da strascicone

ho l'energia implosiva quando gonfio
la mia pancia dalla cannabis attiva
e quando perdo la saliva e meglio che
prendi aria altrimenti non sai chi arriva
ho la mascella che mi vibra e se parlo s'inca
ca castra porca figa mi piace fare il galante
solamente con donne che hanno 1000 euro in contante
esco dal coma e mi rimetto al volante
ho fatto inversione a U in piazza Dante
se magari faccio testa coda e lei s'appoggia
alla mia spalla cosa fa ci prova?
se magari sei in competizione con tua madre
vuoi punirla cosa fai chiami Omar?
oh queste ragazze appena lo prendono
diventano subito pazze cambieranno religioni
perÃ² le mestruazioni ci sono in tutte quante le razze
se la mia ragazza fa la troia in palestra
appena torna a casa io le spacco la testa
e quando impazzirÃ² perchÃ¨ il lavoro mi stressa
allora lancerÃ² mio figlio dalla finestra
oh!quale sarebbe la nazione piÃ¹ adatta
per trovarsi una ragazza con il cuore di latta
questo trambusto ormonale non passa
e fai un figlio a 70 anni e vedrai come scappa
ma io non voglio impazzire per una sciatta
che tra lei e sua madre non si sa chi Ã¨ piÃ¹ vacca

fai la mogliettina sexy anche la mamma che allatta

A parte il rap io sono un fallito
Stacchi questa musica e son bello che finito
A volte mi sembra davvero di essere impazzito
Ma ho visto anche i fumetti su di me in qualche sito
La gente è convinta che con il rap ci guadagniamo
Se appari in un giornale è come se non fossi umano
Qualcuno che fa il botto c'è, può essere fortuna
Sembra che se non fai il botto finirai sei piedi sotto
E se per ogni uomo esistono 7 ragazze
Guarda me le son giocate incontrandole tutte pazze
Se c'ho la faccia stanca è perché l'incubo continua
Impazzirei se tutto riniziasse domattina
E anche volendolo
Io non saprei tornare come prima
Corro scrivo registro ma non sento nessuna rima
La mia voce riascoltandola neanche sembra la mia
Resterò qui altre 8 ore augurandomi un attacco di cuore

Mi hanno battezzato in chiesa
Fra attenzioni e vari affetti
Cresciuto in mezzo ai quadri con Gesù e gli angioletti
Una classica famiglia cristiana ha I suoi difetti
Ed è per questo che quando bestemmi dopo ci rifletti
E magari ti penti, ""Questa è l'ultima"" prometti
E giri il mondo disegnando Dio per terra coi gessetti
Ma il diavolo entra in casa anche se tu non te lo aspetti
L'insoddisfazione arriva anche se c'hai I figli perfetti
Io ringrazio il cielo per non essere nato un bigotto
Per non essere un ciellino o un fissato all'Enalotto
Ringrazio Dio per non avere un padre che fa il poliziotto
Mio padre non è un ladro né un politico corrotto
Mia madre per capirlo avrebbe dato via anche un rene
Anche se a volte le persone impazziscono a stare insieme
Sono dieci anni che provo a dimostrare loro qualcosa
Ma per stare con entrambi a me mi servirebbe un sosia

E se magari sputtani qualcuno allora sei anche un figo
Mi sta sul cazzo Grido, I gemelli, il cugino
Duecento nomi a caso di gente che non sa persino che io rimo
Chi sia abituati a facce vecchie
Ma le rime che io scrivo bastonano alle orecchie
E visto che c'ho un pubblico cresciuto dal niente
Me ne sbatto del modo in cui muove il culo la gente
Sta roba prende perché è intraprendente
Musica che aiuta a sfuggire dal niente
Te lo direbbe anche una muta
Ma Dio quanto possa essere falso io
Quanto possa andare in basso mi stupisco anche io
Quando parli mi stai sul cazzo si fa si sa
Non ho palle abbastanza grandi per cambiar città

non sopporto me stesso e faccio mr simpatia
basta accusi il mio rap come fosse uno stupro in compagnia
vallo un pÃ² a dire ai parenti della piccola Lucia

Il mio corpo Ã¨ a terra ma non mi sposti da qui
mi servirÃ  una barella ma non mi sposti da qui
ribalto le mie budelle ma non mi sposti da qui
finche il mio rap Ã¨ in guerra

La stanza Ã¨ questa un puzza che impesta
sta ragazza Ã¨ per terra ma il corpo nudo e senza testa
i capelli sparsi le mie impronte sulle pareti
io mi nascondo mezzo nudo mentre piango tra i vetri
ma io non c'entro anche se
ed Ã¨ una coincidenza la mia giacca in mezzo alle siepi
sarÃ  un caso la mia fronte insanguinata macchiata
ma sta ragazza che mi sta accanto non l ho neanche toccata
mangio volgaritÃ  non dico mai la veritÃ 
ma cazzo froci culo figa ciao mamma ciao papÃ 
qualcuno mi aiuti ho solamente un collasso
non posso ammazzarmi ho il balcone troppo basso
ma finche esisto brucerÃ² ogni impianto
che piuttosto di calmarmi vado in cerca allo schianto
come il figlio (..)
benvunuti al mio drive in sono pazzo questo Ã¨ quanto

Il mio corpo Ã¨ a terra ma non mi sposti da qui
mi servirÃ  una barella ma non mi sposti da qui
ribalto le mie budelle ma non mi sposti da qui
finche il mio rap Ã¨ in guerra

e mica Ã¨ un caso che racconto di Carletto Giuliani
o di altra gente scomparsa dall'oggi al domani
se ti immedesimassi in me capiresti i miei piani
non sono poi cosi diverso dai tanti italiani
che la mattina vanno in bagno con le palle dei cani
al posto degli occhi per un turno e uno stipendo da infami
in un sistema che Ã¨ meglio se ne stiamo lontani
perchÃ¨ Ã¨ la coca che distrugge un grande come Pantani
mica la gente che c'Ã¨ intorno e vuole show da marziani
tutti vogliono sapere dei miei testi insani
tutti vogliono vedere con che facci rimani
tutti vogliono allungare le mani..allungare le mani..allungare le mani",Rap in Guerra,2006

parlo col mio dottore ho un crampo nel cuore
ho lo sguardo che assomiglia a un albanese in calore
ma non posso stare qui sento il richiamo al terrore
e voglio scendere in guerra per mitragliare un orrore
avanti che ho la bomba il mio credo rimbomba
sono il primo kamikaze che si scava la tomba e vado in onda
sopra l'elmetto ho una cinepresa ho stuprato i prigionieri

perchÃ¨ hanno detto che in Italia il Presidente Ã¨ sparito
io mi osno innervosito perchÃ¨ lui per me Ã¨ un mito
quindi ho fatto karakiri e prima ho ucciso un mio amico
almeno vale il doppio le immagini e il botto
non bisogna aver paura di nessuno purtroppo
il mio Dio o il tuo Dio, qual'Ã¨ il Dio farlocco?
sembra quasi che nel mondo ci sia un Dio di troppo
non mi ha interessato chi non Ã¨ morto ammazzato
senza neanche un attentato o un funerale di stato

io fossi nato donna ascolterei Madonna
vestirei senza mutande ovunque e sempre in minigonna
cosi non mi ci vedo e neanche tu scometto
allora cosa cazzo guardi nei bagni dal tuo armadietto
il mio cazzo in questione ne vuoi un illustrazione
vorresti anche toccarlo brutto pezzo di un recchione

non mangio non ingrasso ma nemmeno perdo chili

sarÃ  per questa gente convinta che sia una messa in scena
oltretutto penosamente oscena
e adesso mi chiedono quale sia il sistema
visto che ogni insulto lo comprendi appena
ti sei abituata a questo linguaggio in tema
dopo l'ultimo disco ho ancora il collo che trema
e tu mi domandi quale sia il problema

Rit:
Tira su le mani se anche tu sei un pazzo,
Di questa musica anche tu sei un pazzo.

Non Ã¨ un poi un dramma il modo in cui io mi comporto
qui da me girava voce che fossi davvero morto
e tutti che si aspettano che io davvero sfondi
tra cantanti che arrostiscono ed esplodono in due secondi
ho l'impressione che questa notte io non dormirÃ²
mi metto il cuore in pace sono a ruota giÃ  da un pÃ²
il mio conto corrente Ã¨ profondo rosso
potessi rapinarti lo farei perÃ² non posso
indosso magliette larghe firme da battone
le tue magliette strette le disegna un culattone
mi sveglio con cervello aperto in due come una foca
piÃ¹ fato come un cavallo strafatto di coca
speravi che questa roba non facesse piÃ¹ effetto
il bello Ã¨ che rimango vero per un cerchio ristretto
fino a ieri tu di me non conoscevi mezza rima
e quanti squali ho attirato con il mio sangue in copertina?

Rit.

Qualcuno Ã¨ convinto che io dentro sia vuoto
e se Dio mi sentisse penserebbe che sia un gioco
sul fianco ho stampata la santa croce che va a fuoco
eppure parlo della chiesa capendono ben poco
non credo nel destino da quando ho visto Alfredino
ti assicuro quella storia mi ha scioccato da bambino
io scrivo per necessitÃ  c'ho scosse emozionali
sfogandomi Ã¨ la cura ai miei disturbi celebrali
Mr.Simpatia a casa cazzi amari
ti cantano i fighetti punk i dark e i metallari
io cazzo vuoi che dica faccio rap per i maiali
canto in bunker in tendoni in covi morti e nei locali
in piazza e in discoteca ma mai nei centri sociali

Fabri Fibra,"Questa è un'altra hit
Marracash
Baby se non vuoi fare, che sali a fare? 
Realizzato che questa non prende come la 3
Faccio un club sandwich e poi faccio un sandwich al club
Voglio stare al top solo per non vederci te
Questi armadi in giacca Armani fanno affari con me
La tua storia non mi è nuova, è che ero io e non te
Non parlare a me di swag, sto sull'Uomo Vogue, nuovo flow
La tua hit sembra la sigla di Dragon Ball

Quando esce il tuo disco non se ne accorge nessuno
Il mio lo attendono come i parenti di un detenuto
Se non ti entra in testa questa, forse hai lasciato chiuso
Spruzzo carisma come fosse il nome di un profumo
Tu sei vero, tu sei bravo, tu sei soprattutto furbo
Sono serio, sono chiaro e sono sopra tutto, punto
Non mi tengo, metto tutte 'ste frasi in un solo pezzo
Sono la ragione per cui i locali chiudono presto

Vorrei poterti dire che 'sta vita non è il top
Però il problema è che non, non, non mento
E quando i riflettori caleranno me ne andrò
Però il problema è che è il mio mo-mo-mento
E ho questa vita da star, vita da star
Questa vita da star, vita da star

Son passato dai punti sui chili ai punti di share
Tu che punti su dei ragazzini unti di gel
Lauto pranzo, frà, da guida Michelin
Bevo tanto, tanto l'auto poi la guida Michelle
Brickstone, l'età della roccia tipo Flintstone
Ti smontano l'auto a tempo record, tipo Pit Stop
Pisto, cambio aria per il nuovo disco
In Italia hai un'aria da sconfitto (sì, ma sai, la crisi)
Pagami in sessanta secondi, altro che sessanta giorni
Ho messo il cash già nel nome come nei Sessanta Johnny
Mia madre piange, ultimamente non mi vede bene
Allora sono uscito e le ho comprato un'altra tele
Io non ho figli però ho un tenore da mantenere
Non ho bagagli e ho idee troppo grandi per 'sto Paese
Brindo col secchio, vodka e frutto della passione
A tutto questo perché frutto della passione

Vorrei poterti dire che 'sta vita non è il top
Però il problema è che non, non, non mento
E quando i riflettori caleranno me ne andrò
Però il problema è che è il mio mo-mo-mento
E ho questa vita da star, vita da star
Questa vita da star, vita da star

Faccio un disco tripla A, sono ancora popolare
Spacchi nella tua città ma io sono nazionale
Dai a me del commerciale su un giornale 
La cui metà delle pagine sono pubblicitarie
Questi non sanno se sono zarro o sono colto
Ai giornalisti entrambe le cose gli sembra troppo
Dovrei vestirmi da mediocre, forse senza brand
Esattamente come da Superman, Clark Kent

Fabri Fibra,"Baci sopra le guance, coltelli dentro alle pance
Il successo non ci nobilita e la strada non ci fa piangere
Legati mani e piedi
Testa al domani e cuore a ieri
Dentro i salotti ricchi e barocchi
E dai pippotti dentro ai quartieri
A me non mi disseta sbocciare, non mi toglie fame il caviale
Non è una collana o un bracciale che cambia il tessuto sociale
Senza la gente non sono niente
Sono un pusher senza il cliente
Il veleno senza il serpente, io ci campo sulle leggende

Io voglio solo spiegare le ali
Osservare la vita dall’alto e tornare nel posto in cui ho avuto i natali
Restare con i comuni mortali
Non sono mai davvero contento
Ho sempre in testa quel senso
Nella suite o nel cemento
Non so qual’è il mio posto e il mio tempo
Vorrei tagliare la corda ma la strada mi incolla le Jordan
Guardare per terra, arrivare secondo
Prendersi il mondo
Mela della discordia

Sono ali e radici, oro e champagne
Oppure sangue e sacrifici
Sono un mare di soldi, un mare di merda
Sono le mie cicatrici

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio
Sogno un cuore di ghiaccio e il calore di un abbraccio
Ali e radici

Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani, non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Siamo fatti di incubi e sogni
E di santi che scalano i giorni
La famiglia, gli amici, gli amori
A sto punto sono solo lussi o bisogni
A noi chi ci tiene legati
Cuori spezzati amici d’infanzia pregiudicati
Come fare a volare senza farci dire che siamo cambiati
Cosa mi dice lo specchio
Cosa?
Mi guarda sorride mi parla all’orecchio
Poi dice fottili tutti e scopale tutte
Perché fra un po’ sarai vecchio
Sempre col diavolo sopra la spalla
Angelo scuote la testa e non parla
Perché la verità è sempre una merda
È più divertente ascoltare la palla

Ora queste ali pesano meno
Se conquisto un pezzo di cielo
Se recido queste radici
Sotto la strada in mezzo al veleno
Vivo ed io non cerco il perdono
L’ho voluto quello che sono
Non è l’uomo a fare la scelta
Ma la scelta a fare l’uomo
Io vivo un po' nell’oro e un po' nella merda
Ho un occhio chiuso ed un occhio all’erta
Una mano a pugno e una mano aperta
Una carta giù ed una carta scoperta
Ho imparato guardando due mondi
Su ai grattaceli giù ai bassi fondi
Tra gli edifici o alle radici, ora sono pronto per saldare i conti (sì)

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio
Sogno un cuore di ghiaccio e il calore di un abbraccio
Ali e radici
Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani, non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Mai messo radici
Le ho sempre fumate
Mai avuto le ali
Scarpe consumate
Sempre fatto il mio
Anche se non ci credevano in molti
Ci vorrebbe un amico ora che girano tutti sti soldi

Fammi passare dai
Dipende sempre quanto dai
Ogni ragazza porta guai
La verità non conta mai
Tocca lasciare un segno perché siamo tutti di passaggio
Questa vita ha un dito sopra il grilletto e non scherza un cazzo
Dal top al fondo in mezzo c’è un mondo che vale la pena visitare
Mi guardo in torno e se non rispondo è perché sono in preda a crisi varie

Tu cosa cerchi?
Qualunque cosa sia là non nascosta bene
Oh bella Jake era da troppo che aspettavo un pezzo insieme
I rapper che spaccano oggi sono cresciuti sopra due dischi
Dal 2004 pompano Mister Simpatia e Mi Fist
Amici che vengono altri che vanno e chi li ha mai più visti
Lo vedi alla fine abbimo sfruttato anche i momenti tristi

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio

Dove non contava tanto come vestivi

Pensano alla moda anche i ragazzini

La musica è tutta di plastica
Perchè qui vedi come si ricicla
Meglio cambiare aria
I soldi mica danno sempre la serenità
I giovani in Italia trovano lavoro 
Solamente in Serie A
La voglia di partire che viene e và
Conservo ancora tutti i biglietti aerei
Guardo fuori in cortile quanta neve fa
Che stavamo in piscina, mi sembra ieri

Ho preso così tanti schiaffi che ci penso 

Ogni giorno 
Prendo la mia dose quotidiana di merda 
Ogni giorno 
Sento la pressione che mi schiaccia per terra
Ogni giorno 
Dietro questi soldi perché farli è una guerra 
Ogni giorno (ogni giorno)
Cerco di scappare ma qualcuno mi osserva 

È solo chi non conta un cazzo che non ha nemici 
Troppe foto divento matto hai voluto la bici? 
Locali pieni, gente vuota, uomini distinti 
La notte è immersa nella coca vincitori e vinti 
Ricorda, contano le azioni è inutile che twitti 
Quando il padrone salta fuori stanno tutti zitti 
I soliti miti che imiti, mi irriti 
I soldi vanno e vengono come gli spiriti 
Esco la sera presto 
Torno a casa depresso 
20 pali nel cesso 
Frate cazzo è successo? 
Sono fuori contesto 
Fuori col testo 
Esprimi te stesso 
Il gioco è complesso 
Lo senti il vuoto è immenso

Vedo la gente morta 
Ho il sesto senso

Dimmi a cosa pensi, ogni giorno 
Parecchia gente cambia idea (ogni giorno)
Senza lavoro quanto stress, (ogni giorno)
Ho scritto una rima diversa, (ogni giorno)
Ci penso la notte e non dormo (non dormo)
Perché il talento è più forte del sonno (del sonno)
Pensieri provano a mandarmi sotto (sotto)
Chi non si fida poi rimane solo 
Quanti problemi ogni giorno 
Dove siamo non mi ricordo 
Non mi chiamare non ti voglio 
Ho perso pure il portafoglio 
Quanti problemi ogni giorno 
Tu scrivi insulti non rispondo 
Quante persone che assecondo 
Vorrebbero mandarmi a fondo

Ogni giorno 
Prendo la mia dose quotidiana di merda

Sento la pressione che mi schiaccia per terra

Quando sotto casa gli hanno sparato
Ma quanta violenza che passa in tele
Però meglio in tele che dentro casa
Frate, lavoravo in un ufficio

In Italia non funziona un cazzo

La bella gente, la pista, le luci
E le ventenni vanno a letto con i vecchi
Per pagarsi una borsa di Gucci
A Milano piove spumante
Perché lo Champagne è francese
Un matto gira in centro in mutande
E uccide i passanti con un machete
La politica ci vuole divisi
In TV sento parlare di Isis
Su nel cielo, guarda, volano missili
Fuori fighe da sfilate Intimissimi
Droga gira in questi party, unisciti
Ogni tanto vedi c'è chi collassa
Gli adulti che si fanno selfie in crisi
Non trovano parole neanche per gli hashtag

Fabri Fibra,"Perché sono così cattivo, non c’hai mai pensato? 
Non sai cos’ho passato 
Non te l’ho mai spiegato? 
Mia madre mi soffoca da quando sono nato 
Mi vorrebbe morto dopo quello che son diventato 
Per lei è difficile accettare che ora sono grande 
Prendevo botte fino a quando non usciva il sangue 
Se non pulisci camera 
Ordina quei cassetti guarda 
Non esci di casa finché non pulisci la mansarda 
Ho parlato con i professori dicono, ""sei stupido"" 
Dovresti andare via di casa, ""quando? Subito"" 
Mia madre non voleva che in casa avessimo animali, infatti 
Una mattina mi sveglio e non c’erano più i miei gatti 

Mia madre 
Mia madre 
Mi ha rovinato la vita mia madre 
E non è mai finita con mia madre 
Ora capisco mio padre 
Scusa mamma 
Lo sai mamma 
Mi manchi mamma 
Ma ormai mamma 
Questo è il karma 
Tu mai calma 
'Sta vita è un dramma 
Perdono mamma 

Voleva che restassi chiuso in casa, mia madre 
Risposta vera o falsa chi lo sa, con mia madre 
Che mi fumava in faccia a sedici anni, mia madre 
Dicendo ""dalla faccia mi ricordi tuo padre"" 
Come se fosse colpa mia 
Ho perso ogni compagnia 
Soffro di claustrofobia appena parlo di mia madre 
Non voleva che uscissi con una ragazza mia madre 
Mi parlava con gli occhi fissi di una pazza mia madre 
Non mi ha mai incoraggiato a fare niente mia madre 
Mi diceva, mi diceva ""sei impotente mia madre"" 
Ripeteva queste cattiverie per farmi male 
Poi di nuovo ""sembri tuo padre, mi fai schifo animale"" 
""Mamma lasciami andare 
Non mi parlare come un pupazzo 
Non so più stare in mezzo alla gente ho i pensieri di un pazzo"" 
Mi sento solo e ringrazio mia madre 
La notte sogno che ammazzo mia madre 

Mia madre

Mi ha rovinato la vita mia madre

Ora capisco mio padre 
Scusa mamma 
Lo sai mamma

Tu mai calma 
'Sta vita è un dramma 
Perdono mamma 

Mia madre mi manda messaggi mi dice ""ti guardo quando vai in tv"" 
Poi chiama dicendo ""ho visto che parli di casa non farlo mai più"" 
Lei teme che io dica a tutti quanti schiaffi ho preso 
Per capirlo basta guardare come son venuto sù 
Non faccio bella figura ma infondo dimmi chi la fa 
Ho avuto sempre paura ad affrontare la verità 
Ora son qui a dirla a tutti, vedi la maschera cade 
Al posto del pubblico ai concerti vedo mia madre 
Sono sincero e qui lo dico sto avendo una crisi 
In giro devo sempre fingere mille sorrisi 
Non voglio più tenermi dentro questo peso 
La mia gioventù passata come un incompreso 
Se mia madre fosse qui adesso mi direbbe ""non ti vergogni?"" 
Non aiuti mai tuo fratello 
Lui che insegue i tuoi stessi sogni 
Parlare di questo era il mio più grande problema 
Finisce il testo
Mamma, volevi che fossi me stesso?

Né doveri o pensieri 
Che figata tornare tardi con nessuno che chiede dov’eri? 
Che figata quando a casa scrivo 
Quando poi svuoto il frigo

Sei infantile sei piccolo 
Che fastidio guardarti mentre vado a picco

Che fastidio parlarti, vorrei stare zitto

E sul momento non me ne ero accorto 
E poi nemmeno credo di esser pronto 
E poi nemmeno penso d’esser sobrio 
E poi un figlio non lo voglio proprio 
E poi a te nemmeno ti conosco 
Cercavo solo un po’ di vino rosso 
Però alla fine vedi è tutto apposto 
Si vede che non era il nostro corso 
Si dice tutto fumo e niente arrosto 
Però il profumo mi è rimasto addosso

Nuoto veloce come un barracuda
In questo mare di squali paura nessuna
A pancia piena con la bocca chiusa
Tu pesce piccolo io barracuda

I soldi rendono felici (eh si, eh)
Pago cene e pranzi agli amici (eh, oh)
Vado a dormire quando voglio (buongiorno)
Non mi interessa che ore sono (che ore sono?)

Conta solo quanto si vende
Manco fosse un negozio di Gucci
Poi so bene come ci si sente
Quando spengono le luci
E dagli occhi ti escono fulmini
Perché contano solo i numeri
E noi che siamo stati gli ultimi
Ora è bello non dover lavorare il lunedì
Ero da solo senza una lira
Tu non immagini i sacrifici
Sono tornato più forte di prima
Quindi pregate per i miei nemici

Ho preso un disco solo per la copertina
Mille messaggi, sempre la stessa faccina
Ma se non usi i social nessuno si fida (ah)

Fabrizio De André,"""Poterti smembrare coi denti e le mani, 
sapere i tuoi occhi bevuti dai cani, 
di morire in croce puoi essere grato 
a un brav'uomo di nome Pilato."" 

Ben più della morte che oggi ti vuole, 
t'uccide il veleno di queste parole: 
le voci dei padri di quei neonati, 
da Erode per te trucidati. 

Nel lugubre scherno degli abiti nuovi 
misurano a gocce il dolore che provi; 
trent'anni hanno atteso col fegato in mano, 
i rantoli d'un ciarlatano. 

Si muovono curve le vedove in testa, 
per loro non è un pomeriggio di festa; 
si serran le vesti sugli occhi e sul cuore 
ma filtra dai veli il dolore: 

fedeli umiliate da un credo inumano 
che le volle schiave già prima di Abramo, 
con riconoscenza ora soffron la pena 
di chi perdonò a Maddalena, 

di chi con un gesto soltanto fraterno 
una nuova indulgenza insegnò al Padreterno, 
e guardano in alto, trafitti dal sole, 
gli spasimi d'un redentore. 

Confusi alla folla ti seguono muti, 
sgomenti al pensiero che tu li saluti: 
""A redimere il mondo"" gli serve pensare, 
il tuo sangue può certo bastare. 

La semineranno per mare e per terra 
tra boschi e città la tua buona novella, 
ma questo domani, con fede migliore, 
stasera è più forte il terrore. 

Nessuno di loro ti grida un addio 
per esser scoperto cugino di Dio: 
gli apostoli han chiuso le gole alla voce, 
fratello che sanguini in croce. 

Han volti distesi, già inclini al perdono, 
ormai che han veduto il tuo sangue di uomo 
fregiarti le membra di rivoli viola, 
incapace di nuocere ancora. 

Il potere vestito d'umana sembianza, 
ormai ti considera morto abbastanza 
e già volge lo sguardo a spiar le intenzioni 
degli umili, degli straccioni. 

Ma gli occhi dei poveri piangono altrove, 
non sono venuti a esibire un dolore 
che alla via della croce ha proibito l'ingresso 
a chi ti ama come se stesso. 

Sono pallidi al volto, scavati al torace, 
non hanno la faccia di chi si compiace 
dei gesti che ormai ti propone il dolore, 
eppure hanno un posto d'onore. 

Non hanno negli occhi scintille di pena. 
Non sono stupiti a vederti la schiena 
piegata dal legno che a stento trascini, 
eppure ti stanno vicini. 

Perdonali se non ti lasciano solo, 
se sanno morir sulla croce anche loro, 
a piangerli sotto non han che le madri, 
in fondo, son solo due ladri.",Via Della Croce,1970
Fabrizio De André,"Mai più mi chinai e nemmeno su un fiore
Più non arrossii nel rubare l'amore
Dal momento che Inverno mi convinse che Dio
Non sarebbe arrossito rubandomi il mio

Mi arrestarono un giorno per le donne ed il vino
Non avevano leggi per punire un blasfemo
Non mi uccise la morte, ma due guardie bigotte
Mi cercarono l'anima a forza di botte

Perché dissi che Dio imbrogliò il primo uomo
Lo costrinse a viaggiare una vita da scemo
Nel giardino incantato lo costrinse a sognare
A ignorare che al mondo c'e' il bene e c'è il male

Quando vide che l'uomo allungava le dita
A rubargli il mistero di una mela proibita
Per paura che ormai non avesse padroni
Lo fermò con la morte, inventò le stagioni

Mi cercarono l'anima a forza di botte

E se furon due guardie a fermarmi la vita
È proprio qui sulla terra la mela proibita
E non Dio, ma qualcuno che per noi l'ha inventato
Ci costringe a sognare in un giardino incantato
Ci costringe a sognare in un giardino incantato
Ci costringe a sognare in un giardino incantato",Un  Blasfemo,1971
Fabrizio De André,"Cosa vuol dire avere un metro e mezzo di statura
Ve lo rivelan gli occhi e le battute della gente
O la curiosità di una ragazza irriverente
Che li avvicina solo per un suo dubbio impertinente
Vuole scoprir se è vero quanto si dice intorno ai nani
Che siano I più forniti della virtù meno apparente
Fra tutte le virtù la più indecente

Passano gli anni I mesi, e se li conti anche I minuti
È triste trovarsi adulti senza essere cresciuti
La maldicenza insiste, batte la lingua sul tamburo
Fino a dire che un nano è una carogna di sicuro
Perché ha il cuore troppo, troppo vicino al buco del culo

Fu nelle notti insonni vegliate al lume del rancore
Che preparai gli esami, diventai procuratore
Per imboccare la strada che dalle panche di una cattedrale
Porta alla sacrestia quindi alla cattedra di un tribunale
Giudice finalmente, arbitro in terra del bene e del male

E allora la mia statura non dispensò più buonumore
A chi alla sbarra in piedi mi diceva ""Vostro Onore""
E di affidarli al boia fu un piacere del tutto mio
Prima di genuflettermi nell'ora dell'addio
Non conoscendo affatto la statura di Dio",Un  Giudice,1971
Fabrizio De André,"""Cominciai a sognare anch'io insieme a loro 
poi l'anima d'improvviso prese il volto."" 

Da ragazzo spiare i ragazzi giocare 
al ritmo balordo del tuo cuore malato 
e ti viene la voglia di uscire e provare 
che cosa ti manca per correre al prato, 
e ti tieni la voglia, e rimani a pensare 
come diavolo fanno a riprendere fiato. 

Da uomo avvertire il tempo sprecato 
a farti narrare la vita dagli occhi 
e mai poter bere alla coppa d'un fiato 
ma a piccoli sorsi interrotti, 
e mai poter bere alla coppa d'un fiato 
ma a piccoli sorsi interrotti. 

Eppure un sorriso io l'ho regalato 
e ancora ritorna in ogni sua estate 
quando io la guidai o fui forse guidato 
a contarle i capelli con le mani sudate. 

Non credo che chiesi promesse al suo sguardo, 
non mi sembra che scelsi il silenzio o la voce, 
quando il cuore stordÃ¬ e ora no, non ricordo 
se fu troppo sgomento o troppo felice, 
e il cuore impazzÃ¬ e ora no, non ricordo, 
da quale orizzonte sfumasse la luce. 

E fra lo spettacolo dolce dell'erba 
fra lunghe carezze finite sul volto, 
quelle sue cosce color madreperla 
rimasero forse un fiore non colto. 

Ma che la baciai questo sÃ¬ lo ricordo 
col cuore ormai sulle labbra, 
ma che la baciai, per Dio, sÃ¬ lo ricordo, 
e il mio cuore le restÃ² sulle labbra.

Il mercante di luce, il vostro oculista
Ora vuole soltanto clienti speciali 
Che non sanno che farne di occhi normali

Non più ottico ma spacciatore di lenti 
Per improvvisare occhi contenti
Perché le pupille abituate a copiare 
Inventino i mondi sui quali guardare
Seguite con me questi occhi sognare
Fuggire dall'orbita e non voler ritornare

Vedo che salgo a rubare il sole 
Per non aver più notti
Perché non cada in reti di tramonto
L'ho chiuso nei miei occhi
E chi avrà freddo 
Lungo il mio sguardo si dovrà scaldare

Vedo i fiumi dentro le mie vene
Cercano, cercano, cercano, cercano il loro mare
Rompono gli argini, gli argini, gli argini
Trovano cieli, cieli, cieli, cieli da fotografare
Sangue che scorre senza fantasia 
Porta tumori di malinconia

Forse volata, forse più non vola

Io con la mia bomba porto la novità
La bomba che debutta in società
Al ballo mascherato della celebrità

Spia chi fa meglio di lui
Lì dietro si racconta un amore normale 
Ma lui saprà poi renderlo tanto geniale 

E il viaggio all'inferno ora fallo da solo 
Con l'ultima invidia lasciata là sotto un lenzuolo
Sorpresa sulla porta d'una felicità 
La bomba ha risparmiato la normalità

E inciampa nella sua autorità
Affida a una vestaglia il suo ultimo ruolo

Dovrebbe accettare la bomba con serenità
Il martirio è il suo mestiere, la sua vanità
Ma ora accetta di morire soltanto a metà 
La sua parte ancora viva le fa tanta pietà
Al ballo mascherato della celebrità

Accesa soltanto a metà

ammucchiati in discesa

Metteva l'amore, metteva l'amore
La chiamavano bocca di rosa
Metteva l'amore sopra ogni cosa

Appena scese alla stazione
Nel paesino di Sant'Ilario
Tutti si accorsero con uno sguardo
Che non si trattava di un missionario

C'è chi l'amore lo fa per noia
Chi se lo sceglie per professione
Bocca di rosa né l'uno né l'altro
Lei lo faceva per passione

Ma la passione spesso conduce
A soddisfare le proprie voglie
Senza indagare se il concupito
Ha il cuore libero oppure ha moglie

E fu così che da un giorno all'altro
Bocca di rosa si tirò addosso
L'ira funesta delle cagnette
A cui aveva sottratto l'osso

Ma le comari d'un paesino
Non brillano certo in iniziativa
Le contromisure fino a quel punto
Si limitavano all'invettiva

Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
Sentendosi come Gesù nel tempio
Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
Se non può più dare cattivo esempio

Così una vecchia mai stata moglie
Senza mai figli, senza più voglie
Si prese la briga e di certo il gusto
Di dare a tutte il consiglio giusto

E rivolgendosi alle cornute
Le apostrofò con parole argute
""Il furto d'amore sarà punito""
Disse ""dall'ordine costituito""

E quelle andarono dal commissario
E dissero senza parafrasare
""Quella schifosa ha già troppi clienti
Più di un consorzio alimentare""

Ed arrivarono quattro gendarmi
Con i pennacchi, con i pennacchi
Ed arrivarono quattro gendarmi
Con i pennacchi e con le armi

Al proprio dovere vengono meno
Ma non quando sono in alta uniforme

Dal commissario al sacrestano
Alla stazione c'erano tutti
Con gli occhi rossi e il cappello in mano

A salutare chi per un poco
Senza pretese, senza pretese
A salutare chi per un poco
Portò l'amore nel paese

C'era un cartello giallo
Con una scritta nera
Diceva ""addio bocca di rosa
Con te se ne parte la primavera""

Ma una notizia un po' originale
Non ha bisogno di alcun giornale
Come una freccia dall'arco scocca
Vola veloce di bocca in bocca

E alla stazione successiva
Molta più gente di quando partiva
Chi mandò un bacio, chi gettò un fiore
Chi si prenota per due ore

Persino il parroco che non disprezza
Fra un miserere e un'estrema unzione
Il bene effimero della bellezza
La vuole accanto in processione

Fabrizio De André,"Sono la pecora sono la vacca
Che agli animali si vuol giocare
Sono la femmina camicia aperta
Piccole tette da succhiare

Sotto le ciglia di questi alberi
Nel chiaroscuro dove son nato
Che l'orizzonte prima del cielo
Ero lo sguardo di mia madre

""Che Fernandinho è come una figlia
Mi porta a letto caffè e tapioca
E a ricordargli che è nato maschio
Sarà l'istinto sarà la vita""

E io davanti allo specchio grande
Mi paro gli occhi con le dita a immaginarmi
Tra le gambe una minuscola fica

Nel dormiveglia della corriera
Lascio l'infanzia contadina
Corro all'incanto dei desideri
Vado a correggere la fortuna

Nella cucina della pensione
Mescolo i sogni con gli ormoni
Ad albeggiare sarà magia
Saranno seni miracolosi

Perché Fernanda è proprio una figlia
Come una figlia vuol far l'amore
Ma Fernandinho resiste e vomita
E si contorce dal dolore

E allora il bisturi per seni e fianchi
In una vertigine di anestesia
Finché il mio corpo mi rassomigli
Sul lungomare di Bahia

Sorriso tenero di verdefoglia
Dai suoi capelli sfilo le dita
Quando le macchine puntano i fari
Sul palcoscenico della mia vita

Dove tra ingorghi di desideri
Alle mie natiche un maschio s'appende
Nella mia carne tra le mie labbra
Un uomo scivola l'altro si arrende

Che Fernandinho mi è morto in grembo
Fernanda è una bambola di seta
Sono le braci di un'unica stella
Che squilla di luce di nome Princesa

A un avvocato di Milano
Ora Princesa regala il cuore
E un passeggiare recidivo
Nella penombra di un balcone

Fabrizio De André,"Alta sui naufragi 
dai belvedere delle torri 
china e distante sugli elementi del disastro 
dalle cose che accadono al disopra delle parole 
celebrative del nulla 
lungo un facile vento 
di sazietà di impunità 

Sullo scandalo metallico 
di armi in uso e in disuso 
a guidare la colonna 
di dolore e di fumo 
che lascia le infinite battaglie al calar della sera 
la maggioranza sta la maggioranza sta 
recitando un rosario 
di ambizioni meschine 
di millenarie paure 
di inesauribili astuzie 

Coltivando tranquilla 
l'orribile varietà 
delle proprie superbie 
la maggioranza sta 
come una malattia 
come una sfortuna 
come un'anestesia 
come un'abitudine 
per chi viaggia in direzione ostinata e contraria 

col suo marchio speciale di speciale disperazione 
e tra il vomito dei respinti muove gli ultimi passi 
per consegnare alla morte una goccia di splendore 
di umanità di verità 

per chi ad Aqaba curò la lebbra con uno scettro posticcio 
e seminò il suo passaggio di gelosie devastatrici e di figli 
con improbabili nomi di cantanti di tango 
in un vasto programma di eternità 

ricorda Signore questi servi disobbedienti 
alle leggi del branco 
non dimenticare il loro volto 
che dopo tanto sbandare 
è appena giusto che la fortuna li aiuti

come un'anomalia 
come una distrazione 
come un dovere",Smisurata Preghiera,1996

Che odio il mio lavoro
Non sa con quanto amore
Mi dedico al tritolo
È quasi indipendente

Di ordigni costruiti
Su scala industriale

La decisione è mia

O l'amnistia

Per strada tante facce

Si ammala di terrore

Delegato ad altre mani
Sganciato e restituitoci
Dai tuoi aeroplani
Io vengo a restituirti
Un po' del tuo terrore
Del tuo disordine
Del tuo rumore

Un trentenne disperato
Se non del tutto giusto
Quasi niente sbagliato
Cercando il luogo idoneo
Adatto al suo tritolo
Insomma il posto degno
D'un bombarolo

C'è chi lo vide ridere
Davanti al Parlamento
Aspettando l'esplosione
Che provasse il suo talento
C'è chi lo vide piangere
Un torrente di vocali
Vedendo esplodere
Un chiosco di giornali

Ma ciò che lo ferì
Profondamente nell'orgoglio
Fu l'immagine di lei
Che si sporgeva da ogni foglio
Lontana dal ridicolo
In cui lo lasciò solo

Fabrizio De André,"Alla parata militare
Sputò negli occhi a un innocente
E quando lui chiese ""Perché ""

E adesso è ora che io vada""

Senza le armi lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

Sui viali dietro la stazione
Rubò l'incasso a una regina
E quando lei gli disse ""Come""
Lui le risposte ""Forse è meglio è come prima
Forse è ora che io vada ""
E la regina lo seguì
Col suo dolore lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

E in una notte senza luna
Truccò le stelle ad un pilota
Quando l'aeroplano cadde
Lui disse ""È colpa di chi muore
Comunque è meglio che io vada""
Ed il pilota lo seguì
Senza le stelle lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

A un diciottenne alcolizzato
Versò da bere ancora un poco
E mentre quello lo guardava
Lui disse ""Amico ci scommetto stai per dirmi
Adesso è ora che io vada""
L'alcolizzato lo capì
Non disse niente e lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

Ad un processo per amore
Baciò le bocche dei giurati
E ai loro sguardi imbarazzati
Rispose ""Adesso è più normale
Adesso è meglio, adesso è giusto, giusto, è giusto
Che io vada""

E da marzo a febbraio mio nonno vegliava 
Sulla corrente di cavalli e di buoi 
Sui fatti miei sui fatti tuoi 

E al Dio degli inglesi non credere mai 

E quando avevo duecento lune e forse qualcuna è di troppo 
Rubai il primo cavallo e mi fecero uomo 
Cambiai il mio nome in ""Coda di lupo"" 
Cambiai il mio pony con un cavallo muto 

E al loro Dio perdente non credere mai 

E fu nella notte della lunga stella con la coda 
Che trovammo mio nonno crocifisso sulla chiesa 
Crocifisso con forchette che si usano a cena 
Era sporco e pulito di sangue e di crema 

E al loro Dio goloso non credere mai 

E forse avevo diciott'anni e non puzzavo più di serpente 
Possedevo una spranga un cappello e una fionda 
E una notte di gala con un sasso a punta 
Uccisi uno smoking e glielo rubai 

E al Dio della scala non credere mai 

Poi tornammo in Brianza per l'apertura della caccia al bisonte 
Ci fecero l'esame dell'alito e delle urine 
Ci spiegò il meccanismo un poeta andaluso 
""Per la caccia al bisonte"" disse ""Il numero è chiuso""

E a un Dio a lieto fine non credere mai 

Ed ero già vecchio quando vicino a Roma a Little Big Horn 
Capelli corti generale ci parlò all'università 
Dei fratelli tutte blu che seppellirono le asce 
Ma non fumammo con lui non era venuto in pace

Che ho scaricato la mia rabbia in un teatro di posa 
Che ho imparato a pescare con le bombe a mano 
Che mi hanno scolpito in lacrime sull'arco di Traiano

Senza le barricate 
Senza feriti, senza granate
Se avete preso per buone 
Le ""verità"" della televisione 
Anche se allora vi siete assolti 
Siete lo stesso coinvolti

E se credente ora 
Che tutto sia come prima 
Perché avete votato ancora 
La sicurezza, la disciplina
Convinti di allontanare 
La paura di cambiare 
Verremo ancora alle vostre porte 
E grideremo ancora più forte 
Per quanto voi vi crediate assolti 
Siete per sempre coinvolti
Per quanto voi vi crediate assolti 
Siete per sempre coinvolti",Canzone del Maggio,1999
Fabrizio De André,"Con tua moglie che lavava i piatti in cucina e non capiva 
con tua figlia che provava il suo vestito nuovo e sorrideva 
con la radio che ronzava 
per il mondo cose strane 
e il respiro del tuo cane che dormiva. 

Coi tuoi santi sempre pronti a benedire i tuoi sforzi per il pane 
con il tuo bambino biondo a cui hai dato una pistola per Natale 
che sembra vera, 
con il letto in cui tua moglie 
non ti ha mai saputo dare 
e gli occhiali che tra un po' dovrai cambiare.

con la tua tranquillità, lucidità, soddisfazione permanente 
la tua coda di ricambio 
le tue nuvole in affitto 
le tue rondini di guardia sopra il tetto. 

Con il tuo francescanesimo a puntate e la tua dolce consistenza 
col tuo ossigeno purgato e le tue onde regolate in una stanza 
col permesso di trasmettere 
e il divieto di parlare 
e ogni giorno un altro giorno da contare. 

Com'è che non riesci più a volare 
com'è che non riesci più a volare 
com'è che non riesci più a volare 
com'è che non riesci più a volare 

Con i tuoi entusiasmi lenti precisati da ricordi stagionali 
e una bella addormentata che si sveglia a tutto quel che le regali 
con il tuo collezionismo 
di parole complicate 
la tua ultima canzone per l'estate. 

Con le tue mani di carta per avvolgere altre mani normali 
Con l'idiota in giardino ad isolare le tue rose migliori 
col tuo freddo di montagna 
e il divieto di sudare 
e più niente per poterti vergognare.

E voi a divertirvi andate un po' più in là
andate a divertirvi dove la guerra non ci sarà.

La guerra è dappertutto, Marcondiro'ndera

Ci penseranno gli uomini, le bestie i fiori
i boschi e le stagioni con i mille colori.

Di gente, bestie e fiori no, non ce n'è più

Grazie a te ho una barca da scrivere ho un treno da perdere 
E un invito all'Hotel Supramonte dove ho visto la neve 
Sul tuo corpo così dolce di fame così dolce di sete 
Passerà anche questa stazione senza far male 
Passerà questa pioggia sottile come passa il dolore 
Ma dove dov'è il tuo amore, ma dove è finito il tuo amore. 

E ora siedo sul letto del bosco che ormai ha il tuo nome 
Ora il tempo è un signore distratto è un bambino che dorme 
Ma se ti svegli e hai ancora paura ridammi la mano

Fabrizio De André,"Evaporato in una nuvola rossa
in una delle molte feritoie della notte
con un bisogno d'attenzione e d'amore
troppo, ""Se mi vuoi bene piangi ""
per essere corrisposti,
valeva la pena divertirvi le serate estive
con un semplicissimo ""Mi ricordo"":
per osservarvi affittare un chilo d'erba
ai contadini in pensione e alle loro donne
e regalare a piene mani oceani
ed altre ed altre onde ai marinai in servizio,
fino a scoprire ad uno ad uno i vostri nascondigli
senza rimpiangere la mia credulità:
perché già dalla prima trincea
ero più curioso di voi,
ero molto più curioso di voi.

E poi sospeso dai vostri ""Come sta""
meravigliato da luoghi meno comuni e più feroci,
tipo ""Come ti senti amico, amico fragile,
se vuoi potrò occuparmi un'ora al mese di te""
""Lo sa che io ho perduto due figli""
""Signora lei è una donna piuttosto distratta.""
E ancora ucciso dalla vostra cortesia
nell'ora in cui un mio sogno
ballerina di seconda fila,
agitava per chissà quale avvenire
il suo presente di seni enormi
e il suo cesareo fresco,
pensavo è bello che dove finiscono le mie dita
debba in qualche modo incominciare una chitarra.

E poi seduto in mezzo ai vostri arrivederci,
mi sentivo meno stanco di voi
ero molto meno stanco di voi.

Potevo stuzzicare i pantaloni della sconosciuta
fino a vederle spalancarsi la bocca.
Potevo chiedere ad uno qualunque dei miei figli
di parlare ancora male e ad alta voce di me.
Potevo barattare la mia chitarra e il suo elmo
con una scatola di legno che dicesse perderemo.
Potevo chiedervi come si chiama il vostro cane
Il mio è un po' di tempo che si chiama Libero.
Potevo assumere un cannibale al giorno
per farmi insegnare la mia distanza dalle stelle.
Potevo attraversare litri e litri di corallo
per raggiungere un posto che si chiamasse arrivederci.

di essere più ubriaco di voi
di essere molto più ubriaco di voi.",Amico Fragile,1999

Lungo il morire del giorno 

Ai tuoi occhi, il deserto
Una distesa di segatura
Minuscoli frammenti 
Della fatica della natura

Hanno profili da assassini
Rinchiusi nei silenzi

Un affetto quasi implortato 

E lo stupore nei tuoi occhi 
Salì dalle tue mani 
Che vuote intorno alle sue spall
Si colmarono ai fianchi 
Della forma precisa

Di quel segreto che si svela 
Quando lievita il ventre

""Non avrai altro Dio all'infuori di me, 
spesso mi ha fatto pensare: 
genti diverse venute dall'est 
dicevan che in fondo era uguale. 

Credevano a un altro diverso da te 
e non mi hanno fatto del male. 
Credevano a un altro diverso da te 
e non mi hanno fatto del male. 

Non nominare il nome di Dio, 
non nominarlo invano. 
Con un coltello piantato nel fianco 
gridai la mia pena e il suo nome: 

ma forse era stanco, forse troppo occupato, 
e non ascoltò il mio dolore. 
Ma forse era stanco, forse troppo lontano, 
davvero lo nominai invano. 

Onora il padre, onora la madre 
e onora anche il loro bastone, 
bacia la mano che ruppe il tuo naso 
perché le chiedevi un boccone: 

quando a mio padre si fermò il cuore 
non ho provato dolore. 
Quanto a mio padre si fermò il cuore 
non ho provato dolore. 

Ricorda di santificare le feste. 
Facile per noi ladroni 
entrare nei templi che rigurgitan salmi 
di schiavi e dei loro padroni 

senza finire legati agli altari 
sgozzati come animali. 
Senza finire legati agli altari 
sgozzati come animali. 

Il quinto dice non devi rubare 
e forse io l'ho rispettato 
vuotando, in silenzio, le tasche già gonfie 
di quelli che avevan rubato: 

ma io, senza legge, rubai in nome mio, 
quegli altri nel nome di Dio. 
Ma io, senza legge, rubai in nome mio, 
quegli altri nel nome di Dio. 

Non commettere atti che non siano puri 
cioè non disperdere il seme. 
Feconda una donna ogni volta che l'ami 
così sarai uomo di fede: 

Poi la voglia svanisce e il figlio rimane 
e tanti ne uccide la fame. 
Io, forse, ho confuso il piacere e l'amore: 
ma non ho creato dolore. 

Il settimo dice non ammazzare 
se del cielo vuoi essere degno. 
Guardatela oggi, questa legge di Dio, 
tre volte inchiodata nel legno: 

guardate la fine di quel nazzareno 
e un ladro non muore di meno. 
Guardate la fine di quel nazzareno 
e un ladro non muore di meno. 

Non dire falsa testimonianza 
e aiutali a uccidere un uomo. 
Lo sanno a memoria il diritto divino, 
e scordano sempre il perdono: 

ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore 
e no, non ne provo dolore. 
Ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore 
e no, non ne provo dolore. 

Non desiderare la roba degli altri 
non desiderarne la sposa. 
Ditelo a quelli, chiedetelo ai pochi 
che hanno una donna e qualcosa: 

nei letti degli altri già caldi d'amore 
non ho provato dolore. 
L'invidia di ieri non è già finita: 
stasera vi invidio la vita. 

Ma adesso che viene la sera ed il buio 
mi toglie il dolore dagli occhi 
e scivola il sole al di là delle dune 
a violentare altre notti:

A volte I pesci cantano sul fondo del Sand Creek 
Sognai talmente forte che mi uscì il sangue dal naso 
Il lampo in un orecchio nell'altro il paradiso 
Le lacrime più piccole 
Le lacrime più grosse 
Quando l'albero della neve 
Fiorì di stelle rosse 

Ora I bambini dormono nel letto del Sand Creek 
Quando il sole alzò la testa tra le spalle della notte 
See'erano solo cani e fumo e tende capovolte 
Tirai una freccia in cielo 
Per farlo respirare 
Tirai una freccia al vento 
Per farlo sanguinare

Fabrizio De André,"Sulla piazza d'una città 
La gente guardava con ammirazione 
Un gorilla portato là 
Dagli zingari di un baraccone 

Con poco senso del pudore 
Le comari di quel rione 
Contemplavano l'animale 
Non dico come, non dico dove 

Attenti al gorilla

D'improvviso la grossa gabbia 
Dove viveva l'animale 
S'aprì di schianto non so perché 
Forse l'avevano chiusa male 

La bestia uscendo fuori di là 
Disse ""quest'oggi me la levo"" 
Parlava della verginità 
Di cui ancora viveva schiavo 

Attenti al gorilla

Il padrone si mise a urlare 
""Il mio gorilla, fate attenzione 
Non ha veduto mai una scimmia 
Potrebbe fare confusione"" 

Tutti i presenti a questo punto 
Fuggirono in ogni direzione 
Anche le donne dimostrando 
La differenza fra idea e azione 

Attenti al gorilla

Tutta la gente corre di fretta 
Di qui e di là con grande foga 
Si attardano solo una vecchietta 
E un giovane giudice con la toga 

Visto che gli altri avevan squagliato 
Il quadrumane accelerò 
E sulla vecchia e sul magistrato 
Con quattro salti si portò 

Attenti al gorilla 

""Bah"", sospirò pensando la vecchia 
""Ch'io fossi ancora desiderata 
Sarebbe cosa alquanto strana 
E più che altro non sperata"" 

""Che mi si prenda per una scimmia"" 
Pensava il giudice col fiato corto 
""Non è possibile, questo è sicuro"" 
Il seguito prova che aveva torto 

Attenti al gorilla 

Se qualcuno di voi dovesse 
Costretto con le spalle al muro, 
Violare un giudice od una vecchia 
Della sua scelta sarei sicuro 

Ma si dà il caso che il gorilla 
Considerato un grandioso fusto 
Da chi l'ha provato però non brilla 
Né per lo spirito né per il gusto 

Attenti al gorilla 

Infatti lui, sdegnata la vecchia 
Si dirige sul magistrato 
Lo acchiappa forte per un'orecchia 
E lo trascina in mezzo ad un prato 

Quello che avvenne fra l'erba alta 
Non posso dirlo per intero 
Ma lo spettacolo fu avvincente 
E lo ""suspence"" ci fu davvero 

Attenti al gorilla

Dirò soltanto che sul più bello 
Dello spiacevole e cupo dramma 
Piangeva il giudice come un vitello 
Negli intervalli gridava mamma 

Gridava mamma come quel tale 
Cui il giorno prima come ad un pollo 
Con una sentenza un po' originale 
Aveva fatto tagliare il collo

Avevi l'età che non porta dolori 
E il vento era un mago, la rugiada una dea 
Nel bosco incantato di ogni tua idea 
Nel bosco incantato di ogni tua idea

E venne l'inverno che uccide il colore 
E un babbo Natale che parlava d'amore 
E d'oro e d'argento splendevano i doni 
Ma gli occhi eran freddi e non erano buoni 
Ma gli occhi eran freddi e non erano buoni

Coprì le tue spalle d'argento e di lana 
Di pelle e smeraldi intrecciò una collana

Dai piedi ai capelli ti volle baciare

Ogni volta che parlano è una truffa

Ma mio padre è un ragazzo tranquillo 
La mattina legge molti giornali 
È convinto di avere delle idee 
E suo figlio è una nave pirata 
E suo figlio è una nave pirata

E anche adesso è rimasta una scritta nera 
Sopra il muro davanti casa mia 
Dice che il movimento vincerà 
Il gran capo ha la faccia serena 
La cravatta intonata alla camicia

Ma il bambino nel cortile si è fermato 
Si è stancato di seguire gli aquiloni 
Si è seduto tra I ricordi vicini I rumori lontani 
Guarda il muro e si guarda le mani 
Guarda il muro e si guarda le mani 
Guarda il muro e si guarda le mani",Le Storie Di Ieri,2006
Fabrizio De André,"All'ombra dell'ultimo sole 
S'era assopito un pescatore 
E aveva un solco lungo il viso
Come una specie di sorriso

Venne alla spiaggia un assassino
Due occhi grandi da bambino
Due occhi enormi di paura
Eran gli specchi di un'avventura

E chiese al vecchio ""dammi il pane
Ho poco tempo e troppa fame""
E chiese al vecchio ""dammi il vino
Ho sete e sono un assassino""

Gli occhi dischiuse il vecchio al giorno
Non si guardò neppure intorno
Ma versò il vino e spezzò il pane 
Per chi diceva ""ho sete, ho fame""

E fu il calore d'un momento
Poi via di nouvo verso il vento
Davanti agli occhi ancora il sole
Dietro alle spalle un pescatore

Dietro le spalle un pescatore
E la memoria è già dolore
È già il rimpianto d'un aprile
Giocato all'ombra di un cortile

Vennero in sella due gendarmi
Vennero in sella con le armi
Chiesero al vecchio se lì vicino 
Fosse passato un assassino

Ma all'ombra dell'ultimo sole 
S'era assopito il pescatore 
E aveva un solco lungo il viso
Come una specie di sorriso
E aveva un solco lungo il viso
Come una specie di sorriso",Il  Pescatore,2009

Fabulous,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

New hit Fabulous straight from Desert Storm
Whaaaaaat!
I don't understand how niggas insist to knows bout
How we spend car money to glist our rolls out
Play bars and buy the cris and moes out
Flash benjies just to twist the hoes out
Fabolous the one from the menatti mix
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks
Slim nigga in a big body six
Wit enough dough and pull to Gotti fixed
If I wasn't rappin I'd have a ???
Down south in a town you never heard before
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for
??? cats I keep burnin for furthermore
I'm the nigga every freak press be in a sleek S
That's gon need week rest after greekfest
Jump in private jets just to sneak west
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh

Niggas want it

Now sports the kind of nigga you could spot everyday
Sip lots of cherry 'Ze in a hot chevy 'Le
I know's a few niggas that plot to bury J
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier
What you gon do when we send shots from every way
We got perion while y'all got perrier
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass
Wit dime bitches that'll make a nigga nut fast
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter
Cop a crown and put stones on a border
Smoke the trees now that's grown underwater
Still keep 9's that'll put ya bones out of order
Got the condo cats will leave ya dead for
Chicks givin sarges and crucial head for
That make local cops go to feds for
Anything you want nigga now I got the bread for

Rockin white diamonds wit a gray necklace
Fuck and bounce don't even stay for breakfast
We doin shit that'll make maid neck twist
Wit a fancy chick we pay to pet kiss
Fuck studs I'm bout to throw bagettes in my ear
And be getting head from brunettes in a lear
If you ain't talkin money I don't wanna chit chat
Throwin partys in Jamaica when I hit plat
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore
Sport come through nigga like checks on the first
Doin the bump drivin a lex in reverse
Now we don't pop it unless it's a hundred a wop
And I'ma keep hittin y'all like an abusive pops

That burns my heart but leaves my brain in control
Screams of pain and screams of fear
That lives inside my head

So now in different shapes I come to you
Smile as I fill your head with words untrue
Addictive ways of pleasure I bring to thee
You are weak, thereby easy to victimize

Crack my whip
To project demons in your mind
Taking you down
To the forever black

Now it's my time to rise
Break you down and grind your soul
Fear and disgust cracks your face
I have reached my goal
So now that I have entered your soul
I shall proceed to crush
Not because I want to or need to
Rather just because I can

Crack my whip...

The one with the mind on a higher level
Precious life, honed to perfection
Devious in heart, spawn of the dark
Born of demon seed
The son of the one almighty
I will be there to control
Always doing what I please

Crack my whip...

Devious in heart
Spawn of the dark

Ran a sweaty farm in old Alabam'
I was just eighteen, crude and mean
And all I needed was to get my own way
Get out of my way

Any hour of the working day
She'd send me in the corn field mid-afternoon
Said son it's all part of your job

Miss Judy had a cross-eyed poodle
That I would kick if I was given the chance
Never wasn't amused by the kindness I used
I was whipped in the barn until dawn

Last summer we was restless
Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm
But it was all in the head

At the Sunday morning market
You were sorting through the odds and ends
You was looking for a bargain

'Cause you knew you'd find me waiting there
At the top of the stairs

I went there and back
Just to see how far it was
And you, you tried to tell me
But I had to learn for myself

There's more trouble at the depot
With the general workers union
And you said, ""They'll never change a thing
Well, they won't fight and they're not working""

Oh, you was my hero
How you are my good friend

But I guess I was wrong
I am to blame
But we were so young

Just another day gone

Leaning on the kitchen door

But remember one thing don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread""
So I got out

Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peacful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused
I moved on

Down in Rome I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keeps a young man alive
My body stunk but I kept my funk
At a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate indeed I was
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear I better get out of here
'for the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no no

I moved right out east yeah!
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shangai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people I was glad I found her
Oh yeah I was glad I found her

I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no Dickens, Shelley or Keats
'cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad just laugh it off
You didn't have to come here anyway

Once I was a stone many years ago
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan
Dan the blacksmith.

Once I was a sword, many years ago.
And my blade was broad, many years ago.
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,
Oh my.

Once I was a daisy, many years ago.
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.

Once I was a grub, many years ago.
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.

Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,
Said ""pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke"".

Once I was a mule, a many years ago.
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.

I was born a human baby, many years ago.
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be wild.
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.

I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.
I've known good times and disaster.
But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,
The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster.
I don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.

On a hilltop so high and show my face to the sky?

Faces,"I don't need no one's opinion
On the matter concerning my dress
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma
There were many things I did not possess
I never complained because my father said
""Son, you'll get your chance before you're my age""
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit
Written all over his face

He said, ""others may come and the others may go
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down
Three button hand me down

Now I had my fair share of these women
But they came between me and my suit
There was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston
Not forgetting the one in Detroit
They said, ""we like you, boy, and we think you're sweet
But can't you lose your suit?""
I said, ""no, no, no, no, you can't do that to me""
I remember what my father said

He said, ""others may come and the others may go
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down, ha, ha
Three button hand me down

I've never been a tidy dresser
And the fold in my trousers, it ain't straight
Still, I know a good cloth when I see one
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit

Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor
And get myself a smooth outfit
Then I remember what my father said to me
I'll make you from the open road, you all know this

He said, ""others may come and the others may go
But that suit'll be around wherever you go"", c'mon

Y un olor a carbón invadía las calles

Que sigilosamente andaban
Cantaban los pájaros su despedida
Otoño había llegado y con él
La melancolía del verano

La gente bajaba a los túneles
Envueltos por viento
Que subía corriendo escaleras
Perseguido por metro

Que cada tres minutos vaciaba los andenes
Y así la familia metro al completo
Transportaba a la gente de hogar al trabajo
Y del trabajo al calor del hogar, continuamente

Recuerdo, andaba tras pasado
Y presente su hermana melancolía caminaba
Dulce y amarga, pasado tras presente eternamente

Y futuro al frente misterioso y enigmático
Siempre con permiso de tiempo
Sinónimo de cambios y soplaban vientos

Por fin llegó la primavera y los niños amapola
La música triste se llenó de color
Y la ciudad entera salió a las calles a saludar a sol

Los días se alargaron y con ellos perdió
El sentido esta canción, gris y desencantada
Hasta el próximo invierno hermanos y hermanas

",Letargo,2007
Facto Delafé y las Flores Azules,"Dame tu luz y yo conozco el camino
Estamos de huída, es la carretera
Dejamos atrás un barrio atascado
Un lago estancado, diecinueve años

Pesa el recuerdo
Pasan las luces al revés por el retrovisor
Mi brazo, mi mano en tu regazo
Te miro de reojo, sí, sigues a mi lado

El aire por tu pelo, estrellas en el cielo
La luna tras las nubes vuelve a aparecer
Importa el movimiento, tú vives lo que siento
El instante por delante parece ya presente

El mundo se ha parado, Dios cogió un pincel
Decide que el momento será inmortalizado
Y nos pinta a mano el universo
Nos pinta, nos pinta a mano

No importa lo que digan
Hay quien nacen estrellados
Otros nacen con estrella
Muchos dejaran sus huellas
Bien pegadas al asfalto, hoy salto alto
Mi rutina es gloria, me tiré de la noria

Lo intento porque siento
Porque vivo en movimiento
En busca del momento mediante la constancia

En la casa, en la almohada
En el alba de la mañana
Todos renaceremos un millón de veces

Y la suerte compadece cada instante
Ese perfume se convierte en diferente
Si mis fotos son contigo, un pequeño visitante
Un ambiente diferente, y la vida por delante
La suerte de tenerte, la suerte de escucharte

La suerte, la fortuna, el destino, el azar
La estrella, el acaso, la casualidad

Dans cette ville aux 10 000 cités, aux mille et une filles

Je suis juste un objet qui fait oh
Et puis un jour on nous a sortis
On s'y attendait plus, endormis
Cachés dans un sac, tranquilles
Je sais qu'on allait être achetés à bas prix
Y'a l'fusil qui panique qui veut pas
Faire la guerre en Afrique
Nous c'est la loterie, la loi du trafic
On n'est pas un lot de bijouterie
J'ai pas fini autour du cou
D'un people sous ectasy
Mais dans les mains d'un môme de vingt piges
Jusqu'à cette descente de flics
Où ils m'ont sorti de en dessous du lit
Où j'ai vu mes semblables pointer le p'tit
Ni vi ni connu on m'a mis avec le gib'
J'ai attendu le placard
Mais on m'a vendu à une fille
Elle était pas d'ici
Comme moi étrangère en exil
Et elle m'a plue
Elle était si fragile
Mais son mac j'aurai aimé l'finir
Quand il l'a frappait, prenait la tune

Et menacait sa famille
Elle et moi je voulais croire
Que c'était pour la vie
Maintenant elle est partie
Je m'sens seul et triste
Je croyais pouvoir la défendre
Et je suis comme un fou
J'réalise qu'elle m'a acheté
Pour mettre fin à ses jours
J'en ai marre d'être un objet qui fait peur
C'est pas ma faute, moi
Si l'on est fasciné par ma force
Je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
Je suis juste un objet qui fait oh
C'est pas ma faute, moi
Si l'on est fasciné par ma force

Faf Larage,"Aucun visage ne me regarde
Et sur les quelques pièces que je glane
A la sortie des magasins, après l’office
Le côté face aussi me donne le profil

Le soleil tombe avec les degrés
Depuis ce matin je marche, mais là mes pieds sont las, il faudrait que je pense à me poser
Que je me trouve un porche ou un coin tranquille, bien abrité
A l’écart des regards, la tolérance est souvent mal imitée
Parfois j’aimerais être invisible tout comme ces fantômes
Ne pas voir ces yeux, qui ne me regardent pas comme on regarde un homme
«Bonjour madame, n’ayez pas peur, non, je ne suis pas dangereux 
Je vous tiens la porte c’est tout, c’est pas à votre sac que j’en veux»
C’est qu’un « bonjour», ça ne vous coûtera pas 1 €
Allez fouillez votre cœur, y a encore peut-être quelques mercis
Je vous jure c’est pas de ma faute si tout le pays par en vrille
Je suis là par manque de chance, la vie a ses sombres héros
Comme une ombre au tableau, je croise des routes sans jamais laisser de trace
S’il vous plaît, voyez moi, une fois avant que le vieux ne m’efface
Je sais c’est dur car vous me percevez comme un peut-être
Alors c’est presque par instinct que vous tournez la tête
C’est vrai je dors là, où vos chiens ont leur chiottes
Je gêne les amoureux qui sur les bancs, le soir se bécotent
Et si le vent parfois me force à squatter vos entrées
N’oubliez pas, même les vaincus ont droit au respect
Et si le dédain était armé, je serais mort 1000 fois
Comme ceux qu’on trouve le matin gelés et morts de froid
Mais là c’est pire ma présence ne choque même plus
Le temps défile et doucement je deviens une simple habitude

On ne me voit plus, je suis transparent, une habitude
Les regards glissent, sur mes affaires entassées sur ce trottoir vide
C’est tout ce qui me reste, mon testament
On ne me voit plus, je suis une silhouette
Une ombre sans utilité
Comme disent hommes et femmes pleins de futilités
Je ne suis qu’une habitude, ou aucun pas ne s’arrête

On vit l’hiver gelés par la honte
Le froid et l’été, l’indifférence des passants nous fait de l’ombre
Sur un trottoir, un banc on dérange, chacun sa croix
Une pièce, de l’eau courante, un trésor qu’on ne trouve pas
Le soir on marche en petit groupe, livrés à nous-mêmes
Rien qui nous retient ici, ni maison, ni repères
Nos souvenirs, nos joies dans des sacs poubelles
On brave le quotidien et voit nos espoirs à la baisse
On fuit la loi et l’ordre qui nous chassent parce qu’on n’a plus de sous
Ils ont saisi ma dignité avec mes biens un jour
Depuis je vous regarde, faire semblant de ne pas me voir et ça me marque
Plus que le temps à tuer sur le goudron une tache dans ce parc
Vos non dits qui en disent long me rattrapent
Et parmi nous beaucoup se résignent face au mépris, ils signent
Pour une idylle avec une bouteille vide
On ne juge pas, on a tous une histoire, je ne vous le souhaite pas
Je pourrais être vous, vous pourriez être moi
Alors je rêve devant les vitrines, tant pis si c’est pour de faux
Je sais que la rue ne fait pas de cadeau
J’essaie d’être fort même dans le caniveau
Je ne suis qu’une statue de chair parmi vous
Et à la fin j’aurais jouer mon rôle jusqu’au bout
Mais les spectateurs m’ont fait défaut

On ne me voit plus, je suis transparent, une habitude
Les regards glissent, sur mes affaires entassées sur ce trottoir vide
C’est tout ce qui me reste, mon testament
On ne me voit plus, je suis une silhouette

A 40 piges qu'est-ce que je fous au milieu des kids?
Coincés dans la tise, nos futurs, le trottoir c'est le Ritz!

Histoires de meurtres et de coke

Où glissent mes shoes, évite les shoot

Et la Police déboule, les bandes rivales se toisent et mobilisent les troupes
Pendant que les voisins de palier économisent des couches
Les revers du sort renversent la coupe
Quand les tordus la relèvent c'est que le Démon y sert sa soupe
On y connait les escaliers, les coins, les porches
Pas les hommes, maintenant c'est la règle, on s'en bat des autres
Je ne peux pas être de ce que les mômes encensent
Et finir est impensant comme les étoiles de mon enfance
Faire du mal aux autres, escroqué les potes

T'imagines plein plein de fric
Et ça t'inspire tout à grande vitesse

Tu vois des liasses épaisses comme des rouleaux de P.Q
Mais parle pas de retraite au numéro de sécu

Ébloui par les chromes sur la B.M

Fafá de Belém,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Poeira de Estrelas,1994

Linha nova que pai comprou

Não fique triste, menino

Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Yet it wasn't enough for you
All the love I had to give
I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried
I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, You won't find me being the one 
Who gets lost
Once I had so much to give
But You just refused my love

Que me incendeia o corpo de alegria
Lá vem a santa maldita euforia
Que me alucina, me joga e me rodopia

Lá vem o canto, o berro de fera
Lá vem a voz de qualquer primavera
Lá vem a unha rasgando a garganta
A fome, a fúria, o sangue que já se levanta

De onde vem essa coisa tão minha
Que me aquece e me faz carinho?
De onde vem essa coisa tão crua
Que me acorda e me põe no meio da rua?

É um lamento, um canto mais puro
Que me ilumina a casa escura
É minha força, é nossa energia
Que vem de longe prá nos fazer companhia

É Clementina cantando bonito
As aventuras do seu povo aflito
É Seu Francisco, boné e cachimbo
Me ensinando que a luta é mesmo comigo

E fecho os olhos, para todos os teus passos
Me enganando, só assim somos amigos

Por quantas vezes, me da raiva te querer

Se van perdiendo

Porque años atrás

Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
Hacía parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos

A nada digo que no

Que pone viejo los corazones

Mais longe vai o meu pensamento
Em busca da força do alimento
Morena, bastava ao menos um beijo
Um beijo matava esta saudade
Que aqui dentro do meu peito, ai
Ai, ai, ai, no meu peito
Xôm saudade, sai, me deixa em paz

Vê se vai lá pras bandas do Japão
No Japão chega na beira da ilha
E olha o sol nascer lua por aqui
É que agora cê tá por perto não
E ai vai morrer de ser saudade
E aqui meu amor me deu a mão
Ai, ai, ai, meu amor me deu a mão",Saudade,1998
Fagner,"A mão que toca um violão 
Se for preciso faz a guerra
Mata o mundo fere a Terra

A voz que canta uma canção 
Se for preciso canta um hino

Louva a morte

Viola em noite enluarada 
No sertão é como espada

Esperança de vingança

O mesmo pé que dança um samba 
Se preciso vai à luta
Capoeira

Quem tem de noite a companheira
Sabe que a paz é passageira
Pra defendê-la se levanta 
E grita: Eu vou!

Mão, violão, canção, espada E viola enluarada
Pelo campo e cidade
Porta-bandeira, capoeira desfilando 
Vão cantando
Liberdade
Liberdade",Viola Enluarada,1998
Fagner,"Dona da minha cabeça 
Ela vem com um carnaval
E toda paixão recomeça, ela é bonita
É demais

Não há um porto seguro,
Um futuro, também não há
Mas faz tanta diferença
Quando ela dança, dança ...

Eu digo e ela não acredita
Ela é bonita demais
Eu digo e ela não acredita
Ela é bonita, é bonita

Dona da minha cabeça
Quero tanto lhe ver chegar
Quero saciar minha sede
Milhões de vezes, milhões de vezes ...

Na força dessa beleza
É que eu sinto firmeza e paz
Por isso nunca disapareça
Nunca me esqueça, não te esqueço jamais

Eu digo e ela não acredita
Ela é bonita demais
Eu digo e ela não acredita
Ela é bonita, é bonita",Dona da Minha Cabeça,1999
Fagner,"Não sei
Não sabe ninguém
Porque canto fado
Neste tom magoado
De dor e de pranto
E nesse tormento
Todo o sofrimento
Eu sinto que alma
Cá dentro se acalma
Nos versos que canto

Foi Deus
Que deu luz aos olhos
Perfumou a rosa
Deu ouro ao sol
E prata ao luar
Foi Deus
Que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas
Que vou desfiando
E choro a cantar

Pôs estrelas no céu
Fez o espaço sem fim
Deu luto às andorinhas
Ai
Deu-me esta voz a mim

Se canto
Não sei o que canto
Misto de ventura
Saudade e ternura
Ou talvez amor
Mas sei que cantando
Sinto o mesmo quando
Se tenho um desgosto
E o pranto no rosto
Nos deixa melhor

Foi Deus
Que deu voz ao vento
Luz ao firmamento
E pôs o azul
Nas ondas do mar

Foi Deuss
Que me pôs no peito
Um rosário de penas
Que vou desfiando
E choro a cantar

Fez poeta o rouxinol
Pôs no campo o alecrim
Deu as flores a primavera
Aiiiiiiiiii
Deu-me essa voz a mim",Foi Deus,1999
Fagner,"Tenho um coração
Dividido entre a esperança e a razão
Tenho um coração
Bem melhor que não tivera

Esse coração
Não consegue se conter ao ouvir tua voz
Pobre coração
Sempre escravo da ternura

Quem dera ser um peixe
Para em teu límpido aquário mergulhar
Fazer borbulhas de amor pra te encantar
Passar a noite em claro
Dentro de ti

Um peixe
Para enfeitar de corais tua cintura
Fazer silhuetas de amor à luz da lua
Saciar esta loucura
Dentro de ti

Canta, coração
Que esta alma necessita de ilusão
Sonha, coração
Não te enchas de amargura

Esse coração
Não consegue se conter ao ouvir tua voz
Pobre coração
Sempre escravo da ternura

Uma noite
Para unir-nos até o fim
Cara a cara, beijo a beijo
E viver para sempre
Dentro de ti",Borbulhas de Amor (Tenho Um Coração),2000
Fagner,"Um homem também chora
Menina morena
Também deseja colo
Palavras amenas
Precisa de carinho
Precisa de ternura
Precisa de um abraço
Da própria candura

Guerreiros são pessoas
São fortes, são frágeis
Guerreiros são meninos
No fundo do peito
Precisam de um descanso
Precisam de um remanso
Precisam de um sonho
Que os tornem refeitos

É triste ver este homem
Guerreiro menino
Com a barra de seu tempo
Por sobre seus ombros
Eu vejo que ele berra
Eu vejo que ele sangra
A dor que traz no peito
Pois ama e ama

Um homem se humilha
Se castram seu sonho
Seu sonho é sua vida
E a vida é trabalho
E sem o seu trabalho
Um homem não tem honra
E sem a sua honra
Se morre, se mata
Não dá pra ser feliz
Não dá pra ser feliz",Guerreiro Menino (Um Homem Também Chora),2000
Fagner,"Só uma coisa me entristece
O beijo de amor que eu não roubei
A jura secreta que eu não fiz
A briga de amor que eu não causei

Nada do que posso me alucina
Tanto quanto o que não fiz
Nada do que quero me suprime
Do que por não saber que ainda não quis

Só uma palavra me devora
Aquela que o meu coração não diz
Só o que me cega, oque me faz infeliz
É o brilho do olhar que eu não sofri",Jura Secreta,2000
Fagner,"As velas do Mucuripe, vão sair para pescar
Vou levar as minhas mágoas, pras águas fundas do mar
Hoje a noite namorar, sem ter medo da saudade
E sem vontade de casar

Calça nova de riscado, paletó de linho branco
Que ate o mês passado, lá no campo ainda era flor
Sob o meu chapéu quebrado, um sorriso ingênuo e franco
De um rapaz, novo e encantado, com vinte anos de amor

Aquela estrela é dela
Vida, vento, vela, leva-me daqui ...",Mucuripe,2000
Fagner,"O aço dos meus olhos e o fel das minhas palavras
Acalmaram meu silêncio mas deixaram suas marcas
Se hoje eu sou deserto, é que eu não sabia
Que as flores com o tempo, perdem a força
E a ventania vem mais forte

Hoje eu só acredito no pulsar das minhas veias
E aquela luz que havia em cada ponto de partida
Há muito me deixou, há muito me deixou

Ai, coração alado
Desfolharei meus olhos neste escuro véu
Não acredito mais no fogo ingênuo da paixão
São tantas ilusões perdidas na lembrança

Nesta estrada só quem pode me seguir sou eu
Sou eu, sou eu, sou eu ...

Ai, coração alado...",Noturno,2000
Fagner,"Quem é rico mora na praia 
mas quem trabalha nem tem onde morar
Quem não chora dorme com fome 
mas quem tem nome joga prata no ar

Ô tempo duro no ambiente 
ô tempo escuro na memória
o tempo é quente
E o dragão é voraz

Vamos embora de repente
vamos embora sem demora
Vamos pra frente que pra trás não dá mais

Pra ser feliz num lugar

É que as pedras vão cantar

Fagner,"Eu só queria
Que você fosse um dia
Ver as praias bonitas do meu Ceará

Tenho certeza
Que você gostaria
Dos mares bravios
Das praias de lá

Onde o coqueiro
Tem palma bem verde
Balançando ao vento
Pertinho do céu
E lá nasceu a virgem do poema
A linda Iracema dos lábios de mel

Oh! Quanta saudade 
Que eu tenho de lá
Oh! Quanta saudade

A jangadinha vai no mar deslizando
O pescador o peixe vai pescando
O verde mar
Que não tem fim
No Ceará é assim",No Ceará É Assim,2003
Fagner,"Nem sempre andei assim
Nem sempre fui tristeza
Às vezes andei com os pés no chão
Às vezes fui certeza

Nem sempre quis ser só
Nem sempre quis ser seu
Às vezes quis evitar sem dor
A hora do adeus

Mas faz de conta que ainda há tempo
Que a noite é eterna
Mas faz de conta que o tarde é cedo
O agora não espera

Fagner,"No sertão da minha terra, fazenda é o camarada que ao chão se deu
Fez a obrigação com força, parece até que tudo aquilo ali é seu
Só poder sentar no morro e ver tudo verdinho, lindo a crescer
Orgulhoso camarada, de viola em vez de enxada

Filho do branco e do preto, correndo pela estrada atrás de passarinho
Pela plantação adentro, crescendo os dois meninos, sempre pequeninos
Peixe bom dá no riacho de água tão limpinha, dá pro fundo ver
Orgulhoso camarada, conta histórias pra moçada

Filho do senhor vai embora, tempo de estudos na cidade grande
Parte, tem os olhos tristes, deixando o companheiro na estação distante
Não esqueça, amigo, eu vou voltar, some longe o trenzinho ao deus-dará

Quando volta já é outro, trouxe até sinhá mocinha pra apresentar
Linda como a luz da lua que em lugar nenhum rebrilha como lá
Já tem nome de doutor, e agora na fazenda é quem vai mandar
E seu velho camarada, já não brinca, mas trabalha",Morro Velho,2005
Fagner,"Vejo tua boa com desejo
Teus olhos com cuidado

No verso de um bolero

Olha, que mundo tão pequeno
O amor foi tão sereno
Me trouxe até você
Quero, te quero
Tanto que desespero
Feito Roma, feito Nero

The road that lay before you, solution seemed so near
Then you got elected, you still can hear the cheers

Tell me why do you live a lie
You are acting blind

Tell me what did you find now you're out in the cold
Does your promise still hold
And what did you do, you find yourself telling lies
While a million hungry eyes are watching you

Some men would do anything to keep their golden crown
Are you really one of them, are you laughing at the crowd?
You close your eyes to all the things you once believed were true
And say I would forgive you if I would wear your shoes

And that's why he plays so good

And no magician he
Will play for you some magic notes

Song behind you'll hear
And to the rhythm of guitar
We hope you'll lend an ear

So, come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth
And move the rolling sky

Well, the man who plays the bass does make
Those low notes that you hear
And the high notes come from you and me
For we will sing so clear

And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the earth

Is a dozen nice fat snails

Whose tastes in food are very much wider
You'll see a smile light up his face
At a couple of kippers and a glass of cider

With my gun on my shoulder to the woods I did stray
In search of some game if the weather proved fair
To see could I get a shot at the bonny black hare

And her skin was as fair as the lily that blows

Can you tell me where the bonny black hare do go?""
Oh, the answer she gave me, her answer was ""No
But it's under me apron they say it do go
And if you'll not deceive me I vow and declare
We'll both go together to hunt the bonny black hare""
Well, I laid this girl down with her face to the sky
And I took out my ramrod and my bullets likewise
I says ""Lock your legs round me and dig in with your heels
For the closer we get, oh, the better it feels""

And the song that they sang was ""Oh, she's easy to please""
I felt her heart quiver and I knew what I'd done
Says I ""Have you had enough of my old sporting gun?""
Oh, the answer she gave me, her answer was ""Nay
It's not often young sportsmen like you come this way
And if your powder is willing and your bullets play fair
Why don't you keep firing at the bonny black hare?""

As to the waves they're tossed.

Oh they are all gentlemen,
And never will they know
If there is a reason each of them must go,
To join the cruel flow.

And it'll take a long, long time.
It'll take a long, long time.
It'll take a long, long time.
Oh it'll take such a long, long time.

There is no need for rules,
There's no-one to score the game
And there is nobody living in this town
As even knows its name.

Oh it'll take such a long, long time.
It'll take a long, long time.
It'll take a long, long time.
A long, long time.",It'll Take a Long Time [*],1972
Fairport Convention,"Roses are red, and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz.
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world,
And the heroine waits 
For her beau to return,
And violins play 
From behind garden walls,
How I'd love to remain 
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz.

As they dance round the floor,
And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more 
And there's never a care,
By the perfect lagoon 
Where the nightingale calls,
With only the moon 
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz.

Roses are red and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,

Fairport Convention,"Time stood dark and silent and the stars they gave no light
I wandered in an endless dream, haunted by the night
I saw four ghostly riders, the horses in a line
Each in turn did point at me and say I'm on full ?rein?
We are the sculptors of the land, the rulers of the sea
We are the falcons of your sins, gardeners of the trees
The air about you is burning and the sea below does drown
And the legacy you leave your ?swan? will surely bring 'em down
Bring 'em down Bring 'em down Bring 'em down
Bring 'em down Bring 'em down Bring 'em down
A curse upon you men of war, with gun or pen in hand
The power sword or . . . the castles made of sand
You always have good reason to take more than you need
Your hearts are full of paper and your minds are full of greed
Bring 'em down Bring 'em down Bring 'em down
Bring 'em down Bring 'em down Bring 'em down
What is deeper than the ocean, colder than the grave
Stronger than your armies all and braver than the brave?
Those who know and ?knowing know? will sow on fertile ground
Those who don't and never would are those you will go down
Bring 'em down Bring 'em down Bring 'em down
Bring 'em down Bring 'em down Bring 'em down

Fairport Convention,"[Chorus]
Pleasure and pain is like profit and gain
Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

The coach that I ride has a horseman who's tired
The reins to his hands they are tied
The one to alight, if he's lucky, he might
Learn to slow down and drift with the tide

[Chorus]

It's ever so low when there's nowhere to go
And your spirit lies close to the ground
Take a long look behind, I'm sure you'll find
A friend there who'll help pull you round

[Chorus]

You have to agree, it's not easy to see
A sheep underneath all that fleece
If you'll take my advice, stick with people you like
It's a big world, you're only one piece

Fairport Convention,"Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Feels like a break-up, you're taking up time
Don't say you told her, ?you? still you love her
Oh, that's where you've been, I hadn't seen all the signs
You swear you've changed then you tell me again
That it's you I can trust, for you must think that I'm blind
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time
Stop all the schooling, just keep it cool and
Believe what I say though it may seem unkind
Too late for pleading, ?I just want some peace?
And go find a new friend 'cause it's the end of the line
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time
Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause

Fairport Convention,"When love, with unconfined wings, hovers within my gates
And my divine ALTHEA brings to whisper at my grates
When I lie tangled in her hair and fettered with her eye
Birds that wanton in the air know no such liberty
When flowing cups run swiftly round with no allaying THAMES
Our careless heads with roses crowned, our hearts with royal flames
When first decreeth in wine we steep when healths and rafts run free
Fishes that tipple in the deep know no such liberty
Stone walls do not a prison make not iron bars a gate
Minds innocent and quiet take that as a hermitage
If I have freedom in my love and in my soul am free
Angels alone that soar above enjoy such liberty",To Althea from Prison,1973

Fairport Convention,"As the cafe was closing
On a warm summer night
And Cathy was cleaning the spoons
The radio played the hit parade
And I hummed a long with the tune
She asked me to change the station
Said the song just drove her insane
But it weren't just the music playing
It was me that she was trying to blame

[Chorus:]
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But it's far, far from me

Well, I leaned on my left leg
In the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A June bug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second to long

[Chorus:]

Well, I started the engine
And I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse
Well, we hadn't gone far in my beat old car
And I was prepared for the worst.
""Will you still see me tomorrow?""
""No, I got too much to do""
Well, a question ain't really a question
If you know the answer too

Fairport Convention,"Red and gold and Halloween have passed us by
The charcoal branches lean against the rosy sky
You are so far away and I could touch you if I may
But don't you worry now, I'm only dreaming anyway
You may be lonely, you may be just on your own
It could be anywhere, some place that I have know
But who am I and do we really live these days at all
And are they simply feelings we have learnt and do recall
Oh, the sea has made me cry

But I love her too, so maybe I love you
Tears are only made of salt and water
And across the waves the sound of laughter
October has gone and left me with a song
That I will sing to you although the moment may be wrong
Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway
Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway",After Halloween,1975

Sunlight bled upon the silence
From the blackest night
Must come the morning sky

But yesterday was such a long time
Yesterday may last forever
From the barren land
Yesterday might always rise

Sleep, will we ever sleep
Oh, to sleep in peace once again my love
Tears are falling in the darkness
Hearts are bleeding in the silence

From the widest ocean
Who would miss this smallest tear
Then might always be a bad time
Then might always last forever

But these stormy clouds
We may see them all disappear

Will she ever come back again my love

Oh, to sleep in peace once again to love
Hope has she really gone
Will she ever come home again my love",Dawn,1975

Restlessness has ruled me since I can't remember when
There's something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again

There are dreams that I have carried all my lifetime
And the dreams have made me a stranger
In the eyes of many a man
For I do not count the time and my reasons do not rhyme

And down the line and on my way, on my way again
Oh, rolling along like a shipwrecked sailor
Who never finds a home
Broken lines and signs of failure

Rub me to the bone
Well, I'm weary of the company of strangers
I'm weary of the city with its heart of hollow stone
Something in the wind seems to call me like a friend

So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
There's something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again

I travel over the sea and ride the rolling sky
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon
There's a heart in every place, there's a tear for each farewell
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
I'll lure you as the lace that the wayward gypsies sell
With the sinking of the sun, rising of the moon

Rising for the moon, the sun has set and it is dark
But the star of the enchanted tune is bright as any spark
The chorus of the dusk regail the evening lark
Whose every day does start rising for the moon

For that's the way it is, that is our fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon

Fairport Convention,"He was a stranger to himself
A spy in his own camp
And his money was his health
All thrown to the dust by his very own hand

Yet his beauty lingered still
Beyond the draining of the sand
But greener was the other side of the hill
Richer was the other man's land

But we loved him, loved him just like brothers would
We loved him, loved him like no others could
And she loved him, loved him like a lover should
Take good care of an aching heart

You never can replace it
You know you are the master of your heart
You'll realise that when you think it fit
Those orbs of blue are jading away

No laughter from them dances
Yet you're bound to remember this one day
Hazards are risks and risks are chances
You can run for cover, run for cover like a frightened hare

Till it's all over, all over and there's no-one there

Silver tongues are speaking long and hard into the night
I must be myself and I'll do alright
Oh, please my darling, do not make me sad
Late at night nobody really wants to feel that bad

I must close my ears or I'll go insane
Can't you be a gentle breeze or silent as a snowfall
Won't you try and listen for the voice behind the wall
It cries to you

Even though it only ever whispers part of what it knows
And it's never ventured through the locks
Where the brazen river flows
It's the fingerprint which is never made
It's the perfume of a rose

As the night is black, as the day is white
Please my friend, help to make me glad
Help me find the one and only thing I've never had

But it's I who must try not
To send you away.

Where I have never travelled
