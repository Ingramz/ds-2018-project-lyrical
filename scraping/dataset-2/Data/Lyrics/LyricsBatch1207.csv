Tom Mega,"Les vieux ne parlent plus 
Ou alors seulement 
Parfois du bout des yeux,
Même riches ils sont pauvres, 
Ils n'ont plus d'illusions, 
Et n'ont qu'un cœur pour deux.
Chez eux ça sent le thym, 
Le propre, la lavande, 
Et le verbe d'antan,
Que l'on vive à Paris, 
On vit tous en province 
Quand on vit trop longtemps.
Est-ce d'avoir trop ri 
Que leur voix se lézarde 
Quand ils parlent d'hier?
Et d'avoir trop pleuré 
Que des larmes encore 
Leur perlent les paupières?
Et s'ils tremblent un peu 
Est-ce de voir vieillir 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui dit ""Je vous attends"".

Les vieux ne rêvent plus, 
Leurs livres s'ensommeillent, 
Leurs pianos sont fermés,
Le petit chat est mort. 
Le muscat du dimanche 
Ne les fait plus chanter,
Les vieux ne bougent plus, 
Leurs gestes ont trop de rides, 
Leur monde est trop petit,
Du lit à la fenêtre, 
Puis du lit au fauteuil, 
Et puis du lit au lit,
Et s'ils sortent encore 
Bras dessus, bras dessous, 
Tout habillés de raide,
C'est pour suivre au soleil 
L'enterrement d'un plus vieux, 
L'enterrement d'une plus laide,
Et le temps d'un sanglot 
Oublier toute une heure 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui les attend.

Les vieux ne meurent pas, 
Ils s'endorment un jour 
Et dorment trop longtemps,
Ils se tiennent la main, 
Ils ont peur de se perdre, 
Et se perdent pourtant
Et l'autre reste là, 
Le meilleur ou le pire, 
Le doux ou le sévère,
Cela n'importe pas, 
Celui des deux qui reste 
Se retrouve en enfer.
Vous le verrez peut-être, 
Vous le verrez parfois 
En pluie et en chagrin
Traverser le présent. 
En s'excusant déjà 
De n'être pas plus loin.
Et fuir devant vous 
Une dernière fois 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui leur dit ""Je t'attends"",
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui nous attend",Les Vieux,1992
Tom Melito,"Evening, every night you come and you find me
And you always remind me that my baby's gone
Evening, you got me deeply in your power
Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Oh evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my man is gone

Tom Melito,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

Tom Melito,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else),1992
Tom Michael,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, cant you see, I'm in love

Life's a beautiful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love

Tom Michael,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon/Moonglow,2000
Tom Michael,"How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

How can I be sure?  I really really really wanna know.
I really really really wanna know.  Oh.

Tom Michael,"Time, I've been passing time
Watching trains go by.
All of my life, 
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly.
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me.

Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life...

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life,
Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you.
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before

Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you
All of my life
It's you
It's you
I've been waiting for all of my life

Tom Michael,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars/Written in the Stars,2003
Tom Middleton,"We can walk for miles
We can talk for days
Learn about each other always 

And though we walk for miles
And we talk for days
Sometimes we let pride get in our way

And for a while something is broken and missing
And I can't tell what's goin' on in your mind 

It ain't easy
Getting it right
It ain't easy
Trying to read the signs
It ain't easy
Trying to work out what's going on in your mind

And though we live and learn
Love is give and take
We fall into confusion some days

Where there's fear and need
We keep it all inside
Sometimes we let pride get in our way

And for a while something is broken and missing
And I can't tell what's goin' on in your mind

It ain't easy
Getting it right
It ain't easy

Trying to work out what's going on in your mind",It Ain't Easy [Cosmos Remix],2000

Tom Middleton,"What is that sound
Ringing in my ears?
The strangest sound
I've heard for years and years
The sound of two hearts
Beating side by side
The sound of one love
That neither one can hide

The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round

What is that sound
Running round my head?
Funny, I thought
That part was long since dead
But now there's new life
Coursing through my veins
Because there's someone
To make it beat again

The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round
The sound that makes the world go 'round

What is that sound
Ringing in my ears?
The strangest sound
I've heard for years and years
The sound of two hearts
Beating side by side
The sound of one love
That neither one can hide",What Sound [Tom Middleton Vox],2008
Tom Misch,"It's been a minute since I've been with some women
Not 'cause they been lacking, just I've been lacking the feelin'
I've been staring at the ceiling
Listen to the chat that they're revealing
Wondering if I open up or keep concealing
I ain't try to be demeaning
It seems
Thought you knew dis
I don't really do dis
Moving like a Judas
Talking all that talk
But ain't no time for acting foolish
When you ask of all the brothers saying ""true dis""
I might just jump on this for free
Jumping on them freestyle
I've been well
Moving brain, senile
It's sole sunsets
Beautiful is one guess
One morning afternoon in that sun dress
Summer flies by
Every morning, I'm still yawning
Same conversation, never boring
(Yo, she texted you, swear? Nah it's Tomen, ah for fuck's sake)

I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you

Ay, and then you say you ain't about guys
Ay, especially brothers from the south side
But been about mine
Ever since the drought now
You and me been living on this cloud nine
Saying it's about time
Stunting, front light
Nothing will change until it drains
Ain't noting the same
'Cause you become like the blood in my veins
Saying I'm way too young
To be stuck on the rain
But still it's peak
Weeks 'til I figured out you played keys
Eighteen, you been listening to Jay Dee
Blaming the bait trees
Telling me you hate these
G's but didn't need me telling you they ain't me
Because they ain't me, they ain't me
Don't need to know about the colours that they paint me
I've been too busy getting dizzy off that JD
Dreaming of the places you could take me, so now I'm sayin'

I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you",Damselfly,2017
Tom Misch,"If you're starting to try to be a musician or artist
Something like that, because you wanna make money, 
Because you wanna do a job, that's- that's the wrong way
You have to do this because you love it
And it doesn't matter if you broke, you still gon' do it
I mean, I go out to jam sessions, and I play
Regardless of whether I'm getting a check or not
It's, it's about whether I, uh, you have to love this thing, man! 
You have to love it, and breathe it and
It's, it's your morning coffee, it's your- it's your food
That's why you become an artist
Art is a mirror of society, you know",Before Paris,2018

Tom Misch,"One, two, three, four

I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There’s something in this sound that takes me far
It’s like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar

She told me add a bass line
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I’ll go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful

You can’t take this away from me
The way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun when winter stars

She told me add a bass line
And everything will be alright
She told me that the beat is mine
It will rock us through the night
And where I go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful

You can’t take this away from me
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me 
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity

Hey! You can’t take this away from me

The waves bring clarity
Running through me

You can’t take this away from me 
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
(Just running through me)

Yo, I wear notes like coats
Blues like doos, war for the rhythm, soul that glues
That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
The hop is my home, rap is my grind
I'm grindin' on the back side of life, we dance
She threw me a chance, my hands in my pants
Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight, whispering a dream I could hold in the night
(Look tight) a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
Wake up and write it on the pad, the pains
Like church, the organ will invite the tears
(Like birth) the cryin' let you know I'm here
Held by the song that gave me a name
Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
(There’s just base in the line) safe to inhale
And if you live well
Then longer years in this state, you will be
A timeless octave to play for the tree
That’s rooted in every single nerve in me
The nerve of he who ignores the key
And use it, it opens the minds that be free
Whenever you're hot-headed, pours you a breeze
Beneath the clouds, you allowed to see in clarity, through harmony
Someone harmin’ me?
That won't be done
I stand protected by the laws of fun
I am perfected through the rhymes of run
Walkin' this way had the party stunned
This music, it launched me
With no aim, I've landed with some plane
Where I am I can't explain or ever know
But it's beautiful so

You can’t take this away from me
oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me (come on, yo)
You can’t take this away from me
oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity

Tom Misch,"""My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platforms into the dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop!'
To run across to him, to take him in my arms
To tell him, 'I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
Those little curls on the back of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life, forever""

I hope
That the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote, to you
Everyday, did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby, do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me, come back to me

Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me, or was it mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me, or was it mystery

I heard
That you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
I can't ignore, the time
May have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby, come back to me, come back to me

What would you realize
What you meant to me, or was it mystery

With the chains and the gold
We could be out here together
But, you have places to go

Watching the sunshine blaze the gray

You should come south of the river
Where the loving is gold

You should come south of the river
This is where it all starts
I think that we could stay here forever

Swimming with these times
The grooves that turn the grey to sunshine
'Cause I would live through days that break me
Swimming with these times
The grooves that turn the grey to sunshine

I'm still tryna write the story as I see it
The trouble is when I say it, they don't believe it
The reckon I only say it but I don't mean it
I'm tryna tell 'em I'd only say it if I can feel it
'Cause money's tight, maybe tighter than it was before
I'm helping out on a mortgage I really can't afford
Family breaking north, I cover the trips abroad
Shakin', I'm making another loss on another tour
But what I done it for?
To see my mother in the sun abroad
I run into trouble, it was coming for
My little brother got the hunger for
All the exact same pain
That makes the rain my stomach pour
So let me paint it broader
This for any dude who's got a daughter
Living off lines that your papa taught her
Ain't got no time to be coming for you
Go with the flow of this running water

Go with the flow with this
Go with the flow with this
Go with the flow of this

Don't you worry
Two leaves won't grow the same
And people might forget your name
Doesn't matter if they do
Don't you hurry
When the hot coffee pours will stain
And when the Uber left you in the rain
Your time will come around to you
Despite the stress of spending so much time alone
'Cause this geography is keeping me at home
And I don't know the way to go
I move with the flow of this running water, this running water

'Cause I was born a water baby

Tom Morello,"Blastmaster Kris, I don't talk ish.
Expand your consciousness and dismiss foolishness.
No one is new to this or new to Kris.
In hip-hop's atomic structure I am the nucleus.
That is the center of the group we, us.
They, them, you, every squad, every massive, every crew.
Dental floss is lost when a true rapper jumps off.
The cash is incidental, but not mental distract you off course.
The style that I am kickin' is like chicken.
It will be bitten, rewritten, then performed for a twenty-five dollar admission;
Reviewed in The Source.
You will listen, then find somethin' missin' of course... it's skills;
That's what you're fishin' for, it's lost.
I'm gettin' too explicit; the track jingles.
I won't do a wack album, then remix it for my single.
Kickin' rhymes till I wrinkle, and my brown eyes twinkle.
God called hip-hop for the nine-cinco.

Tasty like a soufflé french croisant on Tuesday.
Rappers be boo-tay.
Goo-fy, that's how they crew stay;
Bitin' whatever you say to boost they ego.
We know the steelo; your whole character is foul.
Makes me want to shoot a free throw; blaow!
From the git go, no, get go, my flow hits low.
Wherever all the dope shit go; there's where my shit go.
Bee-dee-bee-bo, skank, I think;
Self with ya groups, everyone else, and the bank.
Others like to bring the shottie to the party;
I bring knowledge of self; you cure the mind; you cure the body.
Some rappers like to come to the party hopin' to leave with somebody.
Check, I come with skills, and I leave with your motherfuckin' respect.
Ahh yeah... so check, uh!

New types of verbal hip-hop I bring.
When you know you can sing, boy, you know you can sing.
I do not clutter up the airwaves with stacks of useless facts.
MC's trying to be macks, but acts like ignorant blacks;
Freak that, I'll snap your back as it cracks.
You will experience loss or lack of balance.
Stop the violence; fry from week to week like an allowance.
All of you are cowards; hiding behind the mask of MC.
I remember, thinkin' back to eighty-three;
No video; no you had to be a real, live, MC.
Now you younguns grow up buggin' any new jock you're huggin'
Weak production; let me tell you somethin'.
Any MC can battle for glory,
But to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story.

Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten and the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

Can you explain to the mothers and the fathers of those
Who come riding home in coffins in their military clothes?
Shiny medals pinned to their dead teenage chests
While the trumpets blare and you lie your best
So ask all you want from the dusk till the dawn
The answer's still, no, 'cause, brother, I'm gone

Battle hymns for the broken, battle hymns for the misled
Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten and the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

Can you explain away the sleight of hand and the criminality
Of spending souls for oil? Well, in the mirror I can see
I am the path that leads down, I am the dark and bloody hall
I'm the reaper, executioner, hangman, judge and the law
So tie a yellow ribbon 'round the oak tree on the lawn
But the cavalry's not comin' 'cause, brother, they're gone

Battle hymns for the broken, battle hymns for the misled
Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten and the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

So I'm sharpening my shovel, I'm firing the kiln
I'm blind and I am purposeful, a martyr on the hill
The dream you might be dreaming might be someone else's dream tonight
I'm the whisperer of misgivings, I'm the fading tail light
I'm the call for retribution from the back of the smoke filled hall
I'm the vow of bitterness, I'm the poison in the well

I've a photographic memory of the deeds I will avenge
I'm the cold in the river hollow, I've a hat-pin, I've a plan
I don't care of cause or consequence, head shaved and body lean
I'm the go-getter, the score settler, I'm the shadow on the green
And there's a flock of blackbirds flying, nearly ten thousand strong
Who set off this morning and, brother, they're gone

Battle hymns for the wretched, the forgotten, for the dead
Battle hymns of redemption of solidarity and pride
Battle hymns we will be singing at the turning of the tide

Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
Waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
Got a one-way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the city aqueduct

Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries

Or decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free

Tom Morello,"Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, ""This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem.""
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, I heard the hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, God is in heaven
And we all want what's his
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I'm gazing out the window
Of the St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues

Tom Morello,"Right before your eyes witness the travesty
The perpetrators of the crime are simply walking away
How the defenders of justice keep falling,
And again, and again, and again, and again you know

That no one can deny
The horrors of our age
The puppets' intricate lies will never wash them away
They can't distract us from from all that's appalling
Again, and again, and again, and again

Are you blind? are you cold? how can you say

You don't have an opinion
And that you'll give me a reason
That there is nothing left worth believing
In this world that we're living in

(Oh) well I have an opinion
Oh that there is always a reason
And their lies aren't worth believing
We have to show we're not giving in (no)

The wicked can't disguise their motives anyway
It's the ultimate crime when we look the other way
And sit compliant while the devils keep stalling
Again, and again, and again, and again

You cannot justify your perfect apathy
Cast aside your indifference
Throw it away and hear the voices of innocents calling
Again, and again, and again, and again

Are you blind? don't you know? how can you say

You don't have an opinion
And that you'll give me a reason
That there is nothing left worth believing
In this world that we're living in
(Oh) well I have an opinion
Oh that there is always a reason
And their lies aren't worth believing
We have to show we're not giving in (no)

Oh you've got to fight for it
Don't let the villainous ones decide
How we define ourselves
And you profess to know
That ignorance is bliss
Now do you want to let them decide
Whether we're alive or dead

You don't have an opinion
And that you'll give me a reason
That there is nothing left worth believing
In this world that we're living in

Saw myself a goin', down to war in June.
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune.

Wrote a song for truth.
Wrote a song For everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you. 

Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail.

If you see the answer, now's the time to say.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Con buenas chiquitas y muy buenas bebidas

Se ve que le gustan las buenas cosas
Su novia es una güera que esta re-sabrosa
Cantante de un bar que el visita a diario
Donde solo se reúne con altos funcionarios

Tan acostumbrado a lo que vivimos
En esta miseria ya estamos jodidos
Ya no hay vuelta de hoja, todo esta escrito
Tendrás que largarte por rumbo distinto

No lo tires en la calle porque contamina mina

The cuate was crazy valedores were down
He'd be at all the parties with the flashy clothes
He'd get a little drunk and powder up his nose
He'd be back stage at all the shows
He'd start to mouth off to show off to all the hoes

To steppin' people like it's going out of style
Shooting and snorting and smoking and in denial
You asking me ""man are you mad at me?""
I tell you ""es la droga man, it has to be""
Your'all fucked up, and it's sad to see

Que vayas a la tienda por un bote de pintura
Consigas un mango, el mango de un hacha
Y luego te la ensartes en la cucaracha
Si no te es suficiente y no te prendió la mecha,
Sigues caliente y no quedaste satisfecha

Ponle vaselina y metetelo en el fundillo
Si ya se te acabo toda la vaselina

The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;

Feel like I'm slipping down walls,
And every line,
I ever get a hold,
It seems to break.

Ca-call you up,
I can tell you just how much,
No, no maybe I'll just get drunk,
And it will all make sense.

I convince my friends that you were right,
I can promise you my heart don't cry,

And I've just arrived in camp
I've come to wear the uniform
And join the martial tramp

And I want to do my duty
But one thing I do implore
You must give me lessons, sergeant
For I've never killed before

To do my job obediently
Is all that I desire
To learn my weapon thoroughly
And how to aim and fire

To learn to kill the enemy
And then to slaughter more
Oh, I'll need instruction, sergeant
For I've never killed before

Now, there are rumors in the camp
About our enemy
They say that when you see him
He looks just like you and me

But you deny it, sergeant
And you are a man of war
So you must give me lessons
For I've never killed before

Now, there are several lessons
That I haven't mastered yet
I haven't got the hang of
How to use the bayonet

If he doesn't die at once
Am I to stick him with it more?
Oh, I hope you will be patient
For I've never killed before

And the hand grenade is somethin'
That I just don't understand
You've got to throw it quickly
Or you're apt to lose your hand

Does it blow a man to pieces
With it's wicked, muffled roar?
Oh, I've got so much to learn
Because I've never killed before

Well, I want to thank you, sergeant
For the help you've been to me
You've taught me how to kill
And to hate the enemy

And I know that I'll be ready
When they march me off to war
And I know that it won't matter
That I've never killed before

I've ridden a time or two in a silver plane

While great armies assemble

To shame the sun

They move like gods
They do resemble
All bow their necks
To iron feet when princes meet

When castles rise
The poor little men must build them
To charm the skies

They throw up the turrets
Where the great lords will them
They dig the dungeons
From the earth

And their brothers
Wives and children fill them
All those below cast down
Their eyes when castles rise

His praises sing
And grant that we may deserve him

The poor little men must fight them
They must do more

They hold out their necks
For great lord's swords to bite them

Through their ranks

In the hopes some warrior king
Might knight them
It's what the poor little men are for
When kings make war

Hide your cattle in the woods, Francois
The lord is looking your way
Hide your women and your goods, Francois

Hide if you can, poor little man

Tom Paxton,"With a dark and rolling sea
Between my love and me
I keep walking through this cold hard town
While I wait for better days
I could use a place to stay
Or a floor where I could lay my blanket down
If I could beg, steal, or borrow
A ticket on some boat or plane
I'd be leaving London tomorrow
To fly to my young love again
Up at dawn to change my shirt
And to wash away the dirt
Then it's over to American Express
Not one letter did I find
No, she didn't send one line
Though I know she had my forwarding address
Last night the Troubadour
Was so full they barred the door
And I sang a song she knows quite well
But it wouldn't take too long
To make up another song
For a lonesome and a last farewell",Leaving London,1988

Outward bound, it has no crew but me and you
All alone when just a minute ago the shore was filled with people
With people that we knew

Outward bound upon a journey without ending
Outward bound, uncharted waters beneath our bow
Far behind, the green familiar shore is fading into time
And time has left us now

So farewell, adieu, so long, vaya con Dios
May they find whatever they are looking for
Remember when the wine was better than ever again
We could not ask, we could not ask for more

Outward bound upon a crooked lonesome trail
Things we learn, we'll just be satisfied in knowing
And we'll tell it to our kids as a fairy tale

It was in the town of Shawnee
It was Saturday afternoon

As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain and the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed he laid that deputy down

How this outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes

That come to beg a meal
And underneath his napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill

It was on a Christmas Day
There was a whole carload of groceries
With a letter that did say

""Well, you say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief""

To memorizing politics of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow

Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

What would I give to start all over again
To clean up my mistakes

Stand in the moonlight, stand under heaven
Wait for an answer, hold out forever
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

What would I give to start all over again
To clean up my mistakes

Tom Petty,"It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
She's an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector

Broken skyline, which way to love land
Which way to something better
Which way to forgiveness
Which way do I go

It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Sometime later, getting the words wrong
Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenalin
Like breakin' up a dogfight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time
I'm losing my mind

It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going",Time to Move On,1994

Who compares with you

I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold

Can I help it if I still dream time to time

It's good to be king and have your own way
Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day
And when your bulldog barks and your canary sings
You're out there with winners, it's good to be king

Yeah I'll be king when dogs get wings
Can I help it if I still dream time to time

Tom Petty,"If you reach back in your memory
A little bell might ring
About a time that once existed 
When money wasn't king
If you stretch your imagination 
I'll tell you all a tale
About a time when everything
Wasn't up for sale

There was this cat named Johnny
Who loved to play and sing 
When money wasn't king

We'd all get so excited
When John would give a show 
We'd raise the cash between us
And down the road we'd go
To hear him play that music 
It spoke right to my soul 
Every verse a diamond
And every chorus gold
The sound was my salvation
It was only everything
Before money became king

Well I ain't sure how it happened
And I don't know exactly when
But everything got bigger
And the rules began to bend
And they taught the people 
How to get their hair to shine
And how sweet life can be 
If you keep a tight behind
And they raised the cost of living
And could we have known
They'd doubled the price of tickets
To go see Johnny's show

So we hocked all our possessions
And we sold a little dope
And went off to rock and roll

We arrived there early
In time to see rehearsal 
And John came out and lip-synched
His new lite beer commercial
And as the crowd arrived
As far as I could see
The faces were all different
There was no one there like me

They sat in golden circles
And waiters served them wine
And they talked through all the music
And to John paid little mind
And way up in the nosebleeds 
We watched him on the screen
They'd hung between the billboards
So cheaper seats could see

Johnny rocked that golden circle 
And all those VIP's
And that music that had freed us
Became a tired routine
And I saw his face in close-up
Trying to give it all he had
And sometimes his eyes betrayed him
You could see that he was sad
And I tried to rock on with him
But I slowly became bored
Could that man on stage With everything
Somehow needed more?

There was no use in pretending
No magic left to hear
All the music gave me 
Was a craving for lite beer
As I walked out of the arena
My ears began to ring
And money became king",Money Becomes King,2003
Tom Petty,"You got a different kinda look in your eye
Somethin' about you that I don't recognize
These things are talked about in quiet tones
I never saw a person so all alone

Some mama's cryin'
Some daddy's sad
When a kid goes bad
Makes you wonder
What made him mad
When a kid goes bad
When a kid goes bad

You built for innocence, you built for joy
Suddenly evil's all that you enjoy
But if you shoot at everyone you see
Well, you can't be my friend 'cause you might shoot at me

Some mama's cryin'
Some daddy's sad
When a kid goes bad
Make you wonder
What made him mad
When a kid goes bad
When a kid goes bad

Somewhere along the way did we let you down?
Did you cry out for help and none was around?
Don't try to tell me that you don't know the score
Are you so shut down you can't feel anymore?

Some daddy's sad

Tom Petty,"I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me
At anytime
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open

Within me there's a prison
Surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon
With its wall of stone
I know running's not the answer
Though, running's been my nature

Had some fear to get around

Can't sell your soul for piece of mind

Took a long time... to get back here

Struggle to see past my nose 
Always had more dogs than bones 
I could never wear those clothes

You won and you also lost 
Told us you were satisfied

Refusing to be crowned

Past statues that atone for my sins

In the still of the night
How still my love

Standing in the doorway
Watching out to sea
Calling out to me
You go your way
Go on go on
But you don't forget me
Oh no you don't forget me
Oh no my lonely one
You're doing all you can for me

Feels good sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And another voice comes through the door

I am dealing with a man
When away from me stays deep inside my heart
And he says if anyone falls in love
It will be one of us

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls 

And I heard someone say
As my eyes turned away
He said I have loved many women
I have many times run away

Ooh I have never known the words
Well I have tried to be true
Well I have never known what to say
How to say seen anything today
Never seen anything like you

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls

Tom Petty,"Is love so fragile
And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words
Impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see

I have my own life and I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever face to face
My city your mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

Lovers forever face to face
My city your mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

And the heart skips a beat
So you're lonely
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Can you love me only

Look at me, for a very long time
Long enough to know
Love is a word - I've been trying to find
Words don't matter
They don't matter at all

Maybe it's only a dream
I don't want to feel that
Well it's one more link - in the chain
I don't believe that

So you're still lonely
You say that it's been forever
Maybe you never knew me
Maybe you thought that
I'd never change but
You know I'm changing
You're wrong

And it's been like dying
No love's that hard to find 
And I'm tired of 
I'm tired of trying
Outside the rain
And the heart skips a beat
So you're lonely

Look in my eyes
Touch my face
Baby, there's no one
That can take my place

Look in my eyes, touch my face
Baby there's no one that
Can ever replace that heartache
Take away that heartache

If you find it
You have won the game

Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did
He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did
They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
A jeep to drive, blood to spill
They said ""Congratulations, you got what it takes""
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did
He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool
They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Could've been an accountant or a tennis star
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own
They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him,
That's what they did
Well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about
He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
That's the way I remember her best.

Tom Petty,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son
And where have you been, my darling young one
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son
And what did you see, my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'

The smile on her lips
The thrill an' the touch

A heaven of bliss
In each caress
In each tender kiss

You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away

Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown

I'll remember you

I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail

One time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you.

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair.

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piny wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you.",I'll Remember You,2016
Tom Petty,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn that he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be
One more person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only",It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding),2016

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about

He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He's on some other shore, he didn't want to live anymore.

They say he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools

Of the Plaza all-adult

It wasn't no way to live

Said, ""Send me up a drink""

Still have some wine""

Found the still made bed
All except the pillows that lay stacked
Up at the head

Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers,"If you reach back in your memory
A little bell might ring
About a time that once existed 
When money wasn't king
If you stretch your imagination 
I'll tell you all a tale
About a time when everything
Wasn't up for sale

There was this cat named Johnny
Who loved to play and sing 
When money wasn't king

We'd all get so excited
When John would give a show 
We'd raise the cash between us
And down the road we'd go
To hear him play that music 
It spoke right to my soul 
Every verse a diamond
And every chorus gold
The sound was my salvation
It was only everything
Before money became king

Well I ain't sure how it happened
And I don't know exactly when
But everything got bigger
And the rules began to bend
And they taught the people 
How to get their hair to shine
And how sweet life can be 
If you keep a tight behind
And they raised the cost of living
And could we have known
They'd doubled the price of tickets
To go see Johnny's show

So we hocked all our possessions
And we sold a little dope
And went off to rock and roll

We arrived there early
In time to see rehearsal 
And John came out and lip-synched
His new lite beer commercial
And as the crowd arrived
As far as I could see
The faces were all different
There was no one there like me

They sat in golden circles
And waiters served them wine
And they talked through all the music
And to John paid little mind
And way up in the nosebleeds 
We watched him on the screen
They'd hung between the billboards
So cheaper seats could see

Johnny rocked that golden circle 
And all those VIP's
And that music that had freed us
Became a tired routine
And I saw his face in close-up
Trying to give it all he had
And sometimes his eyes betrayed him
You could see that he was sad
And I tried to rock on with him
But I slowly became bored
Could that man on stage With everything
Somehow needed more?

There was no use in pretending
No magic left to hear
All the music gave me 
Was a craving for lite beer
As I walked out of the arena
My ears began to ring
And money became king",Money Becomes King,2002

A little bell might ring
About a time that once existed 
When money wasn't king
If you stretch your imagination 
I'll tell you all a tale
About a time when everything
Wasn't up for sale

There was this cat named Johnny
Who loved to play and sing 
When money wasn't king

We'd all get so excited
When John would give a show 
We'd raise the cash between us
And down the road we'd go
To hear him play that music 
It spoke right to my soul 
Every verse a diamond
And every chorus gold
The sound was my salvation
It was only everything
Before money became king

And I don't know exactly when
But everything got bigger
And the rules began to bend
And they taught the people 
How to get their hair to shine
And how sweet life can be 
If you keep a tight behind
And they raised the cost of living
And could we have known
They'd doubled the price of tickets
To go see Johnny's show

So we hocked all our possessions
And we sold a little dope
And went off to rock and roll

We arrived there early
In time to see rehearsal 
And John came out and lip-synched
His new lite beer commercial
And as the crowd arrived
As far as I could see
The faces were all different
There was no one there like me

They sat in golden circles
And waiters served them wine
And they talked through all the music
And to John paid little mind
And way up in the nosebleeds 
We watched him on the screen
They'd hung between the billboards
So cheaper seats could see

Johnny rocked that golden circle 
And all those VIP's
And that music that had freed us
Became a tired routine
And I saw his face in close-up
Trying to give it all he had
And sometimes his eyes betrayed him
You could see that he was sad
And I tried to rock on with him
But I slowly became bored
Could that man on stage With everything
Somehow needed more?

There was no use in pretending
No magic left to hear

Do you love me
Just like I love you

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

You say we're giving you a real hard time
You boys are really breaking my heart
Spurs beat Arsenal, what a game

Intercity took the trains
And really took the place apart
That was the year Nan Harris died
And Charlie Jones committed suicide
The world we knew busted open wide

I'd been working on and off
A pint of beer was still ten bob
My brand new Bonneville got ripped off
I more or less give up trying
They stopped the Social in the spring
And quite a few communists got run in
And National Service come back in
In the winter of '79
When Marco's caff went up in flames
The Vambo boys took the blame
The SAS come and took our names

It was us poor bastards took the chop
When the tubes gone up and the buses stopped
The top people still come out on top
The government never resigned
The Carib Club got petrol bombed
The National Front was getting awful strong

And coloured kids was getting crucified

Tom Robinson,"The British Police are the best in the world
I don't believe one of these stories I've heard
'Bout them raiding our pubs for no reason at all
Lining the customers up by the wall
Picking out people and knocking them down
Resisting arrest as they're kicked on the ground
Searching their houses and calling them queer
I don't believe that sort of thing happens here

Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way

Pictures of naked young women are fun
In Titbits and Playboy, page three of The Sun
There's no nudes in xxx News our one magazine
But they still find excuses to call it obscene
Read how disgusting we are in the press
Telegraphs, people and Sunday Express
Molesters of children, corruptors of youth
It's there in the paper, it must be the truth

Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way

Don't try to kid us that if you're discreet
You're perfectly safe as you walk down the street
You don't have to mince or make bitchy remarks
To get beaten unconscious and left in the dark
I had a friend who was gentle and short
He was lonely one evening and went for a walk
Queerbashers caught him and kicked in his teeth
He was only hospitalised for a week

Sing if you're glad to be gay
Sing if you're happy that way

So sit back and watch as they close all our clubs
Arrest us for meeting and raid all our pubs
Make sure your boyfriend's at least 21
So only your friends and your brothers get done
Lie to your workmates, lie to your folks
Put down the queens and tell anti-queer jokes

'Cause nobody I know has got a brother like him
As kids we could never be parted
The neighbours all knew us as the terrible twins
At school some kids were always looking for a fight
But Martin never wanted a fuss
Bigmouth Brown thought he'd push him around
Being three years older than us
So I smashed him in the mush with the cloakroom stool
I got six of the best and suspended from school

But it was worth it with a brother like Martin
It was worth it with a brother like him

We used to nick motors for a joyride
Till we rammed a Black Maria in this XJ6
To give Martin time to get clear
I tried to punch a few policemen before I got nicked
I got Borstal for taking and driving away
And beating up the boys in blue
But Martin never missed a single visiting day
He hitched from Clapham to Crewe
With all me racing mags and the little bits of news
Smuggling in ciggies and a little bit of booze

No-one ever had a brother like Martin
No-one ever had a brother like him

People get the wrong impression with Martin
I know he doesn't mix much but he's no snob
The weekend I got out of remand home
He'd got Uncle Ruby to find me this job
And back at my Nan's he'd repainted my room
And bought me a brand new carpet
There was all me old records and books on a shelf
And a secondhand telly from the market

When I heard the distant urging of the brine
Though I cried at night as I tried to fight the emotion
That bitter cup of tears was truly mine

But when I came to taste the spray on the waterfront
I lost my fear and shrugged away my shame
And I stowed away on a trans-atlantic freighter
With the tempest raging in my every vein

A man may spend his life afloat, a man may live ashore
I'll cast away and take my chance at sea

There were stormy days and roaring nights a-plenty
In the salty fellowship of boys and men
They were tough and true, they were glassy eyed and reckless
With a blazing thirst, I drank and drank again

We crossed the line, explored the depths of danger
Exceeding every fantasy and dream
No landsman with his stifling horizons
Could ever guess the wonders we had seen

A man may spend his life afloat, a man may live ashore
I'll cast away and take my chance at sea
I've braved the waves in an open boat and I know these waters well
I'll man your lifeboat any time you need

Way, castaway from the restless aching
Way, castaway, gonna leave it all behind
Way, far away where the waves are breaking
Way, far away where the ocean meets the sky

Well a ship must tack and a man must follow his compass
On an unknown shore I foundered in the sand
Met a salty girl with a sailor's gait and her eyes were a greeny blue
And she knew the ropes like the back of her sunburned hand

We danced a hornpipe on the beach to the sound of the seething swell
We drank and sank exhausted on the strand
Till I slipped my anchor, quit my ship and became a castaway
To savor the embrace of her native land

A man may spend his life afloat, a man may live ashore
A man may marry and still put out to sea

Don't try to tell me you'd escape the curse

Than begging on the cold cold ground

And it won't be long
You think you know the future
But you're so, so wrong

You can lean on me
But your life's your own
Your own responsibility

You sit there wasted
And you drink all day
You cruise the kennels
And go all the way

Please, please, please
Don't disrespect yourself

Well the crunch is coming
You abuse your brain
Your God given body
And your own good name

Take the risk of winning
Stand up, be strong
To those brutal losers
You gotta prove them wrong

You've been mistreated
And you've been abused
But that's all over
If you only choose, I said

Wanna hold your shoulder

Tom Robinson,"There were times in my life
I avoided the voice of my reason
When respect for myself
Was the search for a hole in the wall

When I hated my face and
Evaded my gaze in the mirror
Been a fool to myself but
I ain't gonna do it no more

I believed all the crap that
Fanatics were happy to parrot
And their world of uncomfortable
Certainties made me secure

I conformed and performed
All their torturous mental contortions
Been a fool to myself but
I ain't gonna do it no more

Living each day in a
Permanent haze of frustration
Too eager to please and
Too scared to say boo to a hen

Lying awake going over
Each humiliation
I've been kicking myself
Again and again and again

I've tried to be nice all the time
And control my emotions
I've pretended I wanna make love
When I'm ready for war

And I've planned every move
And manoeuvre in human relations
Been a fool to myself but
I ain't gonna do it no more

I'm sick to the gills of appeasing the creeps who abuse me
All the sorrys, I've muttered to others for nothing at all
Of accepting the verdict of vermin who lie and accuse me

Been a fool to myself but
I ain't gonna do it no more
Been a fool to myself but
I ain't gonna do it no more

You were tasty, you were tempting and I knew you were the one for me
I swallowed and I followed 'cause I knew you were the one for me

Telegraphed a message that was weird and wild
You were beefy and delicious and I knew you were the one for me

Hot Dog, so tender too
Hot Dog, you know it's true
I saw you in the morning and I knew you were the one for me

It was dangerous and crazy but I knew you were the one for me

Crawl back in the dead of the night

Are smoking and drinking and both of us thinking

About to crash out for the night
If we became closer well no one would know
So roll over and switch out the light

To bite any pieces of me that they liked
They beat me and hurt me till I ran away

They say there's been a slight mistake
But while they write reports,we've heard it all before
Let's get him out before it's all too late

A man who swears he's not to blame
Ten long years he's been there shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed

Any day now, any day now I shall be released",I Shall Be Released,1997

Tom Rozum,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift,1999

Please ride her on home

Get down on your knees and pray

You're gonna need
Your loving daddy's help someday

For treating me this way

Look good going down?
Well, believe me, don't that sun
Look good going down?

Get along with you

I'm gonna quit my crying

But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning
Wasn't that a mighty storm
It blew all the people away.

The rain it was a falling and the thunder began to roll
The lightning flashed like Hell-fire and the wind began to blow

The trees fell on the island and the houses gave away
Some they strived and drownded others died every way.

The trains at the station were loaded with the people all leaving town
But the trestle gave way with the water and the trains they went on down
Old death the cruel master when the winds began to blow
Rode in on a team of horses and cried death won't you let me go.

The flood it took my mother it took my brother too
I thought I heard my father cry as I watched my mother go
Old death your hands are clammy when you've got them on my knee
You come and took my mother won't you come back after me?

And I get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown

And not another man in town my darling's heart could win

And bully winds did rub their face down in the snow

I'll lock the vagrant winter out I'll bolt my wandering in

And have her stay for just another month or so

And closing his eyes as the doggies retire

Baby, please don't go, down to New Orleans
You know I love you so

Tom Rush,"Way up north by the ice bound ocean
I was born I was born
Way up north in the Merrimack county
That's my home that's my home

When I was younger and in my schooling
I walked the mountains made of stone
The distance sang about tomorrow
And I did wish I was grown and gone

Well as I grew indeed I rambled
Out along the open road
There I learned the rainbow circle
It's truly said that's a sign of storm

Now I'm old my dreams they wander
Far away in yesterday
I'm going home to the Merrimack county
And find the grass that hides my grave

So let the birds fly down the valley
Let the storms roam on the sea
I was born to the rainbow circle
Stoney mountain that's home to me
",Merrimac County,1997
Tom Rush,"I know your leavin's too long, overdue
For far too long
I've had nothin' new to show to you
Goodbye dry eyes
I watched your plane
Fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange
To walk away, alone
No regrets
No tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say, 'goodbye' again
The hours that were yours
Echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share
I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinkin' you were gone
Felt so strange
To lie awake alone
No regrets
No tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say 'goodbye', again
Our friends have tried
To turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place
Can't keep the ghosts away
Just beyond the darkest hour
Just behind the dawn
Still feels so strange
To lead my life alone
I've no regrets
No tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say, 'goodbye', again.",No Regrets [Ace Radio Edit],1998
Tom Rush,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans,2003
Tom Rush,"Come on, baby, won't you dance with me,
Come on, mamma, can't you see,
We can make our troubles fly away.
Come on, baby, let's don't fight,
Come on, mamma, let's fly tonight,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.

Now, I'm so sorry I made you cry,
I can be a real jerk sometimes,
But you know that I know that you know I love you so.
So come on, baby, let's shine them shoes,
Come on, mamma, let's lose the blues,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.

Won't you listen to the way the guitar plays,
Listen to the way that the bass part lays,
Down in the middle of the tune and the rhythm so strong.
Boom be' boom goes the big bass drum,
Piano man's going to take his turn,
Look out, baby! The Singer's going to sing his song.

He says, ""Come on, baby, won't you dance with me,
Come on, mamma, can't you see,
We can make our troubles fly away.
Come on, baby, let's don't fight,
Come on, mamma, let's fly tonight,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.""

Sugar pie, you sure fly high,
Make me feel like the Fourth of July,
Bump my head right up against the moon.
Hey diddle diddle, get out in the middle,
Jump and wiggle to the jiggle of the fiddle,
Don't stop to think about it or you'll realize real soon:

This song don't mean a thing,
But it sure is fun to sing,
It's a silly little diddle,
I was hoping it would make you smile.
Ain't got a lot to say,
But it's kinda fun to play, 
If it gets you dancing, well the diddle
It'll be worthwhile.

So, Come on, baby, won't you dance with me,
Come on, mamma, can't you see,
We can make our troubles fly away.
Come on, baby, let's don't fight,
Come on, mamma, let's fly tonight,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.

I said, come on, mamma, hitch up your socks,
Come on, baby, show 'em what you got,
We can make our troubles fly away.
Oh, mamma, let's shine them shoes,
Come on, baby, let's lose the blues,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.",Silly Little Diddle,2003
Tom Rush,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots,2003
Tom Rush,"I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky",Will the Circle Be Unbroken,2003
Tom Rush,"Give me the beat, boys
Give me the beat, boys

Day after day, I'm more confused
But I look for the light through the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feeling the strain, ain't it a shame?

Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

I'm beginning to think that I'm wasting time
And I don't understand the things I do
Yeah, the world outside looks so unkind
Now it's up to you to carry me through

Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

And when my mind is free
You know, the melody can move me
And when I'm feeling blue
The guitar's coming through to soothe me, yeah

Thanks for the joy you've given me
I want you to know that I believe in the song
The rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along, you're making me strong

Give me the beat, boys
Give me the beat, boys, come on

Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat, boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys and free my soul

Tom Rush,"I'm sorry to be calling so late,
But you could always chase my blues away.
I could find a new love,
That wouldn't be enough.
Tonight, I need someone who,
Who knows me better than I do.
I need just, just one more night of us.

What an old lover knows takes time to learn,
That kind of trust takes time to earn.
Tonight I need someone who knows,
What only an old lover knows.

I don't like all this sleeping alone,
And how I miss those nights of holding on.
Going out of my head,
I never will forget.
'Cause you know all the things I love, 
And you know just how to touch.
You know I, I need that kind of love again.

What an old lover knows takes time to learn,
That kind of trust takes time to earn.
Tonight I need someone who knows,
What only an old lover knows.

Tom Rush,"Amazing grace 
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost 
But now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught 
My heart to fear
And grace my Fears relieved
How precious did
That grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace hath brought 
Us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

When we've been there 
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We'll have no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace 
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost 
But now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see",Amazing Grace,2012
