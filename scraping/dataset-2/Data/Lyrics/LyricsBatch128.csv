Deborah Cox,"I walk through these halls but nothing feels the same
Where we once made our lives, it's now so empty
The same paint is on the walls
The same songs, I use to sing alone
We'd run through the night but now it's so cold (so cold)

Oh, this house is not a home
'Cause love don't live here anymore (since you been gone)
I never felt this all alone since you went away
'Cause this house is not a home (love don't live here)
Why don't it feel like it felt before?
I know you're never coming back
This time is it over? (over)

I look in the mirror and you're still standing there
It's just an illusion of what use to be
So I lay in the bed we shared
Where we made love a million times I swear
Can't face the truth that you moved on, you're gone

Oh, this house is not a home
'Cause love don't live here anymore (since you been gone)
I never felt this all alone since you went away
'Cause this house is not a home (love don't live here no more)
Why don't it feel like it felt before?
I know you're never coming back
This time is it over? (over)

[Bridge]
In these rooms we were together
But now were so far apart
We should of tried to make it better
But then you went and left and torn up my heart

When you left
No no no

(Love don't live here)
(Since you been gone)
(It's so lonely)
(When you coming home?)
(Love don't live here)

Love don't live here anymore
(Since you been gone)
Since you went away baby why didn't you stay?
I'm alone now, it's so lonely baby
Since you went away
It's not the same
Is it over? Is it over?
Am I right? Am I right? Am I right?",House Is Not a Home [Tony Moran\Warren Rigg],2006
Deborah Cox,"The windows of the world are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew?
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue?
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to?
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarrel often ends where some have to die
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry?
Let the sun shine through",The Windows of the World,2006

Deborah Cox,"You got what it takes baby
Woo, come and sing with me

Well, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
Ooh baby, you've got what it takes, yeah

You know it takes a lot of kissin' to make a romance sweet
Mmm, it takes a whole lot of lovin' to make my life complete
And it takes a whole lot of man, yes, it does to knock me off my feet
Oh, oh baby, see you've got what it takes, yes, you do

And I say, mmm, oh, ooh
You know you've got just what it takes

And it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody really special to make me say, I do
Oh and baby, you've got what it takes, yes, you do

Ah, mmm, ah, mmm
See you know you've got just what it takes

'Cause it takes more than an effort to stay away from you

Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies

Singing a song

Shining so bright
Never saw things
Going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by

Deborah Cox,"Poor man take a trip in my rocket ship
We'll have a lovely afternoon
Kiss the world good-bye and away we'll fly
Our destination moon

We'll travel fast as a light to win, out of sight
The turf will be like a toy balloon
What a feel you'll get riding on my jet
A destination moon

Oh we'll go up, up, up, up
Straight to the moon, we two
High in the starry blue
I'll be out of this world with you

So when we steal in my space mobile

Deborah Cox,"I don't hurt anymore, all my
Teardrops are dried
No more walkin' the floor with
That burnin' inside
Just to think it could be,
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free, no, I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny, I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now I find you're out of my mind
And I can't believe that it's true

I've forgotten somehow
That I cared so before
Yes, it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore

Deborah Cox,"On the day I was born, said my father, said he
""I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye""
'Tis wine for your lips and a song for your heart
To sing it whenever the world falls apart

Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the streams
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream

So I bundled my heart and I roam the world free
To the east with a lark, to the west with the sea
And I searched all the earth and I scanned all the skies
And I found it at last in my own true love's eyes

Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the streams
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream

Follow the fellow, follow the fellow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream",Look to the Rainbow,2007
Deborah Cox,"Mainly you have fire on my mind
More than you ought to be
Mainly I find, you're on my mind
More than you ought to be

Thoughts of you should bring me joy
But then you only bring misery

Well, well, I tried to act gay seemed to have fun
But I'm finding a bottle that can't be one
'Cause you're on my mind more than you ought to be

Thoughts of you should bring me joy
But then you only bring misery

Now beyond happiness you bring, really isn't fair
But I payin' a heaven, heaven above
someday you'll have to care
And keep me on your mind more than I ought to be

But I hope my thoughts bring you joy
And not a whole lot of misery, oh
Not a whole lot of misery, oh",Misery,2007
Deborah Cox,"The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun without just like a dying ember
In September in the rain

To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain

To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to sing a sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September

Deborah Cox,"They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said, some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now, laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
And yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Don't stop till I tell you when
Now daddy, squeeze me and kiss me some more

Oh daddy, don't make your sweet mama cry
Just pick me up on your knee and I just get
So you know, oh when you squeeze me

Oh daddy, squeeze me and squeeze me again
Don't stop till I tell you when
Now daddy, squeeze me and kiss me some more

Deborah Cox,"This bitter earth
Well, what fruit it bears
What good is love
That no one shares

And if my life is like the dust
Mmm, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I
Heaven only knows

Lord, this bitter earth
Yes, can be so cold
Today you're young
Too soon you're old

But while a voice within me cries
I know heaven will answer my call

Ooh, may not be so bitter after all

Twenty-four little hours,
Brought the sun and the flowers,
Where their used to be rain.

Today I?m a part of you dear,
My lonley nights are through dear,
Since you said ""you are mine"".

Deborah Cox,"Out of sight, out of mind
So the story goes
You forgot I exist
My broken heart knows

When out of sight then it's out of mind
Especially when you found somebody new
But I can't change my love
Umm umm, the way that you do

I sit around and wonder
About your new love affair
That's what you call lookin' back
I should forget to remember
And remember not to care

I'd forget if I could
But my heart is blind
You are gone out of sight
But you're lingering in my mind

Out of sight but not out of my mind

",Out of Sight Out of Mind [*],2007
Deborah Cox,"I can't believe that a year has passed 
It seems like yesterday in September 

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again 
He held me there in my time of need 
My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory 

[Chorus]
The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September

And I almost lost my mind
I remember the things we did
I can't believe it's a waste of time
And sometimes I want to cry
And sometimes I want to die

Why can't my heart just lie

The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

Never wanna go back in time
Not much glory
In that story but it's mine so I'm
Loving who I am today
The past has past away
Finally I
Have forgiven me

I hold a memory of myself
So young and foolish and not knowing
Careless decisions that I made
I wish somebody would have told me
But a new day is here
It's time that I embrace it
Can't wait another day
Right now I gotta face it

[Chorus]

The mirror on the wall
It makes me see today
That I'm, I'm not that foolish girl
Time has brought a change
A transformation
The old into the new
When I let go of me
And held on to you

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again

Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try

Deborah Shulman,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Debout sur le Zinc,"Tous ces anges déchus
Qui éparpillent ici
Une partie de leur vie
Qu’ils n’ont jamais vécue
Je les revois encore
S’accrocher au comptoir
D’un futur dérisoire
Que le présent dévore
Et la nuit les emmène
Où ils n’iront jamais
Les mensonges sont si vrais
Quand on s’en donne la peine
Les verres à moitié pleins
N’effaceront pas le vide
De ces regards humides
Perdus dans le lointain
De ces ombres en sursis
Bouffées par l’existence
Il nous reste le silence
D’un navire englouti
Et dans leur portefeuille
Traîne une photo d’avant
Quand ils étaient vivants
Quand ils disaient « je t’aime »
Quand vient le dernier verre
Ils posent résignés
Un vieux billet froissé
A côté de leur bière
Sans un mot ils s’en vont
Comme ils étaient venus

Ces forçats du canon
Alors ils disparaissent

À prolonger l’ivresse",Dans la nuit avancée,2017

Is letting go

Then set them free
If they come back again

And love the way love's supposed to be
Never with hurt or pain
And never with something else to gain
And isn't it strange it seems so clear
That you have nothing here to fear
But somehow the morning light
Fades all the things you see at night

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

Once you're there
You'll know that you're inside
You can't turn back
When you open your eyes

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

and let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce
they want some reggae, like some flex
time to have sex
and it's all night, so turn off the light
and let's get high as a kite
and have safe sex

[Chorus]

somebody say sex (sex)
say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)

but for real, when you're havin' sex
no matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
to all of the cons out there sexin'
stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
cause aids is real and something to believe
or not make-believe and fake like hair weave
a death wish like Charles Bronson
and if you don't believe me then ask Magic Johnson
about the sex

[Chorus]",Safe Sex,1993
Debra Killings,"Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

If ya thirsty I could possibly slide down your throat
If you work may let's say we skip the foreplay
Picture me kicking in the doorway to set off the storey
Negligee hot tip of the knockers stay brick like rocks

Figure if you drop ice here I don't stop
'cause it's twice as nice when it's frosted up
Sweetness like this could never cost enough
With a so, so twist, try this stuff

Mouth watering love succulent to all taste buds
Must of been us you was dreaming of the crush
I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the lust
Then jiggle the lemons a little so they feel to touch

Cream to us say nothing to us scared
Premium pink stuff and swing with us sweetened it up
To it make you wanna say, ""Ooh its cool""

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

I'm weighed in at one tree five a big gulp size
Seven eleven can't satisfy your appetite all night
JD and I planned it to be dickable so it's alright
You can come and escapade in my escalade

Lay me flat on my back and slurp away
I get action in a Bentley with no brains
Just pure satisfaction cracking with no cain
I came for the thrill of it I ain't looking for real love
Just the feel of it

After just one taste you still bugging
Da black cat make you wanna handle business
Until the pleasure principle kick it

If you hit this I'll make you tell your wife and your mistress
To leave town 'cause they been evicted
Hit up a record store pick up Brat and get addicted

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

A thirst quenching mouth watering concoction
Your only option drink to ya pink why stop it
One think its refreshing isn't it the best when you sipping it
Heaven sake honey buns built for dipping in

Money come quicker than a two minute brother
That concentrate on stiffin' when he love it
Stick when too dry so keep stirring
It still be the sweet even if it turn syrup

Hurry up and get a cup full cop fills and get' cha cap peeled back
Rash a little rat first smash went classic
Even with my homies help on the west you wack
Sincerely Brat where my girls at

We stick together in the rain
Batches of pink lemonade bringing da pain
Any day and every minute make you wanna get up in it
'cause it's just that cool

Cool, refreshing cool

Debroy Somers,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay. 
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay.
Just to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons at their play. 

For the breezes blowin' o'er the sea from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties
Speak a language that the strangers do not know. 

Yet the stangers came and tried to teach us their way.
They scorned us just for bein' what we are.
But they might as well go chasing after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star. 

And if there's is going to be a life hereafter,
And somehow I am sure there's going to be,
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.

Decca Mixed Chorus,"The story of Shadrack, Meshach, and Abednego
There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the trombone""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol""
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the children of Israel would not bow down
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
I said, you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Well, they couldn't burn a hair on the head of
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Laughin' and talkin' while the fire jumpin' 'round
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Old Nebudchanezzer called, ""hey there!""
When he saw the power of the Lord
And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon

Oh, Abednego",Shadrack,2002

Decca Studio Orchestra,"Every time I hear that dear old wedding march
I feel rather glad I have a broken arch.
I have heard a lot of people talk
And I know that marriage is a long long walk.

To most people weddings mean romance
But I prefer a picnic or a dance.

Another bride,
Another groom, 
Another sunny honeymoon,
Another season,
Another reason
For making whoopee.

Another victim is by her side.
He's lost his reason cause it's the season 
For making whoopee.

Down through the countless ages
You'll find it everywhere.
Somebody makes good wages.
Somebody wants her share.

She calls him 'Toodles' and rolls her eyes.
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies.
What is it all for?
It's so he'll fall for making whoopee.

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear?
Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected so he's suspected
Of making whoopee.

She sits alone most every night.
He doesn't phone or even write.
He says he's busy.
But she says, ""Is he?""
He's making whoopee.

He doesn't make much money: 
Five thousand dollars per.
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""

Deceased,"Our mind manipulation was no strength for the deceased
The master plan defeasted by the laws of earth's beliefs
And in death's costume now I live a lonely, empty corpse
Existing matter left to wait infinity's demise
For all the greed my just reward
The reaper's prize the mask of death
It fits my face and grips my skull as exact as can be
A perfect mold symmetric cast forever locked to me
For all the greed my just reward
The reaper's prize the mask of death
A marching ghoul the sight of hell, hell!

This war was Armageddon the rising of the dead
As every breath of every life has vanished from the world
And here we stand the winning losers left to wander earth
The miles and miles of emptiness witnessed by no one
And as the story ends I'm still wishing for my dream
Of being dead, forgotten, no longer a machine!

There isn't pulse yet on I go somewhere in between
I cannot stop my time on earth or end my legacy
Thinking back to my past in truth I fell from grace
And for my sins I'm one of ""them"" and they are one of me
And as the story ends I'm still wishing for my dream
Of being dead, forgotten, no longer a machine!

For what mind created man and what did end his reign?
Just who created planet earth and who created me?
For I am only flesh and bone a seed of many seeds
A soulless victim on a chain a slave to what does lead
I'm hell's forever!

For the truth it stands before me, death is my destiny!""",Destiny,1997

Foreseeing into future fully aware of what has come
You see they predicted monsters from the ground to swallow man
Safely in their fortress they live as if there is life
There's no fear of the living dead
They know they'll live on in their ""new world""
There's telepathic scenes with crystal balls and tarot cards
A cult of fortune tellers with minds that see all mystery
They say that they've been waiting for my arrival to their world
It seems as though I'm gifted with the sight to see beyond
As they prepare their magic I prepare my mind
To break this hold that's hanging on to keep me from my kind
As we join hands and chant the chant the truth is now revealed
I feel their power I join their ranks a living breathing lord
And now I know there's a future hidden beyond this world
A new beginning a higher plain very few shall see
By invitation I've been accepted to build and start again
I've learned these monsters are really saints cleansing all the earth
The undead have their purpose to strengthen, rebuild the weak!
Within my mind I realize there's still life to see
As I vision it now I can understand the reasons for their acts
I can see our world I can see beyond
We're not afraid forever we are strong!
And now there are no worries for all our goals will be achieved
While the outside world awaits this sudden ""plague"" to fade and die
And as all time keeps moving bringing the end to a tired world
We just stand by ready for our crowning moment to come!
Now they're tearing at our walls and challenging our force
A mutiny of our monsters now at war with our lords
Destiny all destiny a monster for infinity
Destiny my destiny an eternity of death
How quickly we lose battle with creatures that don't die
From beyond the grave these new messiahs control what's left of life

Yo yo, we got Crackerjack from the Loot Pack 
About to see this shit off, a Crackerjack 
Set it off. I know we on the radio, yo Crackerjack 
Set it off 

Ya dumb dunce it goes once upon the rhyme, Jack is out 
To clench a fist and drop flows that gets papes like The Abyss 
All in this, freestyle's wild when I'm throwing this 
Non-bogus brothers shake the hip and toe and just 
Get involved, roll with the souled, make the head nod 
Look at the bash slash back I kick the abstract 
Make brothers say ""Damn, that rap's fat,"" recline that ass back 
A smack-back and slap from Wild Child with the ram shack 
I used to pick up the damn slack bed on the ramps back 
In the days, when Eric, was in the, honey phase 
Nowadays, turn in applications 
Rocking the Appalachians with the ladies with the sexy activations 
On the Black watch, I own a black watch, although I'm Black watch

Complicated for ya (yeah) 
I got the naps that break the picks 
Plus the props from the Licks 
Ha ha, Loot Pack's on the rise 
Saying, ""Licks licks licks boy, run your backside"" 
Yo, J-Rocc, Mad Lib, my man 
Just, get on the mic and please arise the jam 

I bust the animated suspension, vocabulary wack MC prevention 
My division is itching for the switch 
Pitching upon the West coast, the best brad and boast 
Braggadocios, ferocious emotional osmosis 
I skip like a stone when I lake over a break 
I rip microphones and I take over the fake crews 
I wish I could sing like Smokey do 
But I'm vocally locin' with the Loot Pack crew 
I'm Mad Lib, the bad kid, brothers try to do what I did 
Back in junior high, 'cause I'm fly with my 
Vocabulary tradition, total chaos rhythmatic 
Static, in fact they case erase so stay off 
Cause nobody knows how it goes with the flows 
And rows of hoes froze, chosen bust erosion on the lows when 
The ill speak, plus the licks knot thick 
Mad quick to rock ya lip, like hip-hop to grits 
But yo freak this, I come with uniqueness 
I'm like Pepe LePew yo, hoes are my weakness 
Back in high school you didn't think I could get nifty 
Now I'm on your magazine rack down at Thrifty 
Since eighty-three I been housing folks 
All the way from Orange Country out to Thousand Oaks 
It ain't another rapper in the country who can crunch me 
If you don't believe me, run up and try to punch me 
I flip the funk like Monk, Higgins when I'm digging 
I'm swigging on a Snapple 'cause my crew be wicked when we gig it 
I rock the mad vocab, when my toe jabs I'm so bad 
I make you flow bad, like when I blow lads to pieces 

No releases on the two steel wheels 
Comes the lyrical skills that kills more ducks than oils spills 
My niggas run for the hills, I can track 'em through the mountains 
Rico kick that kind of shit that got more bounce than Roger Troutman 
So pass the weed to the top top seed 
With lyrics as deadly as the VD's that make ya lungs bleed

Get on the mic and show these niggas where you at 

Here I am doing shows, wall to wall 
Nate stacks tall I still won't fall 
Never will I be sellout poverty, some don't believe in me 
Still I get my verbs on, my verse on, I raps long 
You're dead wrong, all in all should say the sale starts 
When AandR says go, you start with the dope verse 
And you're sold, now you're on clearance when the record starts selling 
But I'm not willing, to be uncovered from the depths of the under 
I'm under, for the duration 
The past present future revelation 
I gain the trunks of those who comprehend 
Because the know I send niggas through the other end 
Of this industry, commercial side envies me 
Females are freaking me, no time for 'em 
At least not yet, just a few that I will call bitch 
I'm not a player, strict rhyme sayer, say your prayers 
Now I lay me down to sleep

Ah it don't matter, we rock it for the whole world anyway 

Yo we gotta give a shout out, a shout out

[Declaime] 
So you choose to dance with I, the rhyme wise 
Who flies by over all heads at a fast rate, from the west state 
South Cali poet, you know it to be a Madlib Invazion 
And it's gonna take a nation 
To hold me back when I attack from all angles, 
Setting out traps that entangles, strangles 
All you got chokes, can't cope with slow folks, 
Break you down like po' folks 
Mad aggression while in session, never slip or sleep 
I be Declaime when I rain down with pain 
Cool with these ways of rhyme, at the drop of a dime 
My niggas creepin' from behind, 
Here's where I draw the line, you dare cross it 
I think you lost it ya losing your mind, also your soul I control 
Got ya tranced and confused, burnt, battered, and bruised

Hahahah... my fantasy is to line MC's in chronological order 
Tell 'em I'm mad at all of ya brothers, check out my strategy 
The time shifter as I inflict this rhyme constructor, 
You all are illusions so, peep out my mind state 
My agenda is to round you up and cause mad friction 
Take out you fiction MC's and then bring it back like treason 
I'm talking realness, everyone's speaking hip hop, but can't feel this 
I yield with my vibe 'cause I'm insured like Blue Shield 
I'm the Wild Child, I hear wack styles, time to get agile 
I'll come back with thumbtacks 'cause hip hop's mad fragile 
And then I'll cause accidents, mind state of a chameleon 
So I can come back and say Larry Parker got me one million 
Now Lootpack and Declaime represent MC's 
That'll set it off for Oxnard and my whole posse 
Wild Child with the style that'll wreck your body, 
I'm here to ""Break dat party, rip dat party"" 

[Madlib] 
Hey yo, niggas always trying to figure out what this style is 
'cause we go the extra milage 'cause your lyrics skeptic so just forget it 
It's Madlib the bad kid to bring the antiseptic 
My chemical warfare letting off hydra right beside ya 
Inside ya, it might ride ya 
Off the atlas, out this atmos, rappers becomin' like actors, the fact is 
You take a risk if you copy like a disk 
You stand alone if you tryin' to be a clone 
Rule number 4180 
It ain't only the record companies that's shady 
But they are a big part of this watered down art form 
Till Lootpack release the storm wave

For this '98 rain

Declaime,"[Kazi] 
I'm down with all the illest  ain't no crabs all around me 
So put your head together  you still couldn't find me 
Where I be and how I live is ill 

[Madlib] 
Hey yo  niggas always talkin' bout there shit is real 
""I gotta flex with a Lex in my video"" 
That's what half of these rappers be thinking in every city, yo 

[Kazi] 
Yeah, you want to fight don't ya, you want to bite don't ya? 
The involvement of a new coast is here 
To take your soul, rearrange it with flows 
You're unknown, come across our line, you get blown 
Too many bids, ain't no puttin' together 
Restorin' your body parts, leaving the rest for whatever 

[Madlib] 
You talking bout you want to freestyle, you want to flow 
But your flow be like oil and water, it don't mix 
And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids 

[Madlib] 
Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner 
Cause we on a war path, droppin' math 'cause we only want to 
Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real 

Episode #2: God's Gift 

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass 


Episode #4: Medaphoar and Oh No 

[Chorus: Medaphoar] 
Everyday it's like a level in this game that we live 
Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed 
Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold 

[Medaphoar] 
Straight in all black on the attack be Medaphoar so freeze back 
So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La"" 

[Chorus]",Episodes,1999
Declan,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a boy like me 
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now, I see 

T'was Grace that taught 
My heart to see
And Grace, my soul relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed?

If I should leave ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
I would need more days to sing God's praise
Then when I've first begun

Talk to me baby, tell me who I am

She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that trip was big, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name,
Man if I get a chance she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm aimin' my move, you know what I mean,
In order to be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
Bitch have got a, heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bathroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me

I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes

You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming

Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that Aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, ""Man, we got next""
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top

Drop the top back, your hair breezing through

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2002

Till the sunrise broke my eyes

Sometimes I wish I were you

Pour it all over me sweet love

Your honey kisses keep me fed

Wandering over the hills unseen

And the last Lion roars at the last dusty fountain

And you look to the North and a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn

I'm alive, I?m alive

When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning
And the future has passed without even a last desperate warning

Look and see her how she sparkles, it's the last unicorn

Paint your palette blue and grey 
Look out on a summer's day 
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 

Shadows on the hills 
Sketch the trees and daffodils 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
In colors on the snowy linen land 

Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen 
They did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 

Starry, starry night 
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
Swirling clouds and violet haze 
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue 
Colours changing hue 
Morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand 

Now I understand 
What you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen 
They did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now 

For they could not love you 
But still your love was true 
And when no hope was left inside 
On that starry, starry night 
You took your life as lover?s often do 
But I could have told you Vincent 
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you 


Starry, starry night 
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on name less walls
With eyes that watch the world and can?t forget
Like the strangers that you've met 
All the ragged men in ragged clothes 
The silver thorn of bloody rose 
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 

Now I think I know 
What you tried to say to me 
How you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 

They would not listen 
They're not listening still

Is trying to bridge the distance,
And all of the reasons why,
I'm so far away,
I know you can move the time,
And the space that falls between us,
I know you can cross the lines,
All I can say is,
Break them down

(Chorus:)
You are what's turning my world around,
Moving me close in the moment with a single motion,
Even when all of my stars are falling,
You pulled me from here to you

It feels like I'm falling down,
Through atmospheres and orbits,
And I'm moving without a sound,
I'm floating away,
But you are the satellite,
That makes the strong connection,
With messages through the night,
When the going is insane,
Send them down,
Cause they're keeping me alive,
Send them down

(Chorus)

A million miles away,
Is as close as a razor,
All the words I can't say,
In a breath of silence,
All the truth I'm looking for,
Is just beyond my shadow,
When I'm spinning in the night

You are what's turning my world around...

And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat
And when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it 
",I Can't Stand It,1996
Dee 1,"If you ain't dreamin', what you doing?

I dreamt of this day ever since I was a small child
And when it finally came the sky was filled with rain clouds
But when she came out, it all cleared up
That's when his boy became a man and put his fears up
I teared up as we started to say our vows
No more ""me"", it's all about ""us"" now
And the children we bring into this union
Never thought I'd live to see my dreams come true, man

Look, all I know is marriage, pops and moms did it
Grandparents did it, both stayed committed
At least I think so, but I can't go a day without dreaming
Of seeing myself married to Hip-Hop without a queen
And I refuse to be that old, lonely dude at home watching porn
Forty plus lurkin' around the college dorms
And uh, speaking of kids, I got a kid on the way
Nah I'm kidding but I dream to have 2 one day
Yeah

What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on

I've never been that dude that was dreamin' about the limelight
I just wanted to have fun and keep my rhymes tight
And then the fame came, now I'm a big name
I opened up my heart, and started spittin' game
So influential, helping you reach your potential
I hit the booth and touch truth to the instrumental
But really, what does it all mean
If you can't help others to fulfill their dreams

New Orleans is moated murder and mardi gra
Ima' show em'
Through the verses I'm flowin' through the seas that I'm sowing
Showin', provin' and doublin' to excel is just the beginning
Picture me rockin' stadiums, going platinum we winnin'
I lead an army of solders and beautiful, brilliant women
To dream as big as I do and expose the people pretending
Ha, they ain't real man
They're just real lost
It's hard times but these cowards still soft

What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on

Look, I dream I please God everyday that I'm alive
I dream that even when I'm gone my music never dies
I hate when I backslide, I pray I change that
My dreams and God's purpose
I hope they're on the same track
And I remember way back in '06
With that gun on my head, man I thought I was dead
Speaking of dead, a man's not alive just because he's breathin'
No purpose equals no freedom
Rise up

I had a dream that God looked like me
Clarence, 13 exit I was G-O-D
Can I admit, that kinda went to my head
But really who is God if he can't bring back the dead
With that said, in my dreams we live forever
No divisions of religion because we all in this together
Wake up, cause death is closer than it seems
And too many of us die before we try to live our dreams",Dream On,2011
Dee 1,"I was nine years old when daddy first touched me
At 15 I ran away and never stopped running
I met a man who took me in 'cuz I was pretty though
He said that you could make some money in my video
I get high and drunk just to make it through a show
And act like I'm enjoying it but really this is all a show
I feel degraded, purity obliterated
This is all I know and I really hate it
Mr. Minor are you listening? I know that you're a Christian
And got computer programs to block me from your vision
And every time you watch me you say that I'm the issue
Your pastor preaching about how not to let me catch you slipping
But maybe I'm a victim, maybe I'm just trapped in the system
And next time you pray maybe I might get a mention (please)
Before you talk about me remember that I'm lost
And your secret pleasure coming at a cost

Dear Mr. Christian, I know you’re on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I’d appreciate it if you take some time to listen

Dear Mr. Christian

Man I'm on that chronic
Higher than a comet
Sippin' gin and tonic
Drinking till I vomit
Tatted on my arms, tatted on my face
Pants hanging low, nina on my waist
I be slanging soft, plus I got that hard
Die for my hood, ride for my boulevard
I got love for my dogs but never for these girls
It's M.O.E. 'cuz money rule the world
But Mr. Dee-1, I grew up crummy
Saw my pops get killed in front of me
Saw my momma do dope in front of me
Felt like ain't nobody love me
Uniform dirty, dressing bummy
Went to school they called me ugly
Caught the bus they used to jump me
God I just prayed to you Sunday
Now it's Monday, I'm starving
Sip sour milk out of the carton
Talk to myself while I'm out walking should I put myself in a coffin?
I don't know! All I grew up with was trouble
Ain't know no role model, I knew the struggle

Dear Mr. Christian, I know you’re on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I’d appreciate it if you take some time to listen

Dear Mr. Christian

Excuse me, I don't quite understand you
Propaganda and banter and all of this empty chatter
And amidst these amens, hallelujahs, and shuckin' jivin'
I see a lot of hypocrites and hyper-criticizing
Mr. Lecrae my momma sold me up the river for some rocks
And daddy told me I was nothing but a problem
Now here you come telling me I'm a low down dirty sinner
And you got the nerve to wonder why I'm in these streets robbin'?
Well go and get batman, and go get back man
I don't need to be judged by you and all of your wack friends
Ain't gluttony a sin? Why you staring at my gin?
Where I'm from we don't pretend
We know we ain't gettin' in
Now the world don't trust me
And these streets done crushed me
Thought you were known for love but you just love to judge me
Truth is, ironically you need me around though
'Cuz otherwise you got nobody else to look down on

Dear Mr. Christian, I know you’re on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I’d appreciate it if you take some time to listen

I'd gladly sacrifice

It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace

The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart

Dee C. Lee,"[Chorus x 2] 
What's the question?  
Why are you flexin'?
Here's the answer; choice of weapons

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, The Remainz, kid, why you flexin like a bicep?
Heat on your hip just to get a rep; it ain't worth it 
Just because you pack a biscuit doesn't mean you can't 
Become another statistic; you figure it 
Life's a gamble even for vandalz; I handle mine with minds 
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest 
The fear of layin' in wreck causes the stress 
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best

[Guru] 
Yo, little big man, feelin' your oats because you're strapped? 
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black? 
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin' back 
You made a choice, and the choice you made was whack 
Kinda tipsy, with the liquid confidence 
Pullin' your pistol when it doesn't make sense 
To be the bigger man you figure 
But in the end, it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
Yeah, it's the master of the who, what, where, and the why 
But, still, I got a problem with seein' my brothers die 
I've been around and lived past the average age of us 
In every obituary, a full page of us 
The game is money, but what about inner wealth? 
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health 
But still, everyday, the city is a test 
That's why some people feel a gun is the best

[Stikken Moov 2] 
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation 
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin'; I mastered precisions 
Choice of weapon - should I peel or peel out? 
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

[Chorus x 2]

[Stikken Moov 2] 
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in 
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm 
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill, G 
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three

[Guru] 
That's why I wield the steel; yes, my microphone is crazy real 
I'm not the one sellin' out to get the mass appeal 
But jail cells are filled with my peeps 
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill-ass streets 

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
So, pick your weapon - a mic or a gun 
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns; check it 
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids 
One stepped to me, asked me to freestyle, kid 
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side 
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride 
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface 
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, you think you're all that, 'cause you pack heat? 
Seein' your own brother play the concrete in defeat 
Tryin' to prove yourself while you put the next man down 
But what goes around, comes back, black; best believe that

[Chorus x 2]

You know what I'm sayin'? 
That's all the real heads all over the world 
That realize that this music is real 
That we keep it real like that 
Peace to all my brothers on the third 
And all the real brothers in hip-hop 
It's like a rap's new generation thing, baby 
Peace to Guru

Our eyes met on the double take
The room stood still and the music drowned
Like a B-movie show on the edge of town

He had those eyes you wanna follow to a back room dive
And some bullshit story had me mesmerized
He didn't hold the door but he let me in

That boy was trouble, trouble enough for a girl like me
Trouble, but I was so caught up I could barely see

I got used to livin' by the railroad tracks
Where the hobos lived in chevys
With monkeys on their backs

But we were just a couple a junkies falling apart

That boy was trouble, trouble enough for a girl like me
Trouble, but I was so caught up I could barely see

Ever think you couldn't sink lower than the basement
Floor
Come to find much worse
Was waiting underneath that old trap door
Never had the nerve to leave until I'd finally broken
Down
Packed what I had, and took the last bus out of town

He wrote me a letter from a prison cell
Said he'd heard I'd gotten married and was doing well
Said he'd found his religion in the depths of hell

While a cluster of night jars
Sang some songs out of tune
And a mantle of bright light
Shown down from a room

Come down in time

So clear in my ear
Like it was today
Come down in time
Was the message he gave me

Dee Carstensen,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Out of town were the people I knew

What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I thought that he was here to stay 
But then he left me here 
To drift alone 
I'm lost in his love

Won't someone here

I'm calling love to the rescue 
I need someone to come and help me

Although I'm one more 
Shell upon the shore 
I'm lost in his love 
I tumble in my heart 
And try to find that hidden part 
Of love which seems 
To loose my very touch 
I'm lost in his love

Dee D. Jackson,"Just like the hands of fate 
I really didn't see you coming 
You caught me off my guard 
Within the forest fire I'm burning 
You got me reaching for the top 
Till I don't know where I can stop 
And straight down to my heart 
The very deepest part 
Where passion burns inside of me 

[Chorus]
Love is like a 
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun 
Tearing my defenses down to the ground 
Love is like a 
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun 
Spinning me around and around and around 
Love is like a 
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun 
Tearing my defenses down to the ground 
Love is like a 
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun 
Spinning me around and around and around 
I gave all my heart 
I gave you all my heart 

I thought I was alone 
But I can see now I'm mistaken 
You broke on through the ice 
And had me reaching for the heaven 
You wipe away the darkest night 
And blinded me with laser-light 
And breaking down the wall 
I let you have it all 
Boy I'm glad I let you through

Dee Daniels,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Dee Daniels,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Dee Daniels,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

No crib for His bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the heavens
Looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The poor Baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus;
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus;
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray!
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And fit us for Heaven

Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her,

Oh, lady, be good to me

So lady, be good to me

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars,1997
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,1997

So it wouldn't get lost no more

She herself was going to trim the Christmas tree
Christmas Eve she lit the candles, tossed the tapers
away
Little Jenny was an orphan on Christmas day

Poor Jenny, bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
She lost one dad and mother, a sister and a brother
But she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up when she was twelve
That into foreign languages she would delve
But at seventeen to Vassar, it was quite a blow
That in twenty-seven languages she couldn't say no
Poor Jenny, bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
To Jenny I'm beholden, her heart was big and golden
But she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up at twenty-two
To get herself a husband was the thing to do
She got herself all dolled up in her satins and furs
And she got herself a husband--but he wasn't hers

Poor Jenny, bright as a penny
Her equal would be hard to find
Deserved a bed of roses, but history discloses
That she would make up her mind

Jenny made her mind up at fifty-one
She would write her memoirs before she was done
The very day her book was published, history relates
There were wives who shot their husbands in some
thirty-three states

Jenny made her mind up at seventy-five
She would live to be the oldest woman alive
But gin and rum and destiny play funny tricks
And poor Jenny kicked the bucket at seventy-six

Makes a lot of common sense
Jenny and her saga prove that you're gaga

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2002
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar.
Oh, don't ask why. Oh, don't ask why.
'Cause I must find the next whiskey bar.
If I don't find the next whiskey bar,
I tell you I will die, I tell you I will die.

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"There's a far place, I'm told,
Where I'll find a field of gold,
But here I'll stay with you;

And they say there's an isle deep with clover,
Where your heart wears a smile all day through.

But I know well they're wrong,
And I know where I belong,
And here I'll stay with you.

For that land is a sandy illusion,
It's the theme of a dream gone astray;
And the world others woo
I can find loving you,
And so here I'll stay.

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now, a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

And we're lost out here in the stars

De tout ce temps que sera ma vie
De tous ces gens qui m'indiffèrent

Et ce matin qui revient pour rien
Ce coeur qui bat, pour qui, pourquoi?
Qui bat trop fort, trop fort

Même Paris crève d'ennui
Toutes ses rues me tuent

Et maintenant que vais-je faire?
Je vais en rire pour ne plus pleurer
Je vais brûler des nuits entières
Au matin je te haïrai

Et puis un soir dans mon miroir
Je verrai bien la fin du chemin

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

Dee Dee Bridgewater,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side",Ne Me Quitte Pas (If You Go Away),2005
Dee Dee Bridgewater,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love [Live],2006

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Echoes your laughter to me.

Dee Snider,"This is an SCG3 Special Report with Sam Romero.

""Good evening, I'm Sam Romero. We continue our special rapport now on the so-called monster invasion. As of eleven AM today, the president has declared the nation to be under Marshall law. Reports coming in now indicate that mass hysteria continues to spread throughout the globe. It is not yet confirmed by officials what is causing these horrific events, but it is suggested by certain sources that these creatures that are now being spotted throughout the world, are neither human... nor are they wild animals. It is strongly advised that people should stay indoors and if you encounter one of these beings, do NOT try to make contact with them... They will attack without warning! Our very own William Tracey in the sky is now reporting.

Will?
Sam! We're here hovering over down-town
where the monsters are litterly swarming the city!
The freeways are glocked
There is absolutely no way out of down-town.
These creatures, they are incredibly strong.
A few minutes ago we saw one actually pick up an SUV and throw it in a clump of people.
And then, zoom in on that, yeah.
Are we getting that? It's actually looking at us!
It's, it's climbing. It's
No, pull up, pull up, pull up!

[Sam:] Will? Ehm, we seem to be suffering from technical difficulties. We'll get back to William Tracy as soon as we get the satellite feed repaired. Hm... In the meantime, we now go live to Joan Carr at the Hellbender Plaza. Joan?...
[Joan:] Sam! I'm standing here with thousands of citizens. The first thing that greeted us when we drove up was the smell of decomposing flesh! The dead are litterly walking the streets! Aah... Even though the people know about the curfew, there is absolutely no trace of police or the military yet. It's understandable that the people feel the urge to get out of their homes and go look for their loved-ones. They don't know what to do and how to cope with all of this. Aah... Something is happening. Eehmm... Oh my God! RUN!!!
[Yelling]
[White noise]

[Sam:] We ehm... seem to be experiencing some more technical difficulties with Joan as well, so... Ehm... I'm just being told that someone is infiltrating our broadcasts. Eh... Are we going off the air?..

[Strange monster voice / Dee Snider:] Good evening, you puny little humans. Don't try to adjust your sat's, we control the transmission. Your deminion of the earth has gone on far too long. You've had your chances, you've blown them all! Now it's time to cut the bullshit. You are a plague! We are forced to take disciplinary action. Behold the sounds that will grind your insides, the sights that will make you blind. Your walls of iron will bend and the seas will run red with your blood. The earth will quake and open its fuming maw swallowing all the heretics and fools on the wide path to hell. The skies will open with a thunderous raw! My little pets will fly out in swarms that will block the sun. They will kiss the flesh off the bones of those who still choose to follow the false prophets. Join us or forever drown in the pit of despair. The Scartic Circle Gathering is now. This is the day of reckoning. This is...

Known as Elsie
With whom I shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea

She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.

The day she died the neighbors
Came to snicker:
""well, that's what comes
From to much pills and liquor.""

But when I saw her laid out like a queen
He was the happiest corpse.
I'd ever seen.

I think of Elsie to this very day.
I'd remember how'd she turn to me and say:
""What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play.
Life is a cabaret, old chump, 
Come to the cabaret.""

I made up my mind back in Chelsea, 
When I go, I'm going like Elsie.

Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it

We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Deejay Bonito,"Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike

He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man

She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love -
We'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it
I swear, livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby
It's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got   
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
  
We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
  
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
  
We're half way there

Deejay Sven,"We celebrate seven weeks Miker G and Sven
We took a holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind
It was the shine of the time we never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was short you gotta go to school

G's running up and down and everybody know
Rappin', rockin', poppin' in the street-kid-show
Miker G rocks the house and you know what I'm saying
Now when he's on the mic there will be no delaying
So you better run to see him in your neighborhood
He's rappin', rockin' all the way to Hollywood
Hey, check it out, these are the words we say
Yo, scream with us: we need a holiday

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Miker G and Sven are here to stay)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Hey, check out the new style we just play)
We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

I wanna holiday, I screamed a lot
Your only thing, school's the only thing I've got
Sven's parents told me I better go
'Cause Sven's hangin' on the street in the street-kid show
In the bar Rox what happened to you?
I told him it's my life and I know what I'm doin'
I saw the school I thought I'd never stay
Give me seven weeks again, I need my holiday

Well, this is my partner with the number one jam
Famous in the Boogie Bronx and Amsterdam
He's the fastest rapper, yo, his name is Miker G
His rap is stronger than the sucker MC's
Well, let me show you what my man can do
Rappin', rockin', poppin' and the boogaloo too
But anyway, no more delay
Just listen to the beat-box he will play

My name is MC Sven, and also deejay
I didn't like the schools, So I took another way
You like the Miker G, I use my voice
And soon I bought a big Rolls Royce

That's right, my name is Miker G
I use the holiday with the M.I.C
On the street was a party bigger than Hollywood
I grew up in this world, started in the neighborhood

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)

If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

Bite is the thing most rappers do
But I can write my own thing too
I can understand things most rappers say
Cause rappin' is my thing and I do it every day
I'm the number one rapper, yo, my name is Sven
I can rap more raps than a superman can
So I'm the guy on your radio
Also rockin' to the rhythm in stere-ereo

And you don't stop that body rock
And you won't stop that body rock
Yo, spell my name right, I'm Miker G
M-I-K-E-R and ""G, you see
Yo, M is microphone and G's genius
Miker G in the house, that's serious
And you know that, and you show that
It's time, Sven, so let's go back

He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

Déçu par mes shabs, je m'isole sur une barrette de shit
Gros sur la patate, Rick Ross sur une barquette de frites

Deen Castronovo,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Come on let's go Space Truckin'

Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

But I pray I'll be your last.

Deep Blue Something,"If I woke up one morning with my memory gone
I'd pick out some clothes and I'd put 'em on
And I'd walk down the street, and find a cafe
And I'd order a Guinness, and I'd sit there all day

Then some kids would come in and start a fuss
About how great their weekend in New Orleans was
Then I'd look down and smile like their tale was my own
I'd be drowning in memory, and then I would know

How it used to be in summer, so many years ago
When we really didn't worry, or care to know
Where we would be, or how old we had grown
Then I'd open my eyes and I know I was

Home, where my friends are
Even when I'm not, I wish you were here

Then it would rain, like it sometimes does
And if we were bored, it wouldn't bother us
We'd just get in the car and drive through the night
And be lost in East Texas, but no one would mind

'Cause we'd find our way home like we always do
Funny how the time flies in our youth
But with darkness approaching, we will all grow close
In the place we'll call Heaven but for now, we'll just call it

Home, where my friends are
Even when I'm not, I wish you were here
I'll see you at home

But now it sure feels like home
And I know this somewhere is really nowhere

With a neon Mickey's sign for no reason

The way you are now
You're never gonna make it in my kitchen
Still everyone's so excited
Last I was here I was convinced I was your favorite warrior

I've got a terrible fixation
Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy

You wanted me just for a holiday
Or was it to pad your resume?
What do you give me but unwanted breakthroughs
Strange how certain details subvert everything

I've got a terrible sensation
Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy

OMG! WTT!
Aww girl we been through hell about it!
Then I see our friends and
Everybody's so excited!
I'm standing over you eating juicy fruits till it gets in your eye!

I've got a terrible fixation
Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy

I've got a terrible fixation
Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy

Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy

Blackman

I am
I am a blackman
I am a blackman you scared to clap for
I am a blackman who likes metephor
I am a blackman whose antiwar
I am I

And the blackman that I am is quite sure
I am not pure
African fruits mixed with Cherokee juice
I am a black man with red clay roots

Arkansaw I am
Blackman speaking my I am truth
I am not trying to recruit
Youth for nothing but revolution

Solutions to overstand the I am
They be, unlike me
I am a man, and I am as unique
As you

I am the I who will stand for my truth
I am a blackman educating our youth
Sonnets to Ebonics
Othello in the East O

I am, the sum total of your hope
I am a blackman who sometime can't cope
With haters who hate on knowledge
I am a blackman who says go to college

Ignorance should be abolished
But the greatest teacher is a preacher
Whose mirror smiles and says to him....

[Chorus]

I am deeper than the deep blue sea, on a Thursday
Before Friday's storm comes to wash me clean
I am pretending to be a pretense of something I have always been,
I'm a number one raiders fan with no face paint, I ain't a chauvanist,

I like taking long walks by the beach and tasting clouds outside of my reach
As I walk amongst you, you don't need to know this history,
Just the here and now, that is how we learn to connect with respect
Connect with respect, we need to break it on down and connect with respect

This freedom you don't wanna let me own it, but like a donut fried in a vat
I keep popping back up, as tough as the day that you denied me like Jesus
Three times before dawn, the battle likes are drawn and verbal bombs are your demise
The lies you told yourself are caught in your breath,

Respect those who resurrect flowers from the melting snow
This is a rhyme about giving and living more than I'm taking
Escaping the hum-drum of the barrel of a gun that I never held
This is the voice of the book worm, this is the voice of the bookworm

Who's words storm earls like hurricanes
You insert the man

I am a Blackman
I am speaking
Gullah from the gut and gutter cause Gran D Coota be	 be Geechie
I be speechifying to reach the dying

Plying they minds with my halfway lies and faggot pageantry
And now, I beseech thee
Yeah mo be there over and under
The drum machines and creepy piano tinkling

Hoping you see me/I'm here to teach things
I am hoping you believe me
These quotes I wrote stuck in my throat
While I was swinging in yonder tree/my lover was singing

My brother was bringing for s/he
Blankets and sage and thanking him for being
But maybe that's just Phillip Bailey /wailing, entailing my fantasy
A prevailing notion/Claude McKay at the edge of the ocean

PLD toasting Jimmy B. at the party he's hosting beyond the sea
Where 206 times a hundred million bones be
Fresh and clean from four hindred years in saline
Gallons of tears for fears, pulling up the rear, hay baling

In the middle of the the barn and harms way
Obadike on Ebay/means you can't be that way and stay
But Pointfive don't pray so what to say?

Of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me

With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle""
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
""Silence!"" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'

Deep End,"From my window, I see roads
Lead to darkness, leading home
In the midnight of a soul's unsleeping
I hear the waterfall of women weeping

Hear the distant noise of traffic stalling
I hear the prostituted children calling
From the barred and mesh-floor streets
Of a winter's night, without a moon

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out

I look over chequered fields
And the towering web of steel
Young and old will sit and judge unfeeling
While the empty church's bell are pealing

And the green hills lay ignored, untended
Lonely watchers remain unbefriended
And out in the one way streets
Is a swelling maze, without a door

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here

Deep End,"They say that love often passes in a second
And you can never catch it up
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckon
But it's clear that the match is rough

Common sense'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open, my spirit ain't broken
Your love is so incredible, your body so edible

You give me an overdose of love
That just a little is enough

I'm like a connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste

Some people want an endless line that's true
But all I have is a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling, a kiss feel like stealing
Your love is like heroin, this addict is mellowing

I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place

Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island on the distant horizon
But the little I see, looks like heaven to me

And I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense'd tell me not to try and continue

The minutes of the day were golden
I recall that when the joint passed 'round
My body felt a little colder

But now I'm like a sewer channel
Running lime and scag
Let me get at the master panel
Let me at my stack

The sea refuses no river
And right now
This river's banks are blown

The sea refuses no river
Whether stinking and rank
Or red from the tank

Whether pure as a spring
There's no damn thing stops the poem
The sea refuses no river
And this river is homeward flowing

I have seen a trace of strain
In other's eyes, not spoken
I must admit that I enjoyed their pain
But this time it's me that's broken

I demand for you and His
This must be the time
When we decide what freedom is
Turn water into wine

For the sea refuses no river
We're polluted now
But in our hearts still clean

The sea refuses no river
We tried not to age
But time had it's rage
We're washed over the stones

From babies into clones of the mean
The sea won't refuse this muddy river
Won't deny the sulfurous stream

There was a fool in a dressing robe
Riding out the twilight hour
Lonely and cold in an empty home
Trying to assess his power

But now he's like a stream in flood
Swollen by the storm
He doesn't care if he sheds his blood
Let him be reborn

The sea refuses no river
Remember that
When the beggar buys a round

The sea refuses no river
And rain fills the gutters
No time for stutters

This is our chance
To sing and to dance and to clown
The sea refuses no river
And rivers were sprung to drown

The sea refuses no river
No pecking code
Respected for the damned

The sea refuses no river
Whether starving and ill
Or strung on some pill
Just 'cause you own the land
There's no unique hand plugs the dam

The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air

Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful wonderful life

The sun in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there

I need is friend
Oh I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide

A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery

I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn

I want you I need you I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you I need you I gotta be near you
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman

She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better she said
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star

She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died

Have you heard the news
Captain Bob, he don't pay no dues, ah
You know he's lookin' in my window
He's steppin' on my toes
Don't want the truth and it goes to show

I got a joker up my sleeve
I know what to believe
It ain't right just because
It's in black and white

Find yourself a hero
Treat him like a friend
You build him up and tear him down again
Tear him down again
It don't hold a candle, hold it to the light
Check it out, is it wrong or right

Well, is this the news of the world
It's just a pretty girl
She's all the news that's fit to print
In black and white

Inside information, taken down note by note
A silent footstep, that's all she wrote
Shit, that's all she wrote
You got no need to worry
The baby's gone to bed
Dreaming dirty dreams in black and white and red
Aah aah

Well, now I got nothing to fear
Is this the scoop of the year
Headlines on my bathroom wall
In black and white, hey

I got a joker up my sleeve
It's so hard to believe
It ain't right just because
It's in black and white

Deep Purple,"Maybe it's because I'm only starting
That I think it won't take too long
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing
That I think you've got it wrong

Maybe I could be like Robin Hood
Like and outlaw dressed all in green
Someone said, ""What's he gonna turn out like""
Someone else said, ""Never mind""

Well, I was big and bold and more than twice as old
As all the cats, I'd ever seen
I grew my hair and bought a suit
Of shiny white or was it cream
I shook and shivered danced and quivered
And stood on a mountain top

No one came from miles around and said
""Man, your music is really hot""

Well, I knew what they meant because I was a freak
Ah, my throat was tired and worn
My pretty face just looked out of place
As they poured on the scorn

I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
He said, ""My boy, we'll have some crazy scenes""
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
He must've been the king of queens

Well, I could write a million songs about the things I've done
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor
And there's another one for singers
It's die young and live much longer
Spend your money and sit and wonder

No one came for miles around
And said man your music is really funky

Well, I believe that I must tell the truth
And say things as they really are
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth
Could I ever be a star

Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'
Everyone's shouting out loud
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through
Where's my Robin Hood outfit

Well, I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye
No one even cared enough to say goodbye
The money's good and the time you have
Fun and games galore
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
And wonder what you did it for

Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place

It seemed that we would lose the race

This is a song about... 
Sweet child in time, you'll see the line

The line that's drawn between the good and the bad
See the blind man, he's shooting at the world
The bullets flying, they're taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have

And you've not been hit by flying lead
You've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
You'd better bow your head

Wait for the ricochet

I'm cryin' for you day and night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I want to hear you say

Sweet child in time, you'll see the line

The line that's drawn between the good of us and the bad of us
See the blind man, shooting at the world
The bullets flying, they're killing everyone
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have

And you've not been hit by flying lead
You've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
You'd better bow your head

than you. You're about seven foot fourteen, don't worry about it either... [indistinguishable] ...there's always someone one million stone heavier than you... [indistinguishable] 
- Here's a song which is also from the last album. It tells the story of how we recorded it and what went wrong when we did it. It happened in Switzerland, the song, a thing called Smoke On The 
Water, this one. 
Alright, wooh 
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time, no 
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground, now 
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky

Smoke on the water
But burning down 
You know
They burned down the gambling house

It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
He was pulling kids out of ground 
When it all was over

We had to find another place
Swiss time was running on
It seemed that we would lose the race 
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky

It was burning
Smoke on the water
Down to the ground, it was 
You know

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there 

A few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget 

Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
Everywhere
It was tumbling down
Everybody was crying 
- Thank you. 
Yeah, everything up here, please. And a bit more monitor if you got it. Ah?
-(...everything louder than everything else.)
- Yeah, can we have everything louder than everything else? Right. 
No one sees the things you do
Because I stand in front of you
But you drive me all the time
You put evil in my mind
I used to sing and say my prayers
Live my life without a care
Now I have become a fool
'Cause I listen to the mule
How can I change when my mind
Is a friend of a Lucifer hid in the ground
Just another slave for the mule
(...???..., yeah) 
- Ian Paice on drums, yes. 
Alright 
There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery 
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman, yes I have 
She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
Saturday nights from now on, baby, you're my star 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman 
Ooh, my soul, I love you 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman, yes I have 
She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glow with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died 
I want you, I need you, I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, ha ha ha
Ooh, I had a strange kind of woman, yeah 
She was so fat
She was the worst thing you've ever seen 
Ooh, my soul, I love you, baby 
- Hey, thank you, thank you.

You're lazy, stay in bed
You're lazy, yeah, stay in bed
Don't want no money, don't want no bread, oh, shut up 
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live, don't want to cry no more, no 
My trying ain't done no good
I said, my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort, no not like you should

Want no money, you don't want no bread, oh

Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.
I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.

Good Golly, said little Miss Molly
When she was rockin' in the house of blue light

Naked thunder to the crowd
