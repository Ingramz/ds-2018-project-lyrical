Allan Vaché,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me
For me",It's You or No One,1994
Allan Vaché,"I don't know why, I made you cry
I'm sorry sweetheart and yet
Though you shouldn't be lenient with me
I hope you'll forgive and forget
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?

Allan Vaché,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So 
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
Bye bye blues
Blues",Bye Bye Blues,1995
Allan Vaché,"I'm up in the world,
but I'd give the world to be where I used to be,
A heavenly nest,
where I rest the best,
means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

I'd give up a palace if I were a king.
It's more than a palace, it's my everything.
There's a queen waiting there with a silvery crown
in a shanty in old Shanty Town.",A Shanty in Old Shanty Town,1995
Allan Vaché,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1995
Allan Vaché,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;
 

",Who's Sorry Now?,1995
Allan Vaché,"Baby, I can't live to love you 
As long as I want to 
Life isn't long enough, baby 
But I can love you as long as I live 

Baby, I can't buy you diamonds and things 
Like I want to 
But I can promise you, baby 
I'm going to want you as long as I live 

Well, I never cared but now I'm scared 
That I won't live long enough

Allan Vaché,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1995
Allan Vaché,"Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love
",Goodnight My Love,1995
Allan Vaché,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
",Sleep,1996
Allan Vaché,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes For You,1997
Allan Vaché,"Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you in my arms with all your charms
The moon above and we'll make love.
I'll hold you in full view
Our dreams will come true

Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you
Give me a June night
Give me the moonlight
But mostly give me you

And when you're in my arms, 
With all your charms and the moon above
We're gonna make love, love, love
I'll hold you, hold you, and hold you
Then each little dream that we're dreaming will come true

Just give me a June night
The moonlight and you
Gotta have you, under the moon
Give me a June night",June Night,1997
Allan Vaché,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Allan Vaché,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1999
Allan Vaché,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1999
Allan Vaché,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me

Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you

Allan Vaché,"Got that old fashioned love in my heart
And there it will always remain
Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
Through these years and these tears just the same

Dry land may turn to sea but there'll be no change in me
Got that old fashioned love in my heart

Still, the magic of the night I met you

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Corcovado [Quiet Nights],2008
Allan Vaché,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay,2010
Allan Vaché Big Four,"Do you recall that night in June when first we met
Do you remember, Love, the words we spoke
Have you forgotten all the tender vows we made
In the silent magical moonbeams' light
Gone are the golden dreams with summer roses
And all our tenderest vows were made, but to be broken

Song of songs, song of memory
And broken melody of love and life
Nevermore for me can that melody
Fill the heart with the joy once we knew

Oh night of bliss, night of June and love
Beneath the stars, amid the roses
Oh, dream of delight that faded at dawn
Oh, song of songs, oh, night of bliss
When you were my whole world of love

When you were my whole world of love, of love",Song of Songs,1998
Allan Vaché's Florida Jazz Allstars,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
",Sleep,1996

Not worried bout money that you blow uh
Gossip doing rounds the more slutting that you do
'Cause I see you all the time in the line and you never pay
But nothings really free babe get it straight
In this place its the same thing everyday
Maybe nobody told you theres a better way
Doing everything you can to escape but you'll stay

And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make up
We make a really good team
And not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us

Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's ride

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are, we are, we are

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons

All I need is you
All I need is you, you

Eat a pill stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honor

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons

Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar

From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)

Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
on his target through a crowded market

No interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well)
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
'Til it spread widely

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there

All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high

Allen Forte,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.","You Don't Know What Love Is, song",2005

Allen Frizzell,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,
Allen Ginsberg,"When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy, 
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by; 
When the air does laugh with our merry wit, 
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it; 

When the meadows laugh with lively green, 
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene, 
When Mary and Susan and Emily
With their sweet round mouths sing ""Ha, ha he!""

When the painted birds laugh in the shade, 
Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
Come live, and be merry, and join with me, 
To sing the sweet chorus of ""Ha, ha, he!""",Laughing Song,

Of rainbows on a wave,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2002
Allen Savedoff,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002
Allen Shamblin,"I've got everything that a man could want
Expensive toys that lots of hard work bought
I just had to have what was shiny and new
I fed the habit and neglected you 
Then one night a light came on
I reached for you and you were almost gone

[Chorus]
If I don't have you I don't have anything
Even the gold is worthless in my ring
It's kind of funny the things we think we must possess
A ton of money can't even buy an ounce of happiness
If you're not with me to share what tomorrow brings
Then I really don't have anything

And if I'm not too late if you still want me to
I'll prove I've changed I'll make it up to you
When all these things I have are either broken or gone
My love for you will still be standing strong

Now I'm a different man
It took awhile but I finally understand

[Chorus]",I Really Don't Have Anything,2003
Allen Shelton,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2001
Allen Shelton,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So 
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
Bye bye blues

Right from the night I first saw you 
My heart has been yearning for you 
What else could any heart do 

Lady of Spain I'm appealing 
Why should my lips be concealing 
All that my eyes are revealing 
Lady of Spain, I love you

While ardent Caballero serenades

Round here they sing broken hymns
The prayers flow better when I’m soaked they're gin
The air is rusty and sits in the corner
Bad bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Watch their faces, familiar places
Even if they didn’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems bail themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of fight
This crown of thorns has punched the top my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the churches
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, oh the Lord immerses
Blessed in holy water, the sin of Holy Father
Have you ever smelled bless that smells atmonic Vodka
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Comment to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens I can read up on that doctrine
The people close to me say I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got tins that scole like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, bar more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the neon cathedral

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God, neon cathedral
Neon cathedral

Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of fight
This crown of thorns has crushed the top my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

Allen Stone,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year, 
Coming home to a place he'd never been before.
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again,
You might say he found a key for every door.
When he first came to the mountains, 
His life was far away on the road and hanging by a song.
But the strings already broken and he doesn't really care,
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.

He climbed cathedral mountains, 
He saw silver clouds below,
He saw everything as far as you can see.
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory.
Now he walks in quiet solitude, 
The forest and the streams, seeking grace in every step he takes.
His sight is turned inside himself, to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.

Now his life is full of wonder, 
But his heart still knows some fear,
Of a simple thing he can not comprehend.
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more,
More people, more scars upon the land.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
I know he'd be a poor man if he never saw an eagle fly,
Rocky Mountain high, the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high

Allen Toussaint,"I've got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild
I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child
The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived
They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived
And they were surprised to see us
So they greeted us with palms
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms
I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise
Wailing echoes down the corridors
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme
Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
For if I hold my hand outstretched
A little bird comes to me
I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars
Wailing echoes down the corridors
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""
And in this pit of sadness
Where the rank of wretched plunge
We've buried all the innocents
Now we must bury revenge
They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine
Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance
Though I seemed a long way from my home
It really was no distance
And I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam

And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause

A deep dark truthful mirror
And it's gonna tell you things
That I still love you too much to say

The ground was iron
And you fell all around the town
Until you looked the same

The same eyes, the same lips
The same lie from your tongue trips

Ring to the boots of roustabouts

On a fiber-glass tumble-weed
Oh, you can blow around the town
But it all shuts down the same

The same eyes, the same lips
The same lie from your tongue trips
Deep dark, deep dark, truthful mirror
Deep dark, deep dark, truthful mirror

So you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks
They set him up, set him up on the stool
He falls down, he falls down like a drunk
And you drink till you drool

Well, it's his story you'll flatter
You'll stretch him out like a saint
But the canvas that he splattered
Will be the picture that you never paint

A stripping puppet on a liquid stick
Gets into it pretty thick
And butterfly drinks a turtle's tears
But how do you know he really needs it?

'Cause a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey's hand
Jesus wept, he felt abandoned
You spell-bound baby, there's no doubt in that
Did you ever see her stare like a Persian cat?

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody

With his crying statues and his flying bomb
Goes 'round acting like the chosen one
Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin

He hangs up flowers and bells and rhymes
Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes
Fills up the air with his pride and praise
He's a big disgrace to our beastly ways

In the fashionable nightclubs and finer precincts
Man uses words to dress up his vile instincts

Give me just a fraction

Is save pieces of you

Into this very sad affair
Every time we do the decent thing
Somebody spikes the drink
And a single becomes a pair

That you wear at your best
That I keep pressed between the white sheets
Where you lie half undressed

I threw away my shirt and shoes
You looked and I dived in
It's just you and me now
'Cause I threw away the gin

I could hear that farmer singing,
As I cried myself to sleep

Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,
Beans of every kind,
If hungry is what's eatin' you
I'll sell you peace of mind,
But this ain't what you came to hear me say,
And I hate to disappoint you,
But I got no love today,
I got no love today,
I got no love today,
No love today

I could not love to save myself
From lonesome desperation.
Everything I thought was love 
Was worthless imitation.
My concept of commitment
Was to take all you could give,
I thought the cheapest thrills I loved
Were teachin' me to live,
But nothin' seemed to last or see me through
Nothin' but that little song 
That I still sing for you.

I think you much too clever,
For your own good I will tell you
What's right before your eyes,
Intelligence is no defense 
Against what this implies,
In the end no one will sell you what you need,
You can't buy it off the shelf,
You got to grow it from the seed,

I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound,
Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town,
I got okra, enough to choke ya,
Beans of every kind,
If hungry is what's eatin' you
I'll sell you peace of mind,
But this ain't what you came to hear me say,
And I hate to disappoint you,
But I got no love today,
I got no love today,

1. Vous corrigez votre attitude, il en était bien temps
C'est un élément déterminant, mais non, mais non
Mais, non, mais non,
Et vous pensez, oh, et vous savez, oh
Mais peu m'importe vous demeurez dans cet état
Où l'esthétique demeure à vos portes, stop
Je vise le naturel, détruis l'artificiel
Ce point de vue, euh, reste personnel
En d'autres termes celui de K. Mel ciel, dire, que certains ignorent les bienfaits
De leurs propres personnalités mieux vaut fuir
La spontanéité reste mon propre point de mire, vire, pire
Ceux dont la langue n'a d'autre activité que de s'agiter dans le vent
Non, si, ah oui, ceux-là même je les euh, non, euh, non non non, euh, même pas

2. Et je chute de bien haut en apprenant que sur nous circulent des propos
Compromettants, compromettants à partir du moment où, personnellement
Je m'intéresse aux ragots d'enfants, mis à part que dans ce cas les enfants
Paraissent bien grands, grands pour ces gens le mot est glorifiant,
Chiant, ils le sont la plupart du temps,
Intelligents ils le seront quand ils cesseront leurs tromperies
A tire larigot, go ha ha go hé hé go ha ha, go zéro :
Tous ces gigolos, zigotos, rigolos en un mot zéro, ne méritent aucune estime
Ils ne méritent que la peine du poteau,
la peine du poteau me semble faible montons le niveau
La chaise paraît juste, doublons la dose, oh c'est chaud
Oh la la, ou la la, mais ou ou mais là, la !

Au refrain

Ha ha, la peta est là
L'original s'adresse aux adeptes du funk, aux adeptes du rap,
Aux adeptes du Maze, aux adeptes de Puba
Ceux pour qui les réesoi ont un profil de combat
Se rendre en soirée en oubliant l'objectif premier
C'est avant tout le respect
Pour les danseurs en effet
Car il faut que la fête reste dans les têtes
Et me voilà dans un état plus que serein
Une fois n'est pas coutume, à moi de corriger le malsain
Tous les matins au chant du tsoin tsoin, hum, le remerciement va de soi
C'est pour qui, c'est pour quoi, c'est pour toi ? C'est pour lui, c'est pour ça ?
Muchas gracias merci et trace !
La langue pendue, la tête dans le cul, et l'esprit de mauvais cru
Où est l'utilité de prêter attention à de tels individus
Vous le savez ou vous l'avez su
Le tout est de tirer profit d'une telle expérience et par chance
De ne plus côtoyer à nouveau le fruit d'une telle semence
C'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes tellement Funky so Funky

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl

You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

You've filled my heart with weary old blues

She soaks in green tea lotion
Her legs are so outspoken
You'll think this girl is naked

The girl is always sexy
She loves backseats in taxis
And talking good and trashy

I mean the chic like you like just won't stop
Unbutton the top and later hear that k-k-knee drop
I could take you to the Opera and back to the block
Manolos and Gucci Lyn this chic is hot

For real and I mean sizzling hips get the twistness
Switchin' she keep all the playas whistling
She do the foo in bikinis and heels
The way she lick the bits and suck the ice and give a grown man chill

Oh girl when the attendant flip her own whips
Flew a playa the Vegas's for their own chips
Life of the party, the two step queen
She rapped when she seen me with them painted on jeans

You know I don't hit no better than her
Feel like I'm drunk when I see her and I slur my words
She's sexy and classy and she's my type
We can make it last forever just one night what they do, why, why

Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing

Lets me eat cherry pie

Will always keep me guessing
What's under that long jacket
I got this real bad habit

Alligatoah,"Guten Tag, was kann ich für Sie tun?
Ja, ähm also, ich wollt mich mal hier beschwern, ne also
Ich-ich hab das gelesen, ne? Nö also ich find das unfassbar'

Von sechs Milliarden, bin ich ein Mensch
Ich hab das Recht mitzureden, das ist mein Senf
Was da gerade passiert, da bin ich Standhaft dagegen
Lasst uns protestieren, jeder kann was bewegen
Ist doch Demokratie. Oder etwa nicht? Ist das zu glauben?
Es darf nichts passieren, ohne dass ich das erlaube
Ich habe irgendwo mit halbem Ohr was aufgeschnappt
Das geht mir auf'n Sack! Jetzt wird Radau gemacht
Ich lese große Sätze in der Regenbogen Presse
Nicht die kleinen
Meistens reichen schon die Bilder für ne regungslose Fresse
Das ist unverschämt! Wir müssen da was unternehmen
So eine Gemeinheit! Ich kann da nicht den Grund verstehen
Ich kann das beurteilen, ich bin ein normaler Mensch
Wer anders denkt, ist wohl total beschränkt
Jojo
Natürlich bin ich auch für Meinungsfreiheit
Meine Meinung ist so frei, da gibt deine klein bei

Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang
Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang

Wogegen sind Sie denn?

Ich bin gegen Dinge, die ich eklig finde
Den normalen Pi-Pa-Po gegen Krieg und so
Ich bin gegen das System, denn es ist Tot und Gewalt
Ich bin gegen Gewalt! (Ne, is ja klar) Zur Not mit Gewalt!
Jetzt dürfen Sie für die Verbrechen büßen. Guck, wie sie verrecken müssen
Die Statistik sagt, dass 80% aller Heckenschützen
Bevor Sie Hecken schießen, Speck genießen
Daraus lässt sich schließen, wir müssen Speck verbieten
Tierfell bringen sie auf der ganzen Welt an den Mann
Zur Demo zieh' ich meinen neusten Pelzmantel an
Ich bin nämlich so gegen Tierquälerei, da muss ich mein Mundwerk zügeln
Das macht mich so wütend, dass ich jedes Mal mein Hund verprügel
Ich bin gegen CO2, man wir sind am Ende
Kann denn hier nicht einer einmal an die Kinder denken?
Und der Himmel wird schwarz sowie Condoleezza Rice
Komm wir machen eine Demo, dass die Sonne wieder scheint

Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang

Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang

Wie würden Sie's denn machen?
Na alles besser natürlich! Passen Sie auf

Ich bin gegen Diplom, wer braucht so einen Scheiss?
Diese lebenden Toten, haben uns ewig betrogen
Das ist Revolution, ich betrete den Thron
Ich mach es besser denn von mir werden die Fäden gezogen
Dann lege ich los, die Arbeit ist hart
Denn das System hatte Jahre lang ein Penis im Po
Ich nehme jede Menge Geld und dann gebe ich's dem Volk, yoah
Da gehört es hin so wie ein Zebra in Zoo
Was? Berater? Was redest du bloß? Unsere Schulden belaufen sich auf mehrere Millionen
Ich seh mich gezwungen, das Problem ist zu groß. Alle Arbeiter bekommen weniger Lohn
Doch des ist zu wenig für meinen Mercedes in Chrom
Also müssen wir Ressourcen wieder aus dem guten alten Regenwald holen
Ja ich weiß am Anfang war auch ich gegen Korruption
Aber auch ich brauche mein tägliches Brot
Für die 100.000 Menschen hat sich's eh nicht gelohnt
Und am Ende führen eh alle Wege nach Rom
Was soll ich machen? Man hier oben kannst du nicht jedem geben es sind Prioritäten und so
Und jetzt haben wir den Salat, die Rebellen der nächsten Generation beschweren sich schon
Wie stellt Ihr euch das vor? Ich schicke ma' eben ne Armee zum Ozon
Ihr wollt Frieden. Aber Krieg aber wie soll ich Soldaten schicken mit leeren Patronen?
Wäret ihr hier oben, wüsstet ihr, man kann sich nicht kümmern um die Meinung von jedem Idioten
Ich bin einer von euch doch mir wird mit Schlägen gedroht, fickt eure Revolution

Alligatoah, (Kaliba 69), Terrorstadt, (Deagle), 2008
(Aber dick), Yeah, (Triple Penis)
03.07. , (Yeah ah), Donnerstag, (Bitch)
23 Grad Celsius, (aha aha), leicht bewölkt, (ha)
Ich habe mir den Zeh gestoßen
W, achso ja, ja ehm

Es gibt einen Ort, den hat der Teufel geschaffen
Zwischen Bergen aus Fäkalien, Mäusen und Ratten
Gibt es keine Sonne, nicht einmal 'ne Capri Sonne
Wenn mich jemand fragt, ich sag ich wohn in Babylon
Es gibt Dinge, die wünsch ich meinem ärgsten Feind nicht
Und zwar Geld, Bitches, Ruhm, ich bin von Herzen neidisch
Er soll merken, dass Gott uns hier mit Schmerzen peinigt
Es ist dunkel und der Wind fickt das Kerzenscheinlicht
Es gibt einen Ort mit mehr Ruinen als Häusern
Mit mehr Boutiquen als Käufern, mit mehr Routine als Neuland
Mit mehr zu frieren als Räuchern
Mit mehr Turnieren als Freundschaft
Mit mehr Druiden als Kräutern, mit mehr Stupiden als Deutschland
Fatal, nichts in meiner Hood stoppt die Qual
Auch gesundheitstechnisch ist die Lage suboptimal
Kakerlaken haben 'ne eigene Privatsitcom
Und die Vögel singen den Arschficksong
Battlerap, check, Häbsen, dir knurrt dein Magen
Perspektivlos wie Ketzer, die aufs Urteil warten
Es gibt einen Ort, der ist gottverlassen
Hände hoch und es sind sicher keine Softairwaffen

Sieh', das Tischbein ist morsch, doch es gibt einen Ort
Wo das Leiden vergeht, bitte zeig' mir den Weg
Ey, das Tischbein ist morsch, doch es gibt einen Ort
Wo das Leiden vergeht, bitte zeig' mir den Weg

Es gibt einen Ort, wo es wohlig riecht
Wo Milch und Honig fließt, Poesie
Wo die Katze der Maus hilft als bester Homie
Und die Frauen scharf sind, wie eine Peperoni
Da ist jeden Tag ein Festmahl mit Leckereien
Mit den teuersten Steaks und dem besten Wein
Glänzender Schmuck ist am Start, ich hab Gold
Und das Glas, ja, das Glas ist halb voll
Die Menschen sind nett, man versteht sich prächtig
Nicht nur thementechnisch, auch geschlechtlich
Denn die Sache mit den zwei, drei Jungfrauen
Bleibt kein Wunschtraum
Es gibt einen Ort, da wird sich gegenseitig wie Brüdern geholfen
Die Sonne scheint immer, wir sind über den Wolken
Es ist superkalifragilistikexpialigetisch
Super, Kalli fragt die Bitch, sie leckt ihm an dem Penis
Es gibt einen Ort, der heißt Paradies
Denn da wachsen nicht nur ein paar Radieschen
Also zeig mir den Freibier-Geysir
Ich will jetzt dahin, was soll ich tun, sag ich mach's

Sieh', das Tischbein ist morsch, doch es gibt einen Ort
Wo das Leiden vergeht, bitte zeig' mir den Weg
Ey, das Tischbein ist morsch, doch es gibt einen Ort

Nein, natürlich im Paradies

So bau ich ein Imperium wie die Haribokette
Lass die Idioten glauben, es gäbe ein Wunderland
Doch um es zu erreichen, müssen sie mein Untertan sein
Und kämpfen, wenn ich sie auf Knopfdruck losschick
Ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste, weil der Ort nach dem Tod ist
Der Drahtzieher, meine Krieger kommen aus der ärmsten Siedlung
Glaube ist ein Motor und ich hole mir die Fernbedienung

Eines junges Mannes der angeblich Terrorist war
Nun, was die Schandtat betrifft
Herr Staatsanwalt, verlesen Sie die Anklageschrift

(Ja, freilich)

Hohes Gericht, dem Angeklagten
Wird vorgeworfen, Verbrechen begangen zu haben
Unter and'rem sah man ihn C4 an Gleise legen
Sowie Geißeln nehmen oder Feinde knebeln
Zuletzt konnte man ihn in 'nem Bus erkennen
Mit einem Sprenggürtel, um ihn in die Luft zu sprengen
Er ist Terrorist und 'ne Gefahr für die Öffentlichkeit
Ich hab hier eine Aufzeichnung die den Scheiß beweist

Hehe, ein Wunder, dass ich noch nicht vor Lachen den Tod fand
Das kann ja jeder sein, da auf dem Tonband
Verdammt, schau'n Sie ihn sich doch an, meinen Mand-
Dant, er ist unschuldig wie ein Lamm
Ich glaub', Sie brauchen Nachhilfe in Kompetenz
Ihre Vorgehensweise spricht von Inkompetenz
Sie werfen ihm Verbrechen vor, doch er leugnet sie, Game Over
Um glaubwürdig zu sein brauchen Sie Zeugen wie Jehova

Ihre Wortwahl sollten Sie gleich zügeln
Ich möchte fortfahren mit der Beweisführung
Natürlich hab ich Zeugen, Tobi-Tait ist hier
Er hat die Aussage bereits gemacht im Polizeirevier

Ich lag so wie jede Nacht am Bahnhof und genoss
Den klaren Sternenhimmel und ne gute Flasche Scotch
Und da sah ich auf den Schienen diesen Mann herum spazieren
Er war Minen am platzieren um ein Attentat zu schieben
Ich natürlich gleich zu den Bullen gerannt, auch wenn Kaliba flieht
Ich sach er ist der reinste Drecksschwein, wo's überhaupt hier gibt
Er gehört in den Knast, dieser arschgefickte Spast
Er beruft sich auf Gott und tut was ihm passt

Tze, das ist ja lächerlich, aber ungewollt

Dann lassen Sie mal hören, Herr Rechtsverdreher

Oooh, der trägt doch eine Maske, Sie Idiot!

Ich kill dich mit der Pumpe und du tust noch an der Spawn-Zone chillen
Homies kommen vorbei um mit mir um die Häuser zu ziehen
VERPISST EUCH!! Ich habe genug Freunde bei Steam!
Oh Fuck, ich hab die Zeit kaum bedacht
Ich könnte langsam mal die Blumen
Was, schon 2008?
Ich hab den Hund nicht gefüttert, deshalb läuft er mir weg
Und ach ja meine Freundin macht Stress

Ich sag ich liebe dich
Du erwiderst nicht
Das verletzt mich halt
Doch das lässt dich kalt
Immer der gleiche Mist
Ich erreich dich nicht
Du sitzt zu Haus allein
Und zockst Counter-Strike

Der Hunger treibt mich raus und die Grafik ist sehr gut
Wie heißt die Map? de_straßenverkehr?
Guck, mein Magen ist leer
Ich rushe in den Kaufmannsladen (ahoi)
Trau mich fast nicht rein ohne Rauchgranaten
Wo ist denn hier die Buy-Zone
Ich hab Bock auf ne Tee-Tasse
Geh' zur Kasse, suche nach der B-Taste
Shit, ich komm zu spät zu meiner Freundin, was sagt ich bloß?
Die an der Kasse ham' geblockt und mein Ping war zu hoch
Wir wollten mit dem Wohnmobil andere Länder bereisen
Doch es ging nicht lange, denn ich hab die Camper beleidigt
Hätt' sie fast einmal erstochen mit 'nem Scherbenglas
Ich hab' vergessen, dass im Reallife man nur einmal sterben darf, sorry

Was ist denn los mit dir?
Ich muss dir etwas erklären
Jedes Mal, wenn du hier reinkommst unterbrichst du meine Konzentration. Ich verliere den Faden!
Das macht mich rasend, ich brauche dann eine Ewigkeit um wieder rein zu kommen!

Wir trennen uns. Disconnect! Hörst du das Ticken erklingen?
Es ist vorbei, wie wenn es heißt Terroristen gewinnen (lol)
Unser Zwei-Mann-Clan zerbricht, wenn du den Kopf in den Sand steckst
Du nimmst ihn nicht mehr ernst, wie eine gottverdammte Fun-Map
Das mit uns ist so sinnlos, wie mit 'ner Glock zu rushen

Alligatoah,"Die letzten 15 Jahre habe ich vor der Gedenktafel meiner Eltern gekniet und gebetet
Ich habe gehofft und darum gebetet, 
Dass mir ihr Geist hilft ihre Mörder ausfindig zu machen um für sie Rache zu nehmen

Ich war sechs, gerade mal ein Kind
Und rate mal was sind
Da die wichtigsten Menschen in deinem Leben
Ja es stimmt die Eltern sind vertraut
Doch welcher Spinner raubt
Dir diese Menschen? Nur ein Monster!
Ich ging heim, der Unterricht war Schluss
Da verwundert mich ein Schuss
Ich rannte, sah den Mann im schwarzen Mantel
Und als ich den Raum betrat, brach die Welt zusammen
Leblose Körper, die mal meine Eltern waren
Liebe starb, Hass wurde geboren, mein Lachen ist gefroren
Ich sinne nun auf Rache, yoar, Massenmord
Deshalb trainiere ich pausenlos
Ein riesen Aufgebot Soldaten schlag ich einfach mausetot
Ich brauche bloß ihn aufspüren
Und dann die Haustür
Mit ganzer Kraft einzurammen, Hab dich!
Er hält dem Mörder seiner Eltern die Waffe ins Gesicht
Der alte Mann dreht sich um, sieht ihn gelassen an und spricht...

Ich bin alt geworden, ich hab nachgedacht
Ich hab Fehler gemacht in jener Nacht
Von Rache besessen brachte ich Waffen zum Sprechen
Während ich heute weiß, es ist ein Teufelskreis
Ich hab mich geändert, hab Familie und Kinder
Doch es sticht jeden Tag, dass ich damals so blind war
Jeder glaubt zu wissen, was Gerechtigkeit ist
Also drück ab, doch dann bist du nicht besser als ich

Meine Vergeltung ist verübt
Und wer bist du jetzt, 
Ich bin der sohn, von mein vatter
Was hast du mit ihm gemacht du schwein
Tsst, ich habe ihn erschossen weil er war böse
Dich werde ich verschonen, Auf wiedersehen
Vater, ich werde dich rächen!

Es war ein Massaker und obwohl ich kein Angsthase bin
Hat ich nur ein Ziel, und zwar Land zu gewinnen
Rannte und landete im
Haus eines Greises, der Kungfu-Meister war
Er war weise, denn er trug weißes Haar
Und zudem wuchs ihm ein Bart
Er nahm mich auf und weil ich Rache verschwieg
Lernte ich den geheimen Drachenkampfstil
Und mit Waffen hantieren
Nach all den Jahren bin ich Karatebomber
Todesfäuste mit 'ner Gnade von 'ner Anakonda
Nach den 36 Kammern und dem hölzernen Mann
Zieh ich bewaffnet wie ein Söldner durchs Land
Und jeder Tölpel ist dran
Der ihn supportet bei seinem blutigen Spiel
Und mit dem Schwert mach ich die Suche nach ihm
Der meine eine Kugel verdient
Es ist so weit, ich hab den elenden Mörder
Nach seinen letzten Worten werd' ich ihn ins Jenseits befördern
Er hält dem Mörder seiner Eltern die Waffe ins Gesicht
Der alte Mann dreht sich um, sieht ihn gelassen an und spricht...

Vater! Nein! Ich schwöre, ich werde deinen Tod rächen!

Ich erinnere mich, damals, im Kindergarten, wer mein Lego stiehlt
Zu dem bin ich hin gerannt und hab ihm seine Spielsachen demoliert
Ausgleichende Gerechtigkeit, wenn du mich ficken willst fällst du tief
An demjenigen der meine Eltern getötet hat übe ich Selbstjustiz
Jage den Penner von Norden nach Süden und bis hin nach Griechenland
In meinem Keller brennt jede Nacht Licht, denn ich übe am Schieß – äh – stand
Habe gehört, dass der Mörder auch seiner Seits selber nur Rache verübte
Sie sagen, er wäre genau so wie ich, aber das ist ne Lüge, haltet die Fresse, aah!
Treffe die Frau meines Lebens, auf dieser, ich sage mal, Todesjagd!
Sie rät mir Gewalt zu beenden, die es schon seit Generationen gab
Es wäre ein teuflischer Kreis aus dem man sich nur befreit
Wenn man verzeiht, tut mir Leid!
Ich bin zum Hassen gebor'n, hab die Fasung verlor'n
Als ich an seiner Tür klingel verberge ich, dass ich am Zweifeln bin
Doch statt dem Mann den ich Jahre lang jagte öffnet mir ein kleines Kind
Ich seh' mich in ihm renne dann aber weiter ins Haus seines Vaters
Und halt ihm die Gun ins Gesicht
Der alte Mann dreht sich um und spricht (und spricht)

Hallo, hallo, wir sind die Boten unsres Herrn
Und wir bringen dir die frohe Kunde gern

Dir Liebe schenkt wie ein Familienmensch

Du lebst in Sünde, das war dir nicht klar
Darum sag ichs dir ja, du lebst wie ein Wahnsinniger
Und bald geht gar nichts mehr klar, natürlich
Du kannst dir nicht selbst helfen, wir regeln das für dich

Das verschlägt dir wohl die Sprache um der Wahrheit willen
Empfindest du dein Leben auch als tristen Schwarz-Weiss-Film?
Immer nur faul rumliegen wie ein Pflegeleichtes Kind
Wenn du mit Gott gehst, gibt er deinem Leben einen Sinn, joo

Du bist ein verlorenes Schaaf, ein verlogener Arsch
Du brauchst Hilfe das ist sowas von klar
Du kennst Homer und Marge, doch nicht die heilige Schrift
Das zeigt Gott nur wie Scheiße du bist!

Und wie oft wurdest du zum Sünder durch dein niederen Trieb
Zeige Reue und sieh wie der Leader wieder vergibt
Hast du nicht gestern Hals über Kopf ne Wurst geklaut
Komm wir reißen deinem inneren Purzelbaum die Wurzeln aus

Dich interessieren doch nur die Bitches, Bootylicious
Aber bald schon ist dein Leben von dem du gefickt wirst
Der Teufel packt dich mit seiner Hand an deinen Schuhen
Und du kannst nichts dagegen tun, außer per Bankeinzug

Tja also wenn du nicht willst, wir können dir nur die Tür zeigen
Und dich durchschubsen, denn es ist für dein
Platz im Himmel, das ist der Hammer deal hoch drei

Ich muss Kaution bezahlen für mein Frauenproblem
Mit leeren Händen geh' ich sicher nicht nach Haus
Denn ich hab mir ein kleines Missgeschick erlaubt
Hallo Schatz, ich hab ein' Pavian gefickt, heut Nacht
Keine Angst, Ich hab dabei an dich gedacht
Du musst wissen, dass das ein Ausrutscher war
Manchmal rutsch ich mit dem Schwanz in eine Frau, Upsala!
Verzeih, dass an deinem großen Freudentage
An meinem Platz nur eine Vogelscheuche saß
Ich war einkaufen und hab jetzt einen privaten Jet
Du hast mich doch gefragt, wo deine Kreditkarte steckt
Jetzt weißt du's, hey, hey! Guck mich an

Ich habe deinen Schäferhund gegessen und verdaut
Ich war zu deiner kleinen Schwester netter als erlaubt
Ich hab dich wieder mal mit der Toilettenfrau vertauscht
Ich glaub, ich schlafe heute Nacht wohl besser auf der Couch
Doch wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst
Und dem Glanz erliegst, dann hast du Amnesie!
Und wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst

Guten Tag, ich hätte gern ein' Eimer Rosen
Es ist so, als müsst ich zu 'ner Beicht-Pastorin
Also wieder mit Geschenk bewaffnet
Bevor ich der gekränkten Gattin das Geständnis mache
Hallo Schatz, ich bin mit Nazis down!
Spaß, aber ich hab HIV
Ich habe auch wieder angefangen, Geiseln zu schlachten (Terrorstyle)
Ich kann es einfach nicht lassen
Tut mir leid, dass ich auf Tabletten, Rotwein
Dir Sachen ins Ohr schrei, wie das mit dem Trostpreis, Macht
Der Gewohnheit, ja, mir ist da wieder ein Malheur passiert,
Das deinen Körper ziert, ich bin ein Störenfried
Schönes Lied zu bösem Spiel, Kennst mich doch

Doch wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst
Und dem Glanz erliegst, dann hast du Amnesie!

Dann vergess ich all meinen Kummer.
Ich wollte dir das gestern schon auf der Party sagen
Aber da war's so laut.
Du bist das beste, was mir passieren konnte, und
Und die Zeit mit dir ist ein riesiges Geschenk.
Ich genieße jeden Augeblick, und das jetzt seit anderthalb Jahren.

Was? Schon seit anderthalb Jahren?!
Dann ist jetzt auch langsam mal gut, ne?
Man soll ja aufhör'n, wenn's am schönsten ist.
Ich sag mal so

Sesshaft werden liegt mir nicht, aber es liegt nicht an dir
Dafür auf der Hand, die Frage ist nur, wie ich's formulier
Solche Sachen sagt man am besten durch ein ganzes Blumenbeet
Damit auch du's verstehst
Du kennst doch Nougat-Creme und Kandis-Würfel
Lecker, aber hat man dann zu viel genascht
Muss man schon beim Anblick würgen
Der Poet weiß, du warst eine klasse Frau
Aber nachts sind alle Katzen grau
Viele Sachen sind nur Phasen so wie das mit Che Guevara
Irgendwann ist man ja auch zu alt für Kasperletheater
Naja, verlassen ist ein hartes Wort wie Pimmelgesicht
Ich verlasse nur ein sinkendes Schiff
Die Geschäftsreise bis hier war perfekt, Kleine
Doch hat man alle GTA-Missionen durch
Kann man die DVD auch wegschmeißen
Man kennt das auch aus der Schauspielbranche zu
Langer Vertrag, keine Aufstiegschancen jetzt is

Erntedank, ich bin schwer betankt
Das Feld trägt keine Frucht mehr, die mich nähren kann
Erntedank, ich hab nicht mehr verlangt
Der Hunger treibt mich in ein fernes Land
Denn wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Die müssen weiter ziehen
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Nur keine Zeit verlieren
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Die müssen weiter ziehen
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden, Nomaden, Nomaden, Nomaden
Die bleiben nie am gleichen Ziel

Baby, ich weiß von deiner krassen Angst
Ich hab gesagt, dass ich für immer bleibe,
Worauf du dich verlassen kannst
Doch verlassen ist auch schon das Stichwort
Alles hat ein Ende, du kennst doch das Sprichwort
Siehst du die Rose hier? Die ist bald abgeblüht
Du warst mein schönster Fall, bevor sich die Akte schließt
Von meinem Aktmodell zum Auslaufmodell
Ich muss leider weg zum Wagen, der grad draußen hält
Mit deiner Nachfolgerin, für kurze Zeit mein Traum
Man kann den gleichen Kaugummi doch nicht zweimal kau'n
Deine Achterbahn ist abgefahren, ich muss zum Riesenrad
Es gibt so viel bunte Fahrgeschäfte in dieser Stadt
Das Leben ist ein Autoscooter, man bumst so rum
Und eckt halt an, dann steigt man aus
Stichwort Billy Boy, stell dir doch einfach vor
Das Büro hier wär' oval und läg' im Weißen Haus

Lasst mich euch berichten von einem jungen Mann
Seiner goldnen Ära und seinem Untergang
Alle seine Freunde sahen ihn als Genie
Er konnte ein Klavier auf seiner Nase balancieren
Schneller als sein Schatten über seinen Schatten springen
Ja, selbst Beamte ohne Keller konnte er zum Lachen bringen
So unterhaltsam, dass man ihn mit Lobgesang empfängt
Präsent auf jedem Fest, ein Virtuose am Getränk
Bei allen Frauen beliebt und eine balzte mit Begier
Ihr Angebot verfällt nicht, nur verfallen ist er ihr
Alle seine Freunde warnten ahnungsvoll
Doch Jugendleichtsinn folgt dem Ball,
Der auf die Straße rollt
Sein Herr wohnt nun in seiner Brust
Und lockt mit Frauenfleisch
Lässt ihn absurde Dinge tun, ja,
Denn sonst wird er ausgepeitscht
Alle seine Freunde ham' Distanz gewählt
Denn sein Herz hat ihm befohlen
Dass die Stadt in Flammen steht

Ich setz mich ein für Gerechtigkeit mit der Rifle in Action
Denn was die Wenigsten wissen
Ich war mit 'ner Armee Terroristen
In einer Gegend mit vernebeltem Sichtfeld
Wir brauchten Pläne und Skizzen
Da hab ich auf die Zähne gebissen
Bin auf der Wasserstoffrakete geritten
Ich überlebte, denn ich aß davor mehrere Schnitzel
Das war wie'n federndes Kissen, jetzt kann ich's jedem berichten
Und glaub mir, das hat echt was gebracht
Ungerechtigkeit hab ich quasi komplett abgeschafft
Ich bin ein schwerbewaffnetes Nervenwrack
Jetzt flieg ich 1. Klasse in das Herz der Stadt, Kaboom

Dieser Mann, er macht mich fertig
Der Trick ist lügen, der Trick ist lügen
Probier mal, da nicht schwach zu werden
Der Trick ist lügen, der Trick ist lügen
Wer so spielt, hat ein Ass im Ärmel
Der Trick ist lügen, der Trick ist lügen
Ich will ihm gern die Nacht gewähren
Der Trick ist lügen, der Trick ist lügen

Wie gut, dass er denkt, dass ich 18 wäre
Der Trick ist lügen, der Trick ist lügen
Und nicht ahnt, dass ich mehr als nur Schatten werfe

Sehr richtig, ich bin auch unter die Väter gegangen.
Ja, ist er denn auch so ein hochbegabter Knabe wie meiner?
Joa, ich will die Pferde nicht scheu machen, aber

Mein Sohn wird mal mehr als nur einen Baum säen
Er wird der beste Athlet auf Erden so wie in Raumfähren
Er wird ein Star auch wenn ihm Worte zum Gebrauch fehlen
Mein Sohn kennt Aufgaben, aber nicht Aufgeben

Dein Sohn nennt meinen Sohn später eure Eminenz
Sollte er nicht Papst werden, dann wird er deutscher Präsident
Für den kleinen Racker früh schaffbar
Dann fließt wieder Honig in den Flüssen dieses Landes,
Anstatt Süßwasser

Mein Sohn wird deinen Lümmel besiegen
Mein Sohn macht Gold bei den Olympischen Spielen,
Bestimmt in fünf Disziplinen
Weil er mehr Pokale hält, als seine Sportlergesellen
Es sind so viele, ich musst sie leider in den Vorgarten stellen

Dein Sohn wird bestimmt nur ein Spastiker wie doof
Aber meiner schafft Abhilfe, denn er wird Plastischer Chirurg
Verkleinert von jedem Fettarsch den Umfang
Wird gleich nach dem Medizinstudium Chefarzt mit Kusshand

Mein Sohn wird schon im zarten Alter Basketballer
Er nennt mich sicher nur spaßeshalber manchmal Sklavenhalter
Mein Sohn hat kein gemütliches Pensum
Doch er wird nicht mehr vom Üben abgelenkt
Seit meiner Bücherverbrennung

Mein Sohn wird mal ein umjubelter Musiker sein
Bringt alle Groupies zum schreien, gewinnt den Pulitzer-Preis
Lädt Videos hoch, als Philosoph wie Sokrates, nur Leckerlis
Wird rigoros zum Gigolo, schreibt monatlich zehn Evergreens

Naja mein Sohn entwickelt sich etwas langsam
Nicht bereit zur Arbeit zu gehen, aber bereit zu jeder Schandtat
Weder ganztags im Landrat, noch Kanzler oder Amtsarzt
Er ist jetzt bei der Bank „Bei welcher?“ Bei der im Stadtpark

Mein Sohn hält den Rekord im Hausverbot bekommen
Mein Sohn kann einfach alles, er beklaute sogar Nonnen
Mein Sohn ist ein Charmeur, ihm sind die Frauen wohlgesonnen
Denn betritt er eine Bühne, hat er faules Obst gewonnen

Niemals hat mein Sohn Probleme
Wenn es um Frauen geht, denn er führt eine Homoehe
Sein Werdegang ist schwer und lang, doch es reicht bis zum Doktor
Mein einziger Sohn ist jetzt meine einzige Tochter

Mein Sohn hat die größte Wohnung im Kellergeschoss
Mein Sohn ist der stärkste seiner Zellengenossen
Er ist schon lange da wohnhaft, er lebt mit Ansgar und Olaf
Die geben ihm Liebe, denn er war neulich Gefang'ner des Monats

Mein Sohn war einst der Stolz meiner Sippschaft
Jetzt macht er für's gemeine Volk leider Hip-Hop
Ist zwar kein Musiker, aber wurde vom Tellerwäscher
Hinter'm Kellerfenster zum Backup-Rapper, trotz Textversprecher

Kommt mein Sohn raus, läuft er Amok nur mit Axt und Motorsäge

Und ich gab jedem Trauerfeierlied dieselbe Chance
Keins war genug monumental und herzzereißend,
Von Queen bis Elton John
Diesen Harfensängern überlasse ich doch nicht die Show auf meiner großen Todesfeier
Hier der Song vom Zeremonienmeister
Das Fest beginnt, ich stell es mir gigantisch vor
Ich hoffe doch ihr habt mir einen Elefant besorgt
Ich seh' prasselnden Regen, in der Masse fließen Tränen
Kinderaugen fragen, wann sie Papa wieder sehen
Es gibt noch Fotos, da kann man mich in kraftbepackter Pracht betrachten
Ich hab auch T-Shirts und Kaffeetassen machen lassen
80 Tacken, die Bestattungskasse schluckt
Wer keins mehr kriegt, kann auch wahrscheinlich Bilder meiner straffen Brust
Auf allen privaten und offenen Kanälen, in Blogs und in jeglichem Wochenblatt sehen
Ich geh' mal davon aus, dass das geklappt hat mit meiner Modellkarriere
Trotzdem Danke, für das zahlreiche Erscheinen
Aber ja nicht streiten, etwas Wartezeit und jeder darf sich vor dem Sarg verneigen

Bevor ich zu den Sternen schweb'

Hört ihr den Wind in den Bäumen singen?
Ich werd' euch den Weg weisen
Ich bin hier oben, über euch wie schon zu Lebzeiten
Dir, holde Maid, bin ich ein Schutzengel im Wolkenreich
Wenn du jemand anderen fickst, dann werd' ich eher Poltergeist
Jungs, ich werd' euch auch fehlen, oder?
Denkt daran, dass ich euch stets mein Haustelefon gab
So viel gute Taten, alter, sogar schon der Bäcker im Dorf
Meinte, wenn ich weg bin ist die Welt ein besserer Ort
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Also die Drecksarbeit
So 'n Mausoleum bleibt nich' von alleine fleckenfrei
Und rächt meinen Mord doch schafft euch Heimvorteil
Wenn er mich besiegt hat, muss er ein Cyborg sein
Hab mittlerweile mir bestimmt 'ne Religion zugelegt
Um so so gut es geht, der Angst vor dem Tod souverän zu entgehn
Hab nie großspurig Hochmut gelebt
Doch Paradiese reißen sich um mich, losbudenmäßig, ey

Ich bin verliebt,
Sieht man doch.

Es ist eine wunderschöne Sommernacht
Ich chill' mit Kontrabass im Monstertruck
Vergrabe Nudeln und ihr fragt mich wozu
Denn ich lache und beginne, aus der Nase zu bluten
Guck mal, seit Tagen red ich lediglich mit Fabelwesen
Ich sammel' Fotos meiner schönsten Grafikfehler
Und ihr sagt, ich wäre seltsam geworden, ja ja ve ve
Ich sitze da und les AGBs
Verrückt, ihr wollt ein beschissenes Spiel?
Glotze aus, ich trinke jedesmal, wenn nix passiert und
Dann rauf auf den Balkon, ich brülle Nazitexte
Sorry, hab mich grade mit dem Papst verwechselt
Damn Girl, weil du hinreißend bist
Tätowier' ich dein Gesicht in mein Gesicht
Mir ist alles scheißegal, ich würde Kinder erschießen
Was blind? Ich bin geistig behindert vor Liebe

Dann stand sie einfach so da
Ist sie der heilige Gral?
Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd' ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?
Wer weiß?

Extrablatt, verseuchte Gewässer, will mich entschuldigen
Doch sage, Hurensohn! Freudscher Versprecher
Ich habe neulich im Affekt Medizin studiert
Und dennoch weiß ich nix von ihr außer, ich liebe hmm
Zurück zur Ironie, guck, ich bin Schnäppchenjäger
Und mach mir 'ne Geschlechts-OP klar, YOLO!
Ich werde nie zur Ruhe kommen
Auf Fotos siehst du mich nur verschwommen
Ihr sagt, ich hab mehr Craziness als das gelähmte Kind
Das auf Kekse wichst, hahaha versteh' ich nicht
Irgendwas hat mein' Schädel-Innenraum zerstört
Jetzt hab ich sogar mit dem Trinken aufgehört, was soll ich tun?!
Suizid scheidet aus, denn Marktforscher wissen
Ihr würdet Alligatoah vermissen
Aber mäh' ich wieder Rasen solltet ihr euch in den Zimmern verkriechen

Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd' ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?

Ich habe keine andre Wahl, Robben schlachten!

Denn ich kämm' jeden Tag meinen glänzenden Bart
Und die Männlichkeit verschwindet durch Extensions im Haar
Ach ja, warte mal
Jetzt hab ich gerade nachgedacht und glaub mir das war hart
Ich hab noch immer keinen Plan
Ob jetzt die Nadel in meinen Haaren passt (Wozu denn?)
Ja zu der Farbe von meinem Nagellack (okay) mein muskulöses Kreuz
In Verbindung mit dem Lipgloss und der Brustbehaarung
Deutet darauf hin dass ich 'ne Schwuchtel bin aber guck doch mal das täuscht
Ich bin ein Mann gewesen, aber innerlich 'ne Frau
Schon von Geburt an spürte ich mit meinem Pimmel ist was faul
Es war einfach das Letzte, doch jetzt zeig ich es dem Rest
Ich muss nur extravagant ein paar Highlights setzen
Und nach ein, zwei Schnäpsen bin ich reif für Action

Oder der Dreitagebart
Oder mein kleiner Pirat, ich geb 'nen Scheiß, was ihr sagt

Komm frag doch mal Mike“
Mike hatte auch keine Zeit
Ja das enttäuscht mich ein bisschen.

Wie komm ich endlich wieder näher zum G-Punkt?
Vielleicht „mit so einer Art Scherenbewegung“.

Du glaubst mir nicht und hältst es für einen faulen Trick
Dabei sind meine Lippen doch schon Taub vom Stift
Und ich trage ein Hauch von Nichts
Halt dein Maul pscht, glaub mir diese Titten sind echt,
Fass sie ruhig an aber vorsicht mit dem spitzen Besteck
Was stört dich denn?
Ist es das Kurzhaar?
Unter der Burka?
Oder mein Schnurrbart?
Ich bin die Venus der Herzen, mache nur was Damen machen
Ist auch der Adamsapfel groß wie ein Fahrradsattel
Bin ich dir nicht schön genug? (Doch, doch doch)
Seh' ich dick in dem Kleid aus? (Nein!)
Oder hängt wieder mein Dick aus dem Kleid raus?
Wenn wir über Weiberthemen streiten
Kommt es öfter mal zu Kneipenschlägereien
Es gab leider Hefeweizen
Willst du mich jetzt diskriminieren
Nur weil ich zum Stressabbau, Leuten in die Fresse hau?
Das ist mein Recht als Frau

Sie holen Hubschrauber, denn der Handtaschenräuber flieht

In einem abgezäunten Gebiet, wo's keine Nachtbeleuchtung gibt
Hab' ich Verdacht und Neugier, was ist euer Ziel?
Seid ihr verkackte Teufels-Diener? Erschafft ihr Leukämie?
Ihr leugnet meine Theorie? Das bedeutet Krieg
Du frisst den Pflasterstein, wenn du nicht gleich das Plappermäulchen schließt
Und man findet dich in irgendeinem Kaff bei Neuruppin
In einem Fass mit Säure, weil dich sonst die Nachbarsleute riechen
Glaub mir, das is' kein Rollenspiel, das bedeutet Krieg
Obwohl ein Graben zwischen unser'n beiden Fachwerkhäusern liegt
Machst du ein' Freundschaftsdienst indem du meine Apfelbäume gießt
Ich bedanke mich mit einem selbst gebackenen Streusel-Quiche
Du machst ein Schmatz-Geräusch zu viel, das bedeutet Krieg
Ah, ja ich hasse Deutsch-MCs, es gibt Asiklatsche
Während sie an der Wasserpfeife ziehen
Komm zum Battle, deine Waffen sind 'ne Rachenfäule
Und auf mich mit Wattebäuschen zielen, das bedeutet Krieg
So lang mein Haschverkäufer dealt
Rauch' ich wie ein Apachenhäuptling Piece und meine Nase muss wie Ackergäule zieh'n
Wenn man noch Schnaps ins Feuer gießt, krieg' ich Hassgefühle
Wenn man mir das Kraftfahrzeug entzieht, das bedeutet Krieg

Vielleicht, weil es nach jedem meiner Trinkgelage Imageschaden gab

Guten Morgen, der feine Herr Gatoah

Ich bin ein Phänomen, ich bin 10 von 10
Geometrisch perfekt, wie ein LEGO-Face
Ich hab' den YouTuber-Look, wie im Buch und gedruckt
Jeden Tag fress' ich ein neues Beautyprodukt
Ich schütze mich, denn ich lese nie die Preisschilder
Sie dulden keine negativen Weibsbilder
Und sie dulden keine Gesichtsfalten

Weder Lesen, noch Schreiben, noch was anderes
Du bist schön, aber dafür kannst du nichts
Du kannst nicht mal was dafür, dafür kannst du nichts

Im Frühling denkt das Röslein
Wer nicht leiden will, muss schön sein

Das versteh' ich nicht
Dabei geb' ich mir doch Mühe, jede Luxus-Modemesse gibt mir Komplimente
Schöne Benutzeroberfläche! Und sie machen mir ein Angebot, das Freude weckt
99% Reduziert auf mein Äußeres
Ich muss in die Sachen passen, hab' ich Hunger, gibt es Kochwäsche
Manche tragen nur dieselben Schrottfetzen
Ich trag' jeden Tag was anderes Stoffwechsel
Frag nicht, wie alt die sind, die meine Kleider nähen
Auf einer Skala von eins bis zehn
Tja, denn Kleider machen Leute, doch die Leute, die die Kleider machen
Leisten sich bis heute leider weniger Designerjacken
Ich schweife ab - Spieglein im Handy: Bin ich der King?

Durch Korruption ergattertem Logen-Platz
Du kommst mit Notenblatt, wir haben uns tot gelacht! (Guck ma')
David gegen Goliath
Ist aus 'nem Märchenbuch voller erlogenem Quatsch
Bevor du Feuer bei der Generation entfachst
Fahren wir Hovercraft durch eine Mondlandschaft
Ein Anti-Kriegs-Klangerzeugnis?
Pff, ganz was Neues
John Lennon hat das schon in den 70ern gemacht
Hat ja richtig was gebracht

Du machst ein Lied, gegen die gemeine Welt
Und in China hat gerade jemand Reis bestellt
Dann kommt der Krieg wieder, dann begreifst du schnell:
Musik ist keine Lösung
Die Melodie löst bei ihnen Hoffnung aus
Heute hebt das Festivalgesocks die Faust
Aber morgen wachen sie in ihrer Kotze auf

Was willst du? Menschen mit deinen Liedern tragen
Von der schiefen Bahn zur Zivilcourage?
Über allen Krisen-Staaten Friedensfahnen?
Willst du noch 'ne Niere haben?
Denkst du, du bist jetzt die Stimme der Gesellschaft?
Die finden dich solange cool, bis du Geld hast
Vielleicht wirst du von manchen für den mutigen Schritt geliebt
Andere sagen: Der will doch nur gute Publicity!
Nein, es ist nicht leicht, du musst Gegenwind verkraften
Zweifelhafte Leute aus der falschen Ecke werden für die nächste Single klatschen
Zum Beispiel Anzug-getarnte, rechtsextremgesinnte Spasten
Die dein Video posten weil sie kalkulierte Jagd auf jugendliche Wählerstimmen machen
Klar, denn keiner versteht deine Texte nach einer Jever-Palette
Du hast mehr Schnapsleichen auf dem Gewissen, als Leben gerettet
Die Satire wirst du schwer im Dorf erläutern
Es sind Perlen vor die Säufer
Schenk den Menschen Botschaften und dein Temperament
Sie werden nur darüber streiten wer dich länger kennt
Glaub mal nicht das da irgendetwas hängenbleibt

In einem Gefängnis bedeutsam sei
Wir haben einvernehmlichen Sex, ah, einvernehmlichen Sex, durch
Einvernehmliche Peitschenschläge wird keine Regel verletzt
Ich würge sie mit zwei Dingen: Leinentape und Respekt
Sie muss nur ein Zeichen geben, die Machtverteilung dreht sich komplett
Es ist ein zeitgemäßes Konzept, wir sind so zeitgemäß (yeah)
Meine Hoe ist keine Zahl zwischen eins und zehn
Bitch, meine Hoe ist außerdem keine Austauschware, Punkt
Du willst wissen, wie sie aussieht? (Ja?) Augen, Nase, Mund
Sie muss sich bücken, denn sonst kann sie ja auch nix hochheben
Meine Hoe wird gefickt vom Leben
Meine Hoe ist schön, ohne den Gebrauch von Glitzernägeln
Denn man kann ihr die Schicksalsschläge im Gesicht ablesen
Mal entspricht sie der Erscheinung eines Stripper-Mädchens
Mal eher der von einem Grizzly-Bären
Oder Grizzly-Bärin! Doch die Mischung zählt
Sie ist nicht so wie die andern, aber nichts gegen die andern

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow

But his mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss

The big top is crumbling down
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
Where you should be, no one's around

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I need a big love
I need a phone call

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat

And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you
I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train
If I listen real hard
And I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Does he tell you when you're sorry?

Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Three for girls and four for boys
Five for silver
Six for gold and
Seven for a secret never to be told

Sleeping underneath your skin
When you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in

of your wasted life

Shut me up then make me sing, sing, sing

But you get your kicks out of causing me pain, pain, pain

You always pick me up
And then you hold me down

'Cause it gives me everything I want
And they don't know what it's like when you need somebody
To the point they can do no wrong
We always fight and then I open up my door

All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave
Would be a cold day in July

I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

You said that we were gonna last forever 
You said our love would never die

It feels like sunny weather

Gave a fine little bijou to the world
With a blacksmith for a makeshift doc
In a cathouse far from camelot

When the child screamed from life's first slap
The bawd said kid get used to that
You'll never meet a day that isn't cruel
Then she wrapped her babe in a petticoat
Grabbed a bottle and made a toast
Here's to my gorgeous bastard ruby jewel
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel
Reared among the guttersnipe
While her mama puffed the chinese pipe
The salad days for ruby didn't last
Forced to work and pay her dues
Inside that poor man's moulin rouge
The snot-nosed kid had to grow up fast
Night and day she'd toil and sweat
While brothel patrons placed their bets
On who would be the first to break her in
Then one night the madam screams
Ruby get to room thirteen
There's someone there who thinks you're quite a gem
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby no not ruby ruby jewel
In done up hair and a borrowed dress
She climbed the stares scared to death
Said a prayer and tip-toed through the door
But on deaf ears her prayer fell
Cause through her tears she stared at hell
Standing there in nothing but his drawers
She recognized the whiskered chin
Bloodshot eyes and foul-mouthed grin
He was the man who wore the silver star
She tried to turn around and run
But he pulled out his big six gun
And said whore you won't get very far
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel

A crimson pool between her legs
Naked as the day that she was born
But lying there next to him
Made her wish she hadn't been
If this was all that living had in store
Making sure he was asleep
She quietly got to her feet
Found his gun and aimed it 'tween his eyes
She kept it there 'til he came to
So he could stare down the barrel too
Pulled the trigger once and watched him die
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby no not ruby ruby jewel
On a rainy night in nineteen-twelve
Locked inside the town's new jail
Ruby carved a message in the stone
When morning came hacks led her out
In ankle chains right through the crowd
Who waited in the mud to watch the show
They walked her up the gallows steps
But the rope around her neck
Dropped the trap as all the watchers cheered
But on the wall of her cell
In a tiny scrawl and misspelled
Were the words ruby jewel was here

And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel

Allison Moorer,"I'm skipping across the stars
Hopping from moon to moon
Higher than a kite's been before
Made my way to Mars
Venus and Neptune
If I was scared of heights
I ain't no more

Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high

A lot of astronauts have left the planet earth
But they use rocketships to kiss the sky
I don't have what they got
But I sail the universe
Everytime your lips are kissing mine

Floating way down there in the blue

Back when I was green
You could find me chooglin' smoke
But when I got off I never left the ground
Now you can't find me
Unless you have a telescope
And I don't want to ever come back down

It's just a watering hole but many a soul go there to quench their thirst
When my whistle's dry there's nowhere that I can think of I'd rather be
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
It has thirty cent draws and that's because they only cost Tony two-bits
See it's Tony's joint and he makes it a point to let every poor bum get lit
He's a drunk's patron saint and he won't hesitate to fix you some supper for free
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
Each morning at eight it opens it's gates for all my buddies and me
With our foots on the rail and our buckets of ale we tell stories no one believes
We spit and we cuss at the lives that left us then toast to our freedom with glee
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
I sit tight each night til they turn up the lights empty my last one and leave
Then squint my eyes at the dawn in the sky as people walk by on the street
God only knows where it is they go but there's only one place for me
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree

His ugly is awfully hard to take

With a real bad case of the shakes

He likes us pale and sick guys
Who are only skin and bones

Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me

It was the same old same how have you been

Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

You reminded me of brighter days

I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church

I was off to drink you away

I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Allison Moorer,"She never says a thing
About a bad situation
Some say the song
She knows
She looks for the question
Of the answer of the prayer

She knows where she goes
Her worldly possessions
Could vanish without a trace
Just some dishes some pans
Some clothes
And so shes turned in the pages
Of an undying faith
She knows well where she goes

Her window is open
The weather comes in
The doorway moves as it blows
She stares through her memories
And the places shes been

She knows where she goes
Shes so full of fire
But she cant reach no torch
Too much wind for those

She can walk out to springold
And never leave the porch
She knows where she goes

She washes her hands 
In the cold dark water
Turning from something she knows
She longs to be free
But her reflection has guided

She knows where she goes
Oh, she knows where she goes",She Knows Where She Goes,2008

With the seconds running give you the jitters?

planning to poison water supplies to bring the second-coming quicker

Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give em coca-cola for their property
Give em gum, give em guns, get em young, give em fun

And don't give em all, no ,man, just give em some

Cut off blue jeans torn and frayed
Swinging on the barnyard gate
It don't get dark till after eight
Run inside a kiss and hug
Wrapped up in my mama's love

And all I need
Could I please get from you

I just wanna get laid

I just wanna get laid
Don't care how good she looks
I just wanna get laid
Tonight and every night for the rest of my life

I ain't got much
Just pictures on my wall
It's not that much but it'll do
My friends all laugh
They have no symptahy
I guess I'll be the last one to screw

they say I'm scared
And unprepared
Could I please learn from you

I was with a girl who tried to sleep with my best friend
We both took comfort in each others messy lives
Finding warmth on that cold November night
We swore it'd be years before we brought that on again
Days later you said that we should be more
Than just friends
I let my guard down cause the feelings were so strong
But acted stupid and that's when he came along

But I keep hoping that you'll swim back to me

You got my quirkiness and awkward sense of humor
We shared Simpson quote and started made up rumors

If night turned into day you'd hide me from your mom
I could never fight with you cause you were never wrong
This time especially the blame is all on me
If I'd not screwed things up I wonder where we'd be

One day for no reason I broke our date
So you made other plans that day
And that's when you met him
And why you're still with him today

These are thoughts from the past not to pick my brain
And now I feel like screaming to the world
Cause this highways going nowhere
And the lines have all been blurred
By the rain that's falling down in front of me
So I clear the windshield just to find
Another cross to mark the passing of a life
It's a crystal clear reminder
That all things come to an end
And I wonder when that end will come for me

When the lights go down
And the clocks time out
And the bells just don't chime anymore
Is it tragedy that we can't see
What lies on the other side of every single smile

I've been asking myself for the third straight night
If there's truth in the writings that shape our lives
Now I feel like screaming to the world
Do these sermons run in circles
Are they spoken by design
To erase the thoughts of insecurity
And maybe were just never meant to find
The answer to the question we've all kept inside
Give me something to believe in
Give me anything at all
Cause right now this world just feels like its too small

When the cold wind blows through weathered eyes 
And blistered skin 
It's quiet now 
It's like the calm before the raging violence of the storm begins 
And when this comes crashing down 
I'll fall harder than before 
I'll start this all over now

To cover up the past mistakes 
And hide behind a crying face of shame 
And how many nights will I hide 
And blink under the blackened skies

I'll beg for the ending or just for forgiveness 
I'll wait in the shadows of a battle I'm close to losing

If you stay will be old before you know 
And the shadow of the mid day sun burns beneath your feet 
And the old dogs are still sleeping in the street
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
I will come to you when you fall down
And when the lights go out and you set the world to rights
When I find you under Capricornia skies

You ask more questions than you answer
It pulls me out and I go with the tide,
And you turn my world on it’s axis 
Every time I look into your eyes

You say the things you love are the things you never had,
And when you hold them they pass through your hands like sand 
Well, I have made promises too that I could never hold 
And underneath the sun the parts of these histories fold
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
I will come to you when you fall down
And when the lights go out and you set the world to rights
When I find you under Capricornia skies",Capricornia,2012
Allo Darlin',"Heard you say ""They didn't put a man on the moon
We just needed someone to prove all this floating's worth doing""

Then why did you say that you miss a simpler time
Well so do I and I find myself pining for you

These days can a question be asked
When the hero comes in last
Who is winning?

Well I am tired of feeling confused
And lest my words be construed
I can't separate what's real, but I know that I believe in you

There you go, out on the pavement walking alone
They could name a star after you and you'd still be complaining

And now it's clear
Now that you know why I wanted you here
There's a southern constellation that shines with your name on it

And I won't fly until the day that I die
But we can't keep out dreams in jars so I'll keep yours close to mine

Well I am tired of feeling confused

Allo Darlin',"On a drive from solution to surface
In my old university car
We had the windows down for our recon
Though it was so hot that you burned your arm
It was the tail and over summer
And the heat washed in with the breeze
And you were searching something to sing to

As the radio played another terrible song
But lucky for me, you found the tape with Tallulah on
And it's been a long time
Since I've seen all my old friends
But I really love my new friends
I feel I've known them a long while

Then last summer you wrote me a letter
On the back of a surf magazine
You said you didn't have any paper
And maybe you wondered what could have been
So I sent you a postcard from Berlin of a fatman eating a sausage
And hear the fact that I was hiding

As the DJ played another terrible song
But lucky for us, we found a bar with the metals on
And it's been a long time
Since I've seen all my old friends
But I really love my new friends
I feel I've known them a long while

I'm wondering if I've already heard all the songs that'll mean something
And I'm wondering if I've already met all the people that'll mean something

But I find myself daydreaming of the places where we used to stay
Used to brush them away
Sinkilada, Cool and Gata on the beach and ?
Like the sound of their names

And I wonder if you would wanna go there with me
When I'm finished over here
If you're not finished with me",Tallulah,2012

30 to be icy

Still white and blue jeans

But it seems like just yesterday
When mama looked right in my face
And told me she was going away
If I could count all the tears that I crid
I'd be empty and lost inside
So I'll try to find a smile
And hold my head up high
Moma said
Don't cry
I'm going away Up high
Don't be afraid
Be strong
Just keep on holding on
Mama said
Don't cry
Dry all the tears
From your eyes
Don't be afraid
Be strong
Just keep on holding on
So young, but yet so wise
So much beauty was in her eyes
No one could quite explain
Just why she had to face the pain
But when the day comes and hits your time
Only God knows the reason why
She was my angel, my light, and my friend
But one day we'll be together again
But now that I know
She has gone away
Gone away, gone away
There were days when I wish that I could run away
Run away, run away
And if I could there would be another summer day
Summer day summer day
When I could see my mother's face again
Cause mama said
Don't cry
I'm goin away, way up high
Don't be afraid

Should I surrender when you pursue me
You think a man don't have heart and soul
When a hand's that good, anybody will fold
It's like poetry in motion
But the heart regulates the devotion
Love is floatin' in a sky blue ocean
Think about it
Feel the motion, young queen
It reminds me of a smoothed out movie scene
Two bodies intertwined on the screen
Everybody makes love in their dreams
But this is real, know what I mean
Passion is the way of the world
Electricity when boy meets girl
And making love is the key
A burning flame that will last eternally

I would give all I have just to be with you

Alma,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to ley you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
And they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everthing 
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love

À peine dans la pénombre
Comme un soleil qui sème des ombres
J'avoue, je l'ai pas vu venir
L'éclat de ton sourire
Dans son écrin, dans son écrin
Au début c'était tell'ment beau
Tu viens, tu portes mes fardeaux
Je me sens plus légère
Comme un prisonnier qu'on libère
À qui on redonne des printemps
À qui on vole ses hivers
Et qui espère, et qui espère

J'aurais dû quoi, passer mon chemin
Je suis réduite en cendres entre tes mains
Toi, t'appuies encore, tu ne vois rien
J'aurais dû quoi, m'en tenir aux faits
Au lieu d'rêver à des contes de fée
Plus je te serre fort, plus tu n'fais rien

La chute est lente, lente, lente, lente
Et tu me hantes, hantes, hantes, hantes
Et je revois tous les instants de toi
Dans mes nuits lentes, lentes, lentes, lentes
Rien ne chante, chante, chante
Depuis que ta voix
Chante trop loin de moi, loin de moi

Au début c'était du hasard
Quelques fois tu rentres un peu tard
Tu dis que je m'enflammes
Je ne dois pas en faire un drame
Il arrive qu'un élan du corps
Nous amène dans d'autres décors
Et ce n'est rien, non ce n'est rien

J'aurais dû quoi, passer mon chemin
Aller chercher de meilleurs lendemains
Sans le vouloir, tu me retiens
J'aurais dû quoi, m'en tenir aux faits
Tu as gagné, tiens voilà ton trophée
