Jimmie Lunceford,"Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me
I'm not the same as I used to be
This is my last affair

Tragedy just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start
You took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow, make a vow
No more to love's line will I bow
I cross my heart and feel it now
This is my last affair",(This Is) My Last Affair,2005
Jimmie Lunceford,"{Janet} Are you ready?
Free, free, baby,
Boy, when you look at me,
Do you judge me by my cover?
Got to be kiddin' me, to think that I'm that kind of lover

Open your eyes and see,
True love comes for free

{Luther}
I'm keepin' my heart open, and hopin' you won't stab me in it

While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me,

Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain",Stardust,1990
Jimmie Lunceford & His Orchestra,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain

But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

And the squirrels are so many you can't count them
Then I'll make love to some turtle dove

When the north winds blow and we're gonna have snow
And the rain and the hail comes bouncing
I'll wrap myself in a grizzly bear coat
Away out on the mountain

Where the snakes are vile and the zebras? wild
And the beavers paddle on walking canes
Then I'll send my boots with a buffalo hide
Away out on the mountain

Where the whippoorwills sing me to sleep at night
And the eagle roosts on the rocks of spontan
I'll feast on the meat and the honey so sweet

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Jimmy Barnes,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,1985

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Jimmy Bell,"As I was walking down the street last night
A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes.
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track,
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back,
So if you want to have fun in this man's land,
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands.""
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight,
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose,
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face,
While she went down to the powder place
With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
The music stopped and the lights came on,
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye

And mail it right away

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2007

Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home

Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper oh I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear

There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet

Oh she left me without mercy

And he smiles upon the faces
Who wish they could go far

And now they listen spellbound
With lumps caught in their throats

His vice was reading plays
While other children starved and fought
He learned just what to say
Through tension and confession
He beat the monster down

To love a man so rare

It's a hell of a time to be thinking about heaven
Didn't you forget the golden rule
You've been acting like Jesus owes you a favor

You remind them seek and you shall find
Maybe youth will have a time for seeking
After they clean up what you left behind

You were right there when the plate was passed last Sunday
That's the second time you've been to church all year
Could you really call yourself a Christian
If charity cost half as much as beer

You get religion as your hair turns gray
But you don't need to worry about hereafter
Just worry what you're going to do today

Jimmy Buffett,"I once knew a poet who lived before his time
He and his dog Spooner would listen as he'd rhyme
Words to make you happy and words to make you cry
And then one day the poet suddenly did die. 

But he left behind a closet filled with verse and rhymes
And through some strange transaction
One was printed in the Times
And everybody's searching for the king of underground
They found him down in Florida with a tombstone for a crown. 

And everybody knows a line from his books that cost $4.99
I wonder if he knows he's doin' quite this fine. 

'Cause his books are all best sellers and his poems were turned to song
They had his brother on a talk show though they never got along
And now he's called immortal, yes, he's even taught in school
They say he used his talents, a most proficient tool. 

But he left all of his royalties to Spooner his old hound
Growing old on steak and bacon in his doghouse ten feet 'round
And everybody wonders did he really lose his mind
No, he was just a poet who lived before his time

When we'd have to eat on Easter with my
Crazy old uncle and aunt.
They lived in a big house Ante Bellum style,
And the wind would blow across the old bayou,
And I was a tranquil little child. 

Life was just a tire swing.
'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing.
Blackberry pickin', eatin' fried chicken,
And I never knew a thing about pain.

Yeah, me and my cousin' Baxter
In our pup tent with a lamp.
And in a few days Baxter went home,
And he left me by myself.
And I knew that I'd stay, it was better that way,
And I could get along without any help.
Life was just a tire swing. 

And I've never been west of New Orleans
Nor east of Pensacola.
My only contact with the outside
World was a n RCA Victrola.
Elvis would sing and then I'd dream about
Expensive cars, and who would've figured twenty
Years later I'd be rubbing shoulders with the stars.
Life was just a tire swing. 

'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing.
Chasin' after sparrows with rubber tip arrows,
Knowin' I could never hurt a thing,
And life was just a tire swing.

I fell asleep at the wheel,
But was quickly wakened up by a 'Ma Bell'
Telephone pole, and a bunch of Grant Wood
Faces screaming, 'Is he still alive?'
But through the window could see
It hangin' from a tree, and I knew
I had survived.

I'm gonna teach him how to fuss,
Teach him how to cuss,

Yes, I own a whaler boat
It slides across the sea
Some folks say I'm part of it
And I know it's part of me 

And when I'm feelin' solitaire
It let's me be alone
And when I want to have a taste
It carries me back home 

And I'm somewhere below the sunlight
Somewhere upon the sea
You dig deep enough you might find me
Find me, cause that's where I'll be

Sold his Trailways bus

For the Labor Day weekend show,
I've got my hush-puppies on,
I guess I never was meant for
Glitter rock and roll.
And honey I didn't know
That I'd be missin' you so.

Come Monday It'll be all right,
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze
And I just want you back by my side.

Yes it's been quite a summer,
Rent-a-cars and west bound trains.
And now you're off on vacation,
Somethin' you tried to explain.
And darlin' I love you so that's
The reason I just let you go.

Come Monday It'll be all right,
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze
And I just want you back by my side.

I can't help it honey,
You're that much a part of me now.
Remember the night in Montana when
We said there'd be no room for doubt.

I hope you're enjoyin' the scenery,
I know that it's pretty up there.
We can go hikin on Tuesday,
With you I'd walk anywhere.
California has worn me quite thin,
I just can't wait to see you again.

Jimmy Buffett,"Well, like to explain to you all before,
I ain't no drinkin' man
I tried it once and it got me highly irregular
And I swore I'd never do it again
I promised my brother in-law that I'd go up watch his still

While he went in to town to vote
It was right up on the mountain 
Where the map said it would be
Friends let me tell you one thing,
Tho it wasn't no ordinary still
It stood up on that mountainside 
Like a hugh golden opal

God's yeller moon shinin' on the cool clear evenin'
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off in the heavens
Like I explain'd to you once before I ain't no drinkin' man
But temptation got the best of me
And I took a slash
That yella whiskey runnin' down my throat 
Like honey dew vine water
And I took another slash, 
Took another'n an another'n an another'n
For you knew I'd downed one whole jug of that shit
And commenced to gettin' hot flashes

Goose pimples was runnin' up and down my body
And a feelin' came over me 
Like somethin' I'd never experienced before
It was like, like I was in love

In love for the first time, with anything that moved
Animate, inanimate it didn't matter
It's like there's a great neon sign flashin' on an' off
In my brain sayin' ""Jimmy Buffett there's a great day a comin'""
'Cause I was drunk
I wasn't knee crawlin', slip slidin', Reggie Youngin'
Commode huggin' drunk
I was God's own drunk and a fearless man

And that's when I first saw the bear
He was a Kodiak lookin' fella 'bout nineteen feet tall
He rambled up over the hill 
Expectin' me to do one of two things,
Flip or fly, I didn't do either one
It hung him up

He started sniffin' around my body tryin' to smell fear
But he ain't gonna smell no fear 'cause
I'm God's own drunk and a fearless man
It hung him up

He looked right in my eyes, and my eyes 
Was a lot redder than his was
It hung him up

So I approached him, I said ""Mr. Bear, I love
Every hair on your twenty-seven acre body
I know you got a lot of friends over there
On the other side of the hill

There's ole' rare bear, tall bear, Freddy bear, Kelly bear
Really bear, smelly the bear, smokey the bear, 
Pokey the bear

I want you to go back over there tonight 
And tell them I'm feelin' right
You tell them I love each and everyone of them 
Like a brother and a sister

But if they give me any trouble tonight
I'm gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill""
He took two steps backwards and didn't know what to think
Neither did I but bein' charitable and cautious 
Well hell I approached him again

I said ""Mr. Bear, You know in the eyes of the Lord
We're both beasts when it comes right down to it
So I want you to be my buddy, Buddy bear""
So I took ole' buddy bear by his island size paw
And I led him over to the still
He's a sniffin' around that thing cause
He's smellin' somethin' good
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water
He downed it up right

Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus
Sippin' sasparilly in the moonlight
I gave him another'n an another'n an another'n
For I knew it he downed eight of them
And commenced to doin' the bear dance
Two snips, a snort, a fly turn, and a grunt
It was so simple like the jitter bug 
It plum evaded me

We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside
And I laid down and went to sleep
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams
When I woke up, there was God's yeller moon
Shinin' on the clear cool evenin'
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off
In the heavens

My buddy the bear was a missin'
Want to know something else friends and neighbors

Jimmy Buffett,"Years grow shorter, not longer,
The more you've been on your own.
Feelin's for movin' grow stronger'
So you wonder why you ever go home,
Wonder why you ever go home. 

People are movin' so quickly.
Humor's in need of repair.
Same occupations and same obligations;
They've really got nothing to share,
Like drivin' around with no spare. 

River gets deeper not shallow,
The further you move down the stream.
Wonderin'if I can keep her as I
Race to keep up with my dreams.
How they shine and glitter and gleam.

Time has come to lay my burden down

It's come from behind, 
Now is the time for the last line.

To climb upon his knee 
And listen to the many tales of life upon the sea

We'd go sailing back on barkentines 
We talk of things he did
Tomorrow just a day away for the captain and the kid

His world had gone from sailing ships 
To raking mom's back yard
He never could adjust to land 
Although He tried so hard

We both were growing older then
And Wiser with our years
That's when I came to understand
The course his heart still steers

He died about a month ago
While winter filled the air
And though I cried, I was so proud
To love a man so rare 

He's somewhere on the ocean now
That's where he ought to be
With one hand on the starboard rail
He's waving back at me

Jimmy Buffett,"He went to Paris
Looking for answers
To questions that bothered him so

He was impressive
Young and aggressive
Savin' the world on his own
But the warm summer breezes
The French wines and cheeses
Put his ambition at bay
His summers and winters
Scattered like splinters
And four to five years slipped away

Then he went to England
Played the piano
And married an actress named Kim
They had a fine life, she was a good wife
And bore him young son named Jim
And all of the answers, and all the questions
He locked in his attic one day
'Cause he liked the quiet
Clean country livin' and
Twenty more years slipped away

Well, the war took his baby
Bombs killed his lady
And left him with only one eye
His body was battered
His whole world was shattered
And all he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling and he was recalling
Answers he'd never found
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound

Now he lives in the islands
Fishes the pilings
And drinks his green label each day
Writing his memoirs
Losin' his hearin'
But he don't care what most people
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say,
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic
But I had a good life all of the way.""

Partied old Chi-town 'round

Rollin' along that Interstate 10

Lord knows we're Texas bound

We've been to L.A. too

But they don't boogie like the Bee Gees do

Jimmy Buffett,"They talk about the women too much
Women got 'em so confused
They don't talk about their lives as such

They take it with a grain of salt
And laugh at the complexities

They're good at pickin' all the faults
I keep laughin' so they don't pick me

And then I hear her say hello-hello
Panic in the gray room now

That seems to make me different from you

Well I tried to book passage, but you have no ports
And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters

Jimmy Buffett,"In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb
I didn't know what about but I was feeling quite disturbed
A street sweeper came whistlin' by
He was bouncin' every step
It seemed strange how good he felt
So I asked him while he swept

He said ""It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
And that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the rest
And that makes the day for me""

Got an uncle who owns a bank he's a self made millionaire
He never had anyone to love never had no one to care
He always to seemed kind of sad to me
So I asked him why that was
And he told me it's because in my contract there's a clause
That says ""It's my job to worried half to death
And that's the thing people respect in me
It's a job but without it I'd be less
Than what I expect from me""

I've been lazy most all of my life
Writing songs and sleeping late
Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake
If street sweepers can smile then
I've got no right to feel upset
But sometimes I still forget
Till the lights go on and the stage is set
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat

It's my job to be different than the rest
and that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the best
and that's a tough break for me

The cheating was sweet but my heart is beat
Don't tear it apart
Please bypass this heart

My heart was young and strong and worked just fine
But now you've shown me there's a hurting side of feeling
There's just one cure and here's what you must do

And if I had the money, honey
I'd strap you in beside me
And never ever leave you
Leave you at home all alone and cryin'

No need
My pickup gets me where I please
Chuggin' down the street

In a little while
So close your eyes and I'll
I'll be back real soon

Jimmy Buffett,"He went to Paris
Looking for answers
To questions that bothered him so

He was impressive
Young and aggressive
Savin' the world on his own
But the warm summer breezes
The French wines and cheeses
Put his ambition at bay
His summers and winters
Scattered like splinters
And four to five years slipped away

Then he went to England
Played the piano
And married an actress named Kim
They had a fine life, she was a good wife
And bore him young son named Jim
And all of the answers, and all the questions
He locked in his attic one day
'Cause he liked the quiet
Clean country livin' and
Twenty more years slipped away

Well, the war took his baby
Bombs killed his lady
And left him with only one eye
His body was battered
His whole world was shattered
And all he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling and he was recalling
Answers he'd never found
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound

Now he lives in the islands
Fishes the pilings
And drinks his green label each day
Writing his memoirs
Losin' his hearin'
But he don't care what most people
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say,
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic
But I had a good life all of the way.""

And he went to Paris
Lookin' for answers to questions
That bothered him so",He Went to Paris,1985

To make it out in Hollywood
You just have to change and complain.""

I sold maps of the stars

Free fallin'
Just don't get in my way
Don't squish me

'Til they're shooting one another just pass the time 
And we live it appears 
Both in spite and in fear of the city

I was constantly told 
How our lives were controlled by the city 
How they keep us in debt 
With the trends that they set it's a pity 

Now the beautiful people in the magazines 
Got the normal ones living beyond their means 
And the things that they said 
Made me go in my head to the city

When I finally came 
There's some things still the same in the city 
You still lie under the thumb 
Of the rich and the young and the pretty

The doggies were yellin;, the children were bitin'
Frank and Lola tryin'to get together again 

So he took her to this movie called ""Body Heat""
She said, ""The Junior Mints were mushy and the sex was neat.
Oh my, Frankie weren't we better than that before our spat.""
Frankie told Lola, ""Honey, can't you see that I'll jump start you if
you'll kick start me.""
Frankie and Lola, tryin' to get together again. 

So they strolled along the highway, they walked along the beach
They stopped at several raw bars where they slurped a dozen each
Bought a bunch of popcorn from the fat man on the dock
Baby, turn back the pages, turn round the clock. 

Lola told Frank, ""Time we put it to the test.""
After Frankie told Lola she was stil the best
They fell asleep in the sand underneath the Florida moon in June.
Lola counted rainbows, Frankie counted sheep
Til they almost got run over by the lieguards' jeep
Frank and Lola tryin' to get together again.

They don't have names
And none of the streets here look the same
And there are so many quiet places
And smilin' eyes match the smilin' faces.

Yes, I have found me a home
And you can have the rest of everything I own
'Cause I have found me a home.

To the bars and the beaches of my town
And there aren't many reasons I would leave
Yes, I have found me some peace. 

And the ladies aren't demanding there
They never ask too much
And when you're coming off a cold love
That's sure a nice warm touch.

Thunder rolls like a bass drum note

Hangin' 'round here till the Judgment Day

Take me back to days full of monkeyshines
Bouncin' on a bubble full of trouble in the summer sun

Keep your raft from the riverboat
Fiction over fact always has my vote
And wrinkles only go where the smiles have been

But the question's still what are we doin' here
I don't think the answer's close at hand

Survivor with no livelihood
That you could ever make it good

Boarded in Marseilles
An angel full of tenderness
She gave her heart away
She was but a gypsy
He was just a stray
They almost made a miracle but it slowly slipped away
So he follows the equator
With a wish to run aground
It's a very vicious circle
Goin' round and round and round
And he watches from the fantail
As the mainland disappears
Just like the Flying Dutchman
He's a prisoner of his fears

And then realized it was still dark outside.
It was a light coming down from the sky.

Gonzo: Must be those strangers that come every night,
Whose saucer shaped light, put people uptight.
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark.
I hope they get home alright.

Jimmy Buffett,"Scales and clocks just can't be trusted
Keys and locks are destined to be busted
Metaphors were never made for keeping score
And I'm feeling for the sound of time 

Is it the answer or just a suggestion
Is love what we truly want or merely a protection
Is this music made to last or crumble like a shell
Is there heaven here on earth or is this really hell? 

(Chorus):
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
Only time will tell, is there a message in this song?
Will it eve make sense, will it ever ring a bell?
Only time will tell. 

Are we destined to be ruled by a bunch of old white men
Who compare the world to football and are programmed to defend
I'd like to try a princess or a non-terrestrial
Who is neither boat nor bashful
Is there really such a girl

Climb too fast and shove too hard
You'll be pushin' up the daisies in the old bone yard
Ah,...ah, ah,...ah

Bundled up half-frozen munchin' Milky Way-as
Found a shaman in a diaper with a poppy pot

Minor rap breakdown bridge
Out in Hollywood, the paper money rolls
They feed their egos, instead of their souls
A million here, a million there, a mindless corporate dance
Get paid for fuckin' off, in the south of France
They don't do the shows, but they act like the stars
They fly around in G4's and suck on big cigars
It ain't about the talent, it ain't about the skill
It's all about the silly stupid horseshit deal

They say he learned to be cowboy
They say he learned to rope and ride

Thinks about the tears his woman cried

Now Holly, won't you let me
Try and make you smile?
You loved him as if he were your husband
Now he'll be gone a while

Wrote he had to see the country
On starry nights he wish that you were there
And so it shows wherever he goes
Deep inside you know he really cares

And you know it will. And you know it will.

You understand just why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But its as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day

And I'm heading all the way, my dreams are dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a-flying
She is all I have left and music is her name

He's sending them off to himself
He gets them a couple days later

And carve up a good hunk of wood
Remembering to check on the sausage
He's got cooking somewhere look good

You'll get less competition from the clock upon the wall

Play me a serenade, a simple masquerade

But the last man standing

You make the same mistakes you did when you were young
Contending for the ladies' favors
Tasting every single flavor
While hopelessly trying not to scald your tongue

When I contemplated retiring for a while
But a hundred years from now
They'll still be asking how
As they gaze upon my taxidermic smile

Want to be the last man standing
Got the devil at the crossroads, wolf at the door

A puff of wind can break the spell
And all the golden threads are frail as spider webs

With her perfect weather curl
Is talking cold, cold, cold

You can't get out of bed
You can't remember what you've said
You're feeling old, old, old

Is it anger or depression
Fever or aggression
What's your remedy?

We're not talking rocket science
The answer to your question's very plain to see

You need a holiday, take a holiday
Find a far off wonderland
Where you take command of your own life today

Take a holiday, you need a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Hoist your sail and wind up on some moonlit bay

You're caught up in the Internet
You think it's such a great asset
But you're wrong, wrong, wrong

All that fiber optic gear
Can't replace your fears
Like an island song

Stop worrying about confession
Or making your impressions
On that corporate climb

It might come as quite a shock
But you can't really own that rock
It's just a waste of time

So take a holiday, you need a holiday
Find a far off wonderland
Where you take command of your own life this way

You need a holiday, take a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Hoist your sail and wind up on some moonlit bay

Well, it's only up to you
No one else can help you to
Go out and have some fun

And if you want to stay alive
And avoid the big nose dive
Be a comedian

So take a holiday, you need a holiday
Get yourself down off that shelf
Find a place to find yourself, quit acting so blase

Take a holiday, you need a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Wind up in the moon, it's a moonlit bay

Take a holiday, you need a holiday
Grab a pack and hit the trail
Hoist your sail and wind up on some moonlit bay

Sun's up, uh huh, looks okay

The world survives into another day

And I'm thinking about eternity

Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


I had another dream about lions at the door

They weren't half as frightening as they were before

But I'm thinking about eternity

Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


Walls windows trees, waves coming through

You be in me and I'll be in you

Together in eternity

Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


Up among the firs where it smells so sweet

Or down in the valley where the river used to be

I got my mind on eternity

Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


And I'm wondering where the lions are...

I'm wondering where the lions are...


Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake

Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take

Pointing a finger at eternity

I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy


Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun,

Polished as precise like the brain behind the gun

(Should be!) they got me thinking about eternity

Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


And I'm wondering where the lions are...

I'm wondering where the lions are...


Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay

One of these days we're going to sail away,

Going to sail into eternity

Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


And I'm wondering where the lions are...

I'm wondering where the lions are...

He said I ate the last mango in Paris
Took the last plane out of Saigon
Took the first fast boat to China
And Jimmy there's still so much to be done

With a pistol in each hand
She always kept me covered
As we moved from land to land

I had a damn good run on Wall Street
With my high fashion model wife
I woke up dry beneath the African sky
Just me and my Swiss Army knife

I ate the last mango in Paris
Took the last plane out of Saigon
Took the first fast boat to China
And Jimmy there's still so much to be done

As the sun fell from the skies
And like the sun he disappeared
Before my very eyes

It was somewhere past dark-thirty

Jimmy Buffett,"Hey, have you noticed that the world has changed
That the news is all bad
Well, I think it's time for a song about that

Up on the East side of Manhattan,
They're still dancing with the stars.
While over in sub prime city,
It's getting ugly in the local bars
Watching the news only gives me the blues
There's too much going wrong.
It takes the likes of me to hit the reboot key
And write a high speed drinking song.

Millionaires losing everything.
Hey, welcome to the other side of life!
There goes the yacht, there goes the Rolls,
But you, you get to keep your wife!
And don't forget the automakers
Swimming up stream like a trout.
They let the shit hit the fan
And then they made a plan
We've got a, a lot to drink about.

There's the price of oil,
The war of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a, a lot to drink about.

Now, Madoff made off with all the money.
And his clients are down to skunk weed.
Repeat after me, it's so easy to see
We're only talking simple greed.
And those Somalian pirates are counting all the gold.
While Bush and Cheney ain't around
And all the good lookers seem to be Russian hookers
From Key West to London town.

With the price of oil,
The war of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a, a lot to drink about.

So pour me some Tennessee whiskey,
Pour me a fine Jamaican rum.
That loud mouth soup
Can get ya kinda looped
Tequila, of course I'll have some!

Well the family devalues
And little children plan their net worth
And the truth wherever it's hiding,
Can be found on Google Earth.
Citibank's buying jets with our money.
I wanna flog 'em with a buggy whip.
Let's hope Obama and Joe won't let the volcano blow
And patch the hole in our sinking ship.

So I asked him while he swept

It's my job to be better than the rest
And that makes the day for me""

He never had anyone to love never had no one to care

That says ""It's my job to worried half to death
And that's the thing people respect in me
It's a job but without it I'd be less
Than what I expect from me""

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,

'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,

Jimmy C. Newman,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

To touch their harps of gold

My heart's calculatin'
My true love will be waitin'
Be waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em on, head 'em up
Head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Ride 'em in, cut 'em out
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide

Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Rollin' rollin' rollin'

Jimmy Carroll Orchestra,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me

I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting?
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me",Harbor Lights,
Jimmy Carroll Orchestra,"(Go . . . go . . . go)

Oh, let me go
Let me go
Let me go, lover
Let me be
Set me free
From your spell

You made me weep
Cut me deep
I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed 
From the first 
Day I fell

You don't want me
But you want me
To go on wanting you
Now I pray that
You will say that
We're through

Please turn me loose
What's the use?
Let me go, lover
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Jimmy Carroll Orchestra,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2011
Jimmy Carroll Orchestra,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,2011
Jimmy Carter,"I went down in the valley one day
I heard the angels singing
I heard a voice, I saw no one
I heard the angels singing
What you reckon the angels said
I heard the angels singing
Your sins is forgiven and your soul is free
I heard the angels singing
I went down in the valley one day
I heard the angels singing to me
I seen an old devil walk down my way
I heard the angels singing
What you reckon the devil said
I heard the angels singing
He said that heaven's door is closed, go home don't pray
But I heard the angels singing
I said get back sit down, get out of my way
I heard the angels singing
I don't wanna hear another word you say
Oh I heard the angels singing
Oh yes, I heard the angels singing
Just when I thought my soul was lost
I heard the angels singing
My dungeon was shook, my chains dropped off
I heard them singing
The people come running, saying what's it all about
I heard the angels singing
The holy ghost hit me, I could not help but shout
I heard the angels singing
When I went down in the valley one day
I heard the angels singing to me
I seen an old devil walk down my way
I heard the angels singing
I said get back sit down, get out of my way
I heard the angels
I don't wanna hear another word you say
Woo! I heard 'em singing
In that great getting up morning
I heard the angels singing to me
In that great getting up morning and I, whoo!
You know I heard the angels, hallelujah!",I Heard the Angels Singin',2014
