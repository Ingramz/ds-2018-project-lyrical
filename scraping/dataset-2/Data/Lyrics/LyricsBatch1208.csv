Tom Rush,"There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain
All these places have their meanings
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love of something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more",In My Life,2012
Tom Russell,"You don't put beans in chilli
You never water good whiskey down
And never play poker with a man named 'Doc'
On the Spanish side of town

And if you want to go peekin' at the doctor's daughter
You better pay the old man his bread
Then it's a short, short ride from hell to heaven
Ridin' on a bowl of red

I'm talkin' about sweet Lorene, the chilli queen
Down at number nine Pecos Street
She's got bull meat hangin' up above her head
And chilli peppers down at her feet

She's got an iron pot smokin' on a woodsmoke stove
Near an antique feather bed
Where it's a short, short ride from hell to heaven
Ridin' on a bowl of red

Here's the recipe,
Bull meat, crab meat, pig's feet, chicken feet
I've even seen her use a rabbit's head
Cemino, oregano, celanto, let it go
Then sop it up with sourdough bread

Let it boil one day, you'll be rollin' in the hay
Lorene keeps a man well fed
Just walk on down to number nine
Say, ""Gimme a little bowl of red""

Peter Piper picked a bunch of chilli peppers
Tell me how many packs did Peter Piper pick
Then he took 'em on down to sweet Lorene
Said, ""I need a bowl of red real quick""

She put Peter Piper's peppers in a pot on the stove
She put Peter Piper in her feather bed
And now Peter Piper's pickin' peppers all day
Just to get his daily bowl of red",A Bowl of Red,1984
Tom Russell,"In the hills of Montana
There's a timber wolf howlin'
The rangers are prowlin'
For a woman alone
She'd run away from an Indian lover
He'll never recover
She turned him to stone

[Chorus]
She drank Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
She drank it like wine
Her eyes were the color of Canadian whiskey
Pure blended whiskey
So light brown and fine

Twenty years later
I heard of a woman
She's living alone
Up by Yellowstone Creek
And old Trapper John
Brings her cases of whiskey
Canadian whiskey
He says she never will speak

[Chorus: x2]",Canadian Whisky,1984
Tom Russell,"In a land the Spanish once had called the Northern Mystery, 
Where rivers run and disappear the mustang still is free.
By the Devil's wash and coyote hole in the wild Owyhee Range
Somewhere in the sage tonight the wind calls out his name.
Aye, aye, aye.

Come gather 'round me buckaroos and a story I will tell
Of the fugitive Claude Dallas who just broke out of jail.
You might think this tale is history from before the West was won, 
But the events that I'll describe took place in nineteen eighty-one.

He was born out in Virginia, left home when school was through;
In the deserts of Nevada he became a buckaroo, 
And he learned the ways of cattle, and he learned to sit a horse, 
And he always packed a pistol, and he practiced deadly force.

Then Claude he became a trapper, and he dreamed of the bygone days, 
And he studied bobcat logic and their wild and silent ways
In the bloody runs near Paradise, in monitors down south
Trapping cats and coyotes, living hand to mouth.
Aye, aye, aye.

Then Claude took to livin' all alone out many miles from town, 
A friend Jim Stevens--brought supplies and he stayed to hang around.
That day two wardens Pogue and Elms rode into check Claude out, 
They were seeking violations and to see what Claude's about.

Now Claude had hung some venison, he had a bobcat pelt or two;
Pogue claimed they were out of season, he said ""Dallas, you're all thru.""
But Dallas would not leave his camp. He refused to go to town.
As the wind howled throught the bull-camp they stared each other down.

Its hard to say what happend next, perhaps we'll never know, 
They were gonna take Claude in to jail, and he vowed he'd never go.
Jim Stevens heard the gunfire, and when he turned around
Bill Pogue was falling backwards, Conley Elms he fell face down.
Aye, aye, aye.

Jim stevens walked on over;there was a gun near Bill Pogue's hand.
It was hard to say who drawn his first, but Claude had made his stand.
Claude said ""I am justified Jim, they were gonna cut me down, 
And a man's got a right to hang some meat
When he's livin' this far from town.""

It took eighteen men and fifteen months to finally run Claude down.
In the sage outside of Paradise they drove him to the ground.
Convicted up in Idaho manslaughter by decree
Thirty years at maximum, but soon Claude would break free.

There's two sides two this story, there may be no right or wrong, 
The lawman and the renegade have graced a thousand songs.
The story is an old one. Conclusion's hard to draw, 
But Claude's out in the sage tonight he may be the last outlaw.
Aye, aye, aye.

In a land the Spanish once had called the Northern Mystery, 
Where rivers run and disappear the mustang still is free.
By the Devil's wash and the coyote hole in the wild Owyhee Range
Somewhere in the sage tonight the wind calls out his name.
Aye, aye, aye",Claude Dallas,1991
Tom Russell,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",Gallo del Cielo,1991
Tom Russell,"Rayburn Crane he rode these mountains like the streams he rode 'em through 
Through the Farewell Gap and the Franklin Lakes 
Up North to Chagupa Plateau 
With the government men and the hunters and the dudes 
And the leaders of the business world 
Yea, Rayburn Crane was a packhorse man 
And a mighty good hand with a mule.

Rayburn Crane, Rayburn Crane 
The Mountains and the 
Valleys and the Trees Remember your name.

He rode 45 years through the mountains 
And the valleys just a-pullin' them strings of mules 
And the ropes and the chaps and the halters 
And the saddles well these were 
Rayburn's tools Sittin' down at night by the firelight 
Talkin' and a-pullin' at the whiskers on his chin 
You didn't need no music when 
Rayburn went to talkin' 'bout the mountains and the packhorse men.

Rayburn Crane, Rayburn Crane 
The Mountains and the 
Valleys and the Trees Remember your name.

Well the business men they bought these mountains for a big time ski resort 
An Ol' Rayburn he's gone down to die in a 
Three Rivers' trailer court 
And the canvas-flapjack-cooktent moans with the bushes and the trees in the wind 
'Cause there ain't no place in a ski resort for a mule skinnin' packhorse man.

Tom Russell,"Well the Mezcal is free in Amanda's saloon 
For the boys from the old Broken O
Saturday nights in the town of Sonora 
Are the best in all Mexico
They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas 
Who won't want to let you go
You'd never believe such a gay happy town 
Had a street named Sonora's Death Row  

Well inside Amanda's we were all dancin' 
With all of Amanda's gals
I won some silver at seven card stud 
So I was outdoin' my pals
But the whiskey and mezcal and peso cigars 
Drove me outside for some air
Where somebody whispered ""Your life or your money"" 
I reached but my gun wasn't there  

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley
Aware of the fool I had been
I rushed to my pony, I grabbed my Winchester 
And I entered Amanda's Again
Where I saw my partners twirlin' my pistols 
And throwin' my money Around
Blinded by rage, I pulled the trigger 
And one of them fell to the ground  

Well Amanda's grew silent like night in the desert
My friends stared in pure disbelief
Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy 
Plainly expressing her grief
And as I bowed my head, a tremble shot through me
My six-gun was there at my side
I felt in my pockets and there was my money
I fell to my knees and I cried  

For a nightmare of mezcal was all that it was 
No one had robbed me at all
I wish I was dreamin' the sound of the gallows 
They're testin' just outside the walls
And the mezcal's still free in Amanda's saloon 
For the boys from the old Broken O
And I'd give a ransom to drink there today 
And be free of Sonora's Death Row 
Yeah I'd give a ransom to drink there today 
And be free of Sonora's Death Row",Sonora's Death Row,1991
Tom Russell,"Old man on the corner, singin' my life 
Playin' guitar with a rusty old knife 
And every line that he's singin' rhymes with the truth 
And a promise of something, beyond the blues

You and me, darling, took the long way around 
Through the wide open countries and the heart attack towns 
To every fork in the road, where we've all got to choose 
Between darkness and light out beyond the blues

Beyond the shadows, beyond the rain 
Beyond the darkness and all the pain 
When you're walkin' in circles with holes in your shoes 
Love is the road that leads beyond the blues

Old man on the corner, he's been gone for years 
And the guitar and the knife blade are rusty with tears 
But there's a song that he left us, we'll never lose 
That love is the road that leads beyond the blues",Beyond the Blues,1991
Tom Russell,"Have you seen Miranda? 
She's walking through the town 
She has got one green eye, the other eye is brown 
And as she walks the air grows warm, men stare down from rooms 
She destroys the hidden line between the wise man and the fool

She's a black pearl, she's a black pearl, 
She's a black pearl, she's not my girl

They say down in Tango town, the accordion is king 
Where Astor Piazzola plays on the Bandoneon 
And outside 'neath an olive tree the dust and sand it whirls 
She tangos with the moonlight, that dangerous Black Pearl

She's a black pearl, she's a black pearl, 
She's a black pearl
She's not my girl

Don't talk to me of politics, don't talk to me of war 
For I have seen her secret things 
Upon the shower door I've seen presidents corrupted, 
I've seen kings down on their knees Hehe, 
It wasn't revolution, lust was the disease

For some Black Pearl",Black Pearl,1991
Tom Russell,"Well, she moves like Betty Grable 
She's an actress waitin' tables 
And all her tips are kept inside a wishin' well 
She's got an agent down the hall 
He's got her photo on his wall 
She's got a room at the Evangeline Hotel

And from the tenth floor fire escape 
She can see the Great White Way
But not the street and not the eyes of those who fell 
She dreams she sees her name in lights 
She dreams that dream every night 
Room 10-04 at the Evangeline Hotel

It's ""Rock of Ages cleft for thee"" 
She's just a child of Tennessee 
Her daddy's girl, her golden curls locked in a spell 
Where you don't play your music loud 
And there ain't no men allowed 
On Friday nights at the Evangeline Hotel

You make it here, so they declare 
Then you can make it anywhere 
Those old cliches ring through the hall just like a bell 
But tell it to the ones who wait 
Behind the 23rd street gate 
On Friday nights at the Evangeline Hotel

It's ""Rock of Ages cleft for thee"" 
She's goin' back to Tennessee 
She's got a watch and winter coat that she can sell 
She learned the hard unspoken rules 
And things you'll never learn in school 
All down the halls of the Evangeline Hotel

And you can knock on any door 
Any room on every floor 
It's all the same at the Evangeline Hotel 
The House of Dreams called the Evangeline Hotel",The Evangeline Hotel,1991
Tom Russell,"""Do you know who I am?"" said Bill Haley 
In a pancake house down near the Rio Grande 
Well the waitress said, ""I don't know you from diddley
To me you look like one more tired old man""

Well he walked all alone down on Main street 
Was a hot wind blowin' up from the south 
There were two eye's starin' in a pawnshop window 
A whiskey bottle lifted to his mouth

There was no moon shinin' on the Rio Grande 
A truck of migrants pulled through town 
The jukebox was busted at the bus depot 
When Haley's comet hit the ground

Well he blacked out all the windows in his bedroom 
He was talkin' to the ceiling and the walls 
Then he closed his eyes and hit the stage in 1955 
And the screams of the women filled the hall

There was no moon shinin' on the Rio Grande 
A truck of migrants pulled through town 
The jukebox was busted at the bus depot 
When Haley's comet hit the ground

Well a cop walks in a pancake house in Texas 
And he orders up two coffees to go 
He tells the waitress, ""Baby, we just found the body
Of someone who was famous long ago.""

Tom Russell,"How's the weather in Winnipeg? 
The broke-down nags with the bandaged legs 
At Assinboa Downs? 
The night we painted the town A dark, dark blue 
Stolen Thunder in Thunder Bay 
Woke up knowin' that we came the wrong way 
So we turned it all around 
To the cold hard sound 
To the turnin' of the gears 
To the blood hard sound 
The turnin' of the years

I was thinkin' of you last night 
North of the border in the Northern Lights 
One horse town with the Indian name 
And all the gentle words 
I could never say 
Love shines in the night 
In the morning it's gone away

Cup of coffee in old Moose Jaw 
Used to be the hideout of a bad outlaw 
Named Al Capone His fedora on 
Walkin' in the snow 
We headed west, then it all broke up 
Skull-Smashed-In-Buffalo-Jump 
Rockin' and a reelin' 
That old buffalo feelin' 
Of fallin' through the air 
And never really knowin' how the hell 
We ended up there

I was thinkin' of you last night 
North of the border in the Northern Lights 
One horse town with the Indian name 
And all the gentle words 
I could never say 
Love shines in the night 
In the morning it's gone away

How's the weather in Winnipeg? 
When the ice melts 
On the first of May 
On those desolate streets 
One old Sikh 
In a powder blue cab 
Is there an Indian name 
For the love and trouble we had?

Tom Russell,"He had a vision of Anne Marie
With a rosary in her hand
So it's exit the rainmaker
The old gray flannel man
With a closet full of business suits
He left a letter near the phone
It said, ""I'm on my way to paradise
To see the angel of lyon""

And then he caught the train to Brussels
He ordered cognac and croissants
He made a mental list
Of things he owned but didn't want
All the buildings, all the real estate
The antique glass and stone
He'd trade a vow of poverty
To see the angel of Lyon

And he sang ave maria
Or at least the parts he knew
And watched the shadow of the train
On the towns that they rolled through
And he closed his eyes and he saw two rivers
The Rhone and the saone
The male and female spirit of
The city of Lyon

Then he waited on the bridge
Where they met the year before
But the days turned into weeks
And then the seasons numbered four
And his clothes grew worn and ragged
As through that town he roamed
Searching every open window
For the angel of Lyon

And he sang Ava maria
Or at least the parts he knew
And watched his shadow on the walls
Of the streets that he walked through
And he crossed those holy rivers
The Rhone and the saone
They'd not give up the secret of
The angel of Lyon

There's a thousand candles burning
In the basilica tonight
Where sister eve maria
Is the keeper of the light
And down a dream of alleyways
Walks a saint of rag and bone
The madman torn asunder
By the angel of lyon

And he sang ava maria
Or at least the parts he knew
And watched his shadow on the wall
Of the streets that he crawled through
And he crossed those holy rivers
The Rhone and the saone
But they'd not give up the secret of
The angel of Lyon",The Angel of Lyon,1992
Tom Russell,"He said my name is Nakashima
And I'm a proud American
I came here in '27
From my homeland of Japan

And we picked your grapes and oranges
Made some money, bought a store
Until 1942
Pearl Harbor and the war

Came those relocation orders
They took our house, the store, the car
Then they drove us to the desert
To a place called Manzanar

The Spanish word for ""apple orchard""
Though we saw no apple trees
Just the rows of prison barracks
And barbed wired boundaries

And we dream of apple blossoms
Waving free beneath the stars
Till we wake up in the desert
The prisoners of Manzanar
Manzanar

Fifty years, they've all but vanished
And now I am an old man
But I don't regret the day
That I came here from Japan

But on moonlit winter nights
I often wish upon a star
That I'd forget the shame and sorrow
That I felt at Manzanar

And we dream of apple blossoms
Waving free beneath the stars
Till we wake up in the desert
The prisoners of Manzanar

Tom Russell,"Edith Piaf was the Little Sparrow 
She flew high above the Paris streets 
Saint of the bars and bistros 
Chanteuse of a tear-stained sheet 
She sang for the drunks and the sailor boys 
Who'd sunk as low as low can get 
I read she kicked a three-pack habit once 
On chocolate cigarettes

And she didn't have a smoke 
Though she wanted one 
Didn't take a drink 
Though it hurt her some 
She stared across the 
River Seine hummin' 
""No Regrets"" Pullin' on a chocolate cigarette

Oh, those chocolate cigarettes I've seen 'em in my youth 
There beside the Hershey bars, 
The Almond Joys, the Baby Ruths 
I kicked a three-pack habit once I won a hundred dollar bet 
With the help of chewin' gum 
And

And I didn't have a smoke 
Though I wanted one I didn't take a drink 
Though it hurt me some I thought of 
Little Sparrow hummin' 
""No Regrets"" Pullin' on a chocolate cigarette

It's an Edith Piaf night tonight 
As I put her records on 
All that smoky passion 
In every line of every song 
Old love affairs and wasteful habits 
We'll all survive them yet 
Memories drown in coffee grounds 
And chocolate cigarettes

She didn't have a smoke 
Though she wanted one 
She didn't take a drink 
Though it hurt her some

Tom Russell,"He was born in 1890, on the Gulf of Mexico 
Fought his way around the world with hand, and heart, and soul 
So trot out all your Great White Hopes, 
But they'd better bring a gun 
Jack Johnson's made of iron he's all counter punch and run

Yonder comes Jack Johnson 
Like he owns the town 
There's a lot of white American's 
Like to see that man fall down 
Like to see a black man drown

Jack stood on the Titanic pier with a thousand dollar roll 
But the captain said, 
""Sorry, Boy, we ain't haulin' coal"" 
So Jack danced the Eagle Rock in a tavern on the shore 
While the captain danced his final dance on the Atlantic Ocean floor

Yonder comes Jack Johnson 
Like he owns the town 
There's a lot of white American's 
Like to see that man fall down 
Like to see a black man drown

Jack Johnson beat Jim Jeffries, till there weren't nothin' left 
And every time he'd throw a punch he'd say, 
""Package for Mr. Jeff!"" 
The he ran off with some white girl, man that made 'em mad 
All agreed and all decreed, that Black Man was bad

Tom Russell,"He had a blue wing tattooed on his shoulder
Well, it might have been a bluebird, I don't know
but he'd get stone drunk and talk about Alaska
The salmon boats and 45 below
Well, he got that blue wing up in Walla Walla
and his cellmate there was a Little Willy John
and Willie, he was once a great blues singer
so Wing & Willie wrote him up a song

(CHORUS)
They sang, it's dark in here, can't see the light
but I look at this blue wing when I close my eyes
and I fly away, beyond these walls
up above the clouds, where the rain don't fall
on a poor man's dreams
They paroled blue wing in August of 1963
He moved north, picking apples in the town of Wenatchee
And then winter finally caught him in a rundown trailer park
on the south side of Seattle where the days grow grey and dark
And he drank and he dreamt a vision of when the seven still ran free
and his father's fathers crossed that wide old Bering sea
and the land belonged to everyone, and there were old songs yet to sing
now, it's broken down to a cheap hotel and a tattooed prison wing
Now, it's dark in here... (repeat chorus)
Well, he drank his way to L.A., and that's where he died
and no one knew his Christian name, and there was no one there to cry
but I dreamt there was a funeral; a preacher and a cheap pine box
and halfway through the sermon blue wing began to talk
He said, it's dark in here... (repeat chorus)",Blue Wing,1994
Tom Russell,"Well it's two eggs up on whiskey toast 
Home fries on the side, 
You wash her down with the roadhouse coffee 
That burns up your inside, 
It's just a canyon, Colorado diner, 
A waitress I did love, 
We sat in the back 'neath an old stuffed bear, 
A worn out Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

Well, old Jack the boss, he left at six 
It was, 'Katie, bar the door'. 
She'd pull down that Navajo rug 
And we'd spread it across the floor, 
I saw lightning frame the sacred mountains 
The wooing of the turtle doves 
Just Iying next to Katie, 
On that old Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

Well, I saw old Jack about a year ago, 
Said the place burned to the ground, 
All he saved was an old bear tooth 
And Katie she left town, 
Well, Katie, got a souvenir too, 
Jack smiled as he spit out a big old plug, 
Well, you shoulda seen her coming through the smoke 
She was dragging that Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

So every time I cross the sacred mountains 
And lightning jumps above, 
It always takes me back in time 
To my long lost Katie love, 
You know everything keeps on a moving 
Everybody's on the go, 
Hey, you don't find things that last anymore 
Like a hand-woven Navajo.

Tell all of my friends in Dos Palos, I'm gone but I'll be circling back
Now I'm crossing the Chowchilia River
By the light of a ragged moonbeam
Lord I'll miss the Rose of San Joaquin

I'll miss the sun on the Sierra Nevadas, adobe moon on the rise
Shining down on my love in Madera, shining into her dark Spanish eyes
Oh she taught me those Mexican love songs
""Volver, Volver"" in my dreams
And I miss the Rose of San Joaquin
Caught somewhere between
The road and the Rose of San Joaquin

Oh her black hair fell on the blanket in the tall grass we with the dew
Making love through the night by the river
Oh Magdalene how my heart cries for you
Alone on this highway of darkness

Tom Russell,"Two men rode in from the south, a rainy autumn night
The Sky above and the mud below
They walked into the Deacon's bar, they were Mexican by sight
The sky above and the mud below
They threw a horsehair bridle down, we trade this for whiskey rounds
The Deacon slams a bottle down, the two men start to drinkin'

Their hair was long and black, tied up behind their ears
Their faces were identical, like one man beside a mirror
Then someone whispered that beats all, their wanted posters on the wall
Twin brothers name of Sandoval, horse thieves from Boquillas

Now the bridle and the belts they wore were braided gray and black
The color of a roan horse once belonged to Deacon Black
The fastest horse for miles around, he'd been stolen from the old fairground
A month ago outside of town we tracked and never found him

Now the Deacon was a preacher who had fallen hard from grace
He owned the bar and a string of quarter horses that he'd race
Yea, Deacon he could drink and curse, though he still quoted sacred verse
He was sheriff, judge; he owned the hearse, a man you did not anger

The sky above, the mud below, the wind and rain, the sleet and snow
Two horse thieves from Mexico drinkin' hard and singin'

One brother he spoke English, Deac inquires as to their work
The man says mister we braid horsehair bridles, ropes and quirts
Yea, that fine bridle we did make, a roan horse killed by leg-bone break
He's horsehair rope now; horse-meat steak, we cleaned him to the bone

Well these gentlemen they were ignorant or didn't know just where they were
The Deacon's face grew darker as he measured every word
You horsehair braidin' sons o' witches stole my claim to earthly riches
Someone go and dig a ditch, there may well be a hangin'

One brother reached inside his shirt searching for his gun
Too late, for Deac had whipped around his sawed off Remington
The twins, they raised their hands and sneered, Deac was grinnin' ear to ear
He says court's in session, hear ye hear, yours truly is presidin'

Well the trial commenced and ended quick they didn't have a hope
Deac says we'll cut your hair now boys and you can braid yourselves a rope
The Old Testament, it says somewhere eye for eye and hair for hair
Covet not thy neighbors mare, I believe it's Revelations

Now the fancy horsehair bridle, it hangs on Deacon's wall
Next to that wanted poster of the brothers Sandoval
And he twisted rope so shiny black, the artifact that broke their necks
Their craftsmanship he did respect, they shoulda stuck to braidin'

Where a drunk man lay sleepin' in a ragged old tram
And the lines on his face mark a life on the run
Is he somebody's husband, somebody's son?

Well every week the newspaper tells a story of rage
Where the victims lay scattered across the front page
And there's always some loner, on a spree with a gun
Is he somebody's husband, somebody's son?

From the death rows of prison to the soup kitchen door
Each soul is an equal in the eyes of the Lord
Though hatred consumes them, once they were loved
They were somebody's husband, somebody's son

Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon

You bury your dreams or you wish on a star
For an ocean line ticket back to where you were born
Away from these hard times and the acres of corn

Every now and again I take a small drink
From the blackberry brandy hidden under the sink
And I pull out that steam trunk and put on my gown
And I waltz through these cornfields 'til I fall to the ground

But dreams are just things that you keep in a trunk
'til the men are out workin' or you've gone a bit drunk
Then you unlock your dreams, but they're tattered and worn
So you stare out the window at the acres of corn

Just a big old room with a 'big old 'mirror

Bucking horse shadow through the purple sage
We'll ride forever our love won't age""

Tom Russell,"Down in the scrub oak country
To the southeast Texas Gulf
There used to ride a brakeman,
A brakeman double tough.
He worked the town of Kilgore,
And Long view twelve miles down,
And the travelers all said
Little East Texas Red
He was the meanest bull around.

If you rode by night or the broad daylight
In the wintery wind or the sun,
You would always see little East Texas Red
Just a sportin' his smooth-runnin' gun.
And the tale got switched down the stems and mains,
And everybody said
That the meanest bull
On them shiney irons
Was that little East Texas Red.

It was on a cold and a windy morn'
It was along towards nine or ten,
A couple of boys on the hunt of a job
They stood that blizzardy wind.
Hungry and cold they knocked on the doors
Of the workin' people around
For a piece of meat
And a carrot or spud just a boil of stew around.

East Texas Red come down the line
And he swung off that old number two.
He kicked their bucket over a bush
And he dumped out all of their stew.
The travelers said, ""Little East Texas Red,
You better get your business straight
Cause you're gonna ride
Your little black train just one year from today.""

Well Red he laughed and he climbed the bank
And he swung on the side of a wheeler,
The boys caught a tanker to Seminole
Then west to Amarillo.
They caught them a job of oil-field work
And followed a pipeline down.
It took them lots of places
Before that year
Had rolled around.

Then on a cold and windy day
They caught them a Gulf-bound train.
They shivered and shook with the dough in their clothes
To the scrub oak flats again,
With their warm suits of clothes and overcoats
They walked into a store.
They paid that man
For some meat and stuff
Just a boil of stew once more.

The ties they tracked down that cinder dump
And they come to the same old spot
Where East Texas Red just a year ago
Had dumped their last stew pot.
Well, the smoke of their fire went higher and higher
And Red come down the line.
With his head tucked low in the wintery wind
He waved old number nine.
He walked on down through the jungle yard
And he came to the same old spot
And there was the same two men again
Around that same stew pot.

Red went to his knee's and he hollered
""Please, don't pull your trigger on me.
I did not get my business straight.""
But he did not get his say.
A gun wheeled out of an overcoat
And it played that old one two,
And Red was dead when the other two men
Sat down to eat their stew.",East Texas Red,2004
Tom Russell,"The festival was over the boys were all plannin' for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts

He moved across the mirrored room
""Set it up for everyone"", he said
Then everyone commenced to do
What they were doin' before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
""Could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins?""
Then he moved into the corner face down like the Jack of Hearts

Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens she was hopin' for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were fillin' up the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowin' you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

Big Jim was no one's fool he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts

Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
""Sorry darlin' that I'm late"", but he didn't seem to hear
He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts

""I know I've seen that face before"", Big Jim was thinkin' to himself
""Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf""
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet
And the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

Lily was a princess she was fair skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do she had
That certain flash every time she smiled
She'd come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts

Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife
She had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide
Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazin' to the future riding on the Jack of Hearts

Lily washed her face took her dress off and buried it away
""Has your luck run out?"", she laughed at him
""Well I guess you must have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall there's a brand-new coat of paint
I'm glad to see you're still alive you're lookin' like a saint""
Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
""There's something funny going on"" he said ""I can just feel it in the air""
He went to get the hangin' judge but the hangin' judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

Lily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch
She forgot all about the man she couldn't stand
Who hounded her so much
""I've missed you so"" she said to him and he felt she was sincere
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts

No one knew the circumstance but they say
That it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standin' there ya couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts

Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe it's said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

The next day was hangin' day the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows she didn't even blink
The hangin' judge was sober he hadn't had a drink
The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts

The cabaret was empty now a sign said ""Closed for repair""
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinkin' 'bout her father who she very rarely saw
Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law
But most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts

",Old Blue,2004
Tom Russell,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night where the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rose's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on his back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out thru the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso, my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rose's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rose's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for, I feel
A deep burning pain in my side

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Although I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye",El Paso,2004
Tom Russell,"(Bob Dylan)

Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck.

Old Reilly's daughter got a message
That her father was goin' to hang.
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand.

When the judge he saw Reilly's daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Sayin', ""Gold will never free your father,
The price, my dear, is you instead.""

""Oh I'm as good as dead,"" cried Reilly,
""It's only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.
Get on your horse and ride away.""

""Oh father you will surely die
If I don't take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice.
For that reason I will have to stay.""

The gallows shadows shook the evening,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
In the night the grounds were groanin',
In the night the price was paid.

The next mornin' she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken.
She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin',
She saw her father's body broken.

These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him,
That two healers will not heal him,
That three eyes will not see him.

That four ears will not hear him,
That five walls will not hide him,
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.

Tom Russell Band,"I was always running scared it's true
I was always running back to you
Running never takes you home
You're running wild and all alone

And lost you pay the cost
You held my heart right in your hand
You always seemed to understand
I played it right I played it wrong

I played around with love too long
And love's a game that anyone can lose

Love breaks the rules
A kind man turns cruel
What begins a dream will end a lie
Love makes a fool of the wise

They whisper that she's leaving town
They say that I was cruel
They say I played the perfect fool
A fool who never learned the ways of love

And the men down at the Homestead Works
Are sharing one last meal
Sauerkraut and kielbasa, a dozen beers or more
A hundred years of pouring slab,
They're closing down the door
And this mill won't run no more.

There's silence in the valley, there's silence in the streets
There's silence every night here upon these cold white sheets
Were my wife stares out the window with a long and lonely stare
She says ""you kill yourself for 30 years but no one seems to care""

You made their railroads rails and bridges, you ran their driving wheels
And the towers of the Empire State are lined with Homestead Steel

Tom Russell Band,"He had a blue wing tattooed on his shoulder
Well, it might have been a bluebird, I don't know
but he'd get stone drunk and talk about Alaska
The salmon boats and 45 below
Well, he got that blue wing up in Walla Walla
and his cellmate there was a Little Willy John
and Willie, he was once a great blues singer
so Wing & Willie wrote him up a song

(CHORUS)
They sang, it's dark in here, can't see the light
but I look at this blue wing when I close my eyes
and I fly away, beyond these walls
up above the clouds, where the rain don't fall
on a poor man's dreams
They paroled blue wing in August of 1963
He moved north, picking apples in the town of Wenatchee
And then winter finally caught him in a rundown trailer park
on the south side of Seattle where the days grow grey and dark
And he drank and he dreamt a vision of when the seven still ran free
and his father's fathers crossed that wide old Bering sea
and the land belonged to everyone, and there were old songs yet to sing
now, it's broken down to a cheap hotel and a tattooed prison wing
Now, it's dark in here... (repeat chorus)
Well, he drank his way to L.A., and that's where he died
and no one knew his Christian name, and there was no one there to cry
but I dreamt there was a funeral; a preacher and a cheap pine box
and halfway through the sermon blue wing began to talk
He said, it's dark in here... (repeat chorus)",Blue Wing,1990
Tom Russell Band,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",Gallo del Cielo,1990

And all he'd saved was an old bear too

Tom Scott,"A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue and hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you coming my way

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home any more
So back to my room and there in the gloom
I cry tears of goodbye

Tom Scott,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2006

Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And then I'll learn to laugh like Pagliacci

Tom Scott,"Well there's too many windows in this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy and the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside, nobody living inside

Gonna pull in the shutters on this heart of mine
Roll up the carpets and pull in the blinds
And retreat to the chambers that I left behind
In hopes there's still may be love left to find, still may be love left to find

Seek inspiration in daily affairs
Now you soul is improper and requires repairs
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers, echoes of unanswered prayers

Well there's too many windows in this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy and the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside, nobody living inside

It's telling me it might be you

Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?

Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

Tom Scott & the L.A. Express,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge

And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

Tom Shear,"I lost myself in shapeless oceans
Whose depths concealed more than they showed
Beliefs obscured by mists around them
A legacy they'd been bestowed

Columns of ice paint awkward pictures
Distorted forms that once seemed real
Engulfed inside transparent textures
Billowing curtains as hard as steel

For all the noise filling the landscape
Whispers and cries with no reply
It's quiet here within these boundaries
And thoughts collect like pools of light

My eyes divide the sky
As sirens sound in heaven
My will brings down the moon
And shatters it to pieces

The silence grew inconsequential
The day became a paradigm
A thousand years, a hundred decades
An arbitrary slice of time

I found myself with no companion
Except the salty earth and sky
And suddenly there came my focus
The world around me clarified

My eyes divide the sky
As sirens sound in heaven
My will brings down the moon
And shatters it to pieces

And so I walked in isolation
Hoping solace would cross my path
Ignored the road that lay behind me
And stepped away from the aftermath

I lost myself in shapeless oceans
Whose waters turned from dark to clear
I floated there, a tiny island
With no more doubt, with no more fear

My eyes divide the sky
As sirens sound in heaven
My will brings down the moon
And shatters it to pieces",Divide,2001

I must forge my own path
Overcome and surpass

If dreams were lightning thunder was desire

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.

And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

Tom Sheehan,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Now all around the world, in every iittle town
Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed",Nothing But a Child,2000

Keep on running away

I couldn't help myself from looking back
And it was then I saw her for the first time
Laughing and crying, living and dying

Think it would be right for you

For a moment in your life, believe
Heaven would decide for you

That a feeling deep inside will guide you

To a love you'll treasure it's you and I forever
Keep on believing

Tom Snow,"As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned

But you see everyday that we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams come undone
We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one

We are one
Family family
We are one

If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me
The way I am
Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part
Of some big land

Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun

Tears of pain tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride deep inside
We are one

We are one

We are one

We are one you and I

Down stream

Lay beside me, you lay
Beneath the thoughts you had of us
There's thick blood inside your room
I hope it finds and bring you back

A million reasons and a single nod
Feat of engineering sunlight give me all you've got

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Tom Stoppard,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. 

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way

That's the sharpest thing I've seen

Tom T. Hall,"[Chorus]
One hundred children, brave boys and girls
They come from nations all over the world
One hundred children marching along
One hundred children singing their song

Don't blow up the world, don't kill all the flowers
Today this is your world, tomorrow it's ours
Leave us pure water and forest uncut
Think of tomorrow, leave something for us

Your god may be dead but ours is alive
We think without him we cannot survive
Punish all the bad men, praise all the good
Talk to your neighbors about brotherhood

Tom T. Hall,"Well I met a man in Montgomery Alabama
I was waitin' on a bus and he was shinin' shoes and I heard him say
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land
A shoeshine man make you shine where you stand

Leave me a tip if you can I'm a shoeshine man

Tom T. Hall,"One time I spent a week inside a little country jail
And I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me
And said that I was speeding through their town

Well, they said,tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go.
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long

Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer

Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down

Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I'd get my release
Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please

Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw
He said, where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis? 
I'd like to talk to him about the law.
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be gettin' on my way
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him
He said, the judge'll be here any day.

The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away

The next mornin' that old judge took every nickel that I had
And he said, son, let this teach you not to race.

If you like a good breeze you can have all you please
If you don't get blown away in the fall

My money's all gone and my breeze died down my bloom of youth's gone to seed

Tom T. Hall,"There was a man came to see the USA from a foreign land
To photograph the progress of dear old Uncle Sam
He got off the boat in New York went down to the Bowery
I know what the man went to photograph and to see

There were hopeless hungry living dead
Winos who sell their souls for a bottle of a cheapest red
That's the picture that he wanted 
And that's what he got they say America the ugly today

He went to the Appalachians and he saw what we all have seen
Where people live on bread and soup fat back and pinto beans
He saw the hungry children and he photographed the ragged clothes
I guess we're gonna try to tell him that it ain't so

There were good men standin' around with nothing to do
Pregnant young women who didn't even have a pair of shoes
The man got his pictures and what are we going to say America the ugly today

Then he went to the medicare centers and he saw the old people there
It seems that the young generation just didn't want 'em in their hair
He saw the poor man workin' it out while the mighty rich lives high
And my friend that brings a gleam to the enemy's eyes

There were some folks had plenty and some had none at all

Tom T. Hall,"Now I'd hear a lot of tall stories since my business is writin' songs
And every now and then if you listen real close a good true one comes along
And this is the story of old Bill Crump from the North Carolina Hills
Nat Winston of Nashville knew this man real well
He built the church and he built the pews
He built the cradles and the furniture for the schools
Folks in Avery County say that he was better than good
Probably one of the reasons the Lord made wood
Now men have faults and Bill's fault was he loved to sip that corn
He lived ninety some years that way don't guess it was hurtin' him none
You could take him a picture from a catalog he could build anything he'd see
He could make anything that you could make out of the tree
One day Bill said Mama I'm gettin' old I want you to measure me good
I'm goin' out to that wood pile and get myself some wood
And I'm gonna make me a coffin I want it to fit me fine
The way I figure it I've got about enough time
He built the church and he built the pews...
Now Bill worked on that coffin like he was gonna be there awhile
He'd show the folks and rub that wood and then stand back and smile
He used that body for ninety some years figured it had treated him good
And when he left it he put it away in some real fine wood
Oh right now old Bill's sleepin' in the hills of North Caroline
In his homemade coffin hand rubbed walnut velvet lined
Now most folks use their heads and hands and just think of themselves
His body's there but his spirit's someplace else
'Cause he built the church and he built the pews...",Ballad of Bill Crump,1970

Tom T. Hall,"Me and Yates an army buddy o'mine were doin' three years in Germany at the time
We came upon these Frauleins in the bar
Yates said darf isch zee be-gleit-en they said ya
(And darf isch zee be-gleit-en means can we sit with you all)

Oh we must have drunk ten quarts of German beer
My conscience and my sinuses were clear
I asked that Fraulein if she was a spy she said nein but do bis ain bissel high

Well later on I went to be excused when I returned I was a bit confused
Yates and his Fraulein had hit the air another guy was sittin' in my chair
(A young soldier whom we shall get to know better)
I said excuse me Mister that's my seat I'd like to have it back sir if you please

That girl's a nurse and I've been awful sick the man looked up at me and said mox-nix
(Which means that he was not overly concerned with my health)
Next thing I knew he had a switchblade knife
Lord I didn't know that Fraulein was his wife

I took off through that Gasthaus like a fool behind me I heard the crashing stools
(As the police would say he was in hot pursuit)
Well the waitress yelled there's MPs on the way
That's one more reason I didn't want to stay

As I went out the window somethin' went switch
And I giggled all the way home knowin' he missed
(At the time it seemed like a laughing matter)
But next morning my coat was lyin' there on the bunk

And when I saw that coat it made me jump
That man had cut my coat right down the back
A little bit more and they'd been playin' me taps

Tom T. Hall,"The Iowa weather was 13 below 
I had come to Des Moines for a radio show 
I awoke in the evening from a traveler's sleep 
With notions of something to eat

The old elevator slid down past the floors 
My head and my eyes said ""You should have slept more."" 
The man at the desk said the restaurant was closed 
Outside it was 14 below

The lounge was still open and so I walked in 
In place of my food I had two double gins 
I looked 'round the room, as a tourist would do 
That's when I saw the girl in the booth

She sat there and cried in the smoky half-dark 
The silent type crying that tears out your heart 
Her clothes were not cut in the new modern way 
And her suitcase had seen better days

Nobody asked her what caused her such pain 
Nobody spoke up, yet no one complained 
Without even asking, I knew why she cried 
Life is just like that sometimes

The man at the desk said, ""It's 15 below."" 
The bellhop said ""Yeah man, that's cold...that's cold."" 
I went back to my room and I wrote down this song 
Oh it sure can get cold in Des Moines",It Sure Can Get Cold in Des Moines,1971

Tom T. Hall,"Oh, the little lady preacher from the limestone church
I'll never forget her, I guess
She preached each Sunday morning on the local radio
With a big black Bible and a snow-white dress 

She was 19 years of age and was developed to a fault
But I will admit she knew the Bible well
A little white lace hanky marked the text that she would use
She'd breathe into that microphone and send us all to hell 

She had a guitar picker by the name of Luther Short
A hairy-legged soul lost out in sin
She would turn and smile at Luther when the program would commence
With a voice as sweet as angels she would break out in a hymn 

I was picking for her too with what we call the doghouse bass
I clung to every word that passed her lips
She was down on booze and cigarettes and high on days to come
And she'd punctuate the prophecy with movements of her hips 

The Lord knows how I loved her, he was there each time she preached
But ol' Luther took her home each Sunday morn'
Looking back I still recall the way it hurt my tender pride
I longed to be a hero but they're made not born 

Sometimes ol' Luther showed up at the studio half-tight
And smoking was a thing he liked to do
She never said a word to him but said a prayer for me
I told her in a way that I'd been praying for her too 

One Sunday her old man showed up and said that she was gone
Said she and brother Luther had a call
I can see me standing in that studio that day
I had to face the heartbreak, unemployment and all 

I don't know where they are 'cause I ain't seen them people since
Lord if I judge 'em let me give 'em lots o' room
I know ol' Luther Short and he's a hard ol' boy to change
And I've often sat and wondered who it was converted whom",The Little Lady Preacher,1971
Tom T. Hall,"Yeah, I remember it now, we were kids back then livin' down on the farm
We were told that the city could only bring us harm
""How far is the city?"" somebody said, and ""oh, that's a great big town.""
Barbara said, ""why, it's a million miles,"" and the story got around

[Chorus:]
It's a million miles to the city
From the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city
And someday we all want to go

There was a town nearby, but a town is a town, and a city...well, that's
Something else
Our daddy had been to a city but he never was much help

""Why the buildings are taller than oak trees."" ah, but we knew better than that
Ain't nobody could climb that high, the cities were wide and flat

[Chorus]
Well now time has passed and we have grown and traveled far and wide
The cities have changed the kids we were, we see it in each others eyes
But I'd love to go back to those hills again, to the boy I used to be
Where the leaves and the wind and the whippoorwills were part of the land like me

Tom T. Hall,"Ramona lived just down the hill from us.
She kept the house ger mother drove the bus. (an old yellow school bus)
Ramona had a handicap the neighborhood knew well.
Ramona couldn't speak or couldn't spell. (and that left Ramona at a 

Considerable disadvantage among the more fluent)
Although she couldn't write or couldn't talk,
Ramona really had a pretty walk. (a four letter figure)
Because she couldn't write or speak nobody asked her out.

But ""bad-eye"" Thompson hung around the house. (he was what you'd call a 
Familiar figure in the neighborhood)
Well I guess their handicaps were common ground.
'Cause ""bad-eye"" Thompson always hung around.

He could squint that eye and spit tobacco thirty feet.
Ramona always grinned and stomped her feat.(because,to Ramona this was one of 
The finer things in life)
One day Ramona found herself with child.

She couldn't speak. Her mom was going wild.
Confusion reigned for half a day as one could understand.
The county judge came down to lend a hand. (and I think it should be noted in 
The interest of justice that the judge was acting in a strictly unofficial Capacity)

The neighbors gathered 'round Ramona's porch.
The judge said, ""Understand, this is not a court"".
Ramona squealed as all the breathless neighbors gathered 'round......

Tom T. Hall,"I was working in Miami for a day or two 
I decided I'd look up a girl that I once knew 
I bought some flowers and went to see a girl I used to know 
The lady at her door said she had married long ago
Times will change and towns will change; there I was alone 
And suddenly I wondered, ""Would Susie be at home?"" 
So with the flowers in my hand, I walked toward her gate 
Someone touched me on the arm and said, ""You'll have to wait."" 

Then I noticed there were people standing in a line 
And some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine 
They explained that Susie had been in an awful crash 
Doctors said that she had just a little while to last
When I walked into her room, I felt a sense of shame 
But I heard Susie whisper, ""I'm awfully glad you came."" 

She had been the girl that I had always gone to see 
When someone that I cared for had been untrue to me
I handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand 
She said, ""Don't be embarrassed; you know I understand."" 

I said, ""Goodbye"" and as I bent to kiss her fevered brow 
I heard her whisper, ""Thank you for the second handed flowers.""",Second Handed Flowers,1971
Tom T. Hall,"Tossed and turned the night before in some old motel
Subconsciously recallin' some old sinful thing I'd done
My buddy drove the car and those big coal trucks shook us up
As we drove on into Hyden in the early morning sun 

Past the hound dogs and some domineckered chickens
Temporary-lookin' houses with their lean and bashful kids
Every hundred yards a sign proclaimed that Christ was coming soon
And I thought, ""Well, man, he'd sure be disappointed if he did."" 

On the way we talked about the 40 miners
Of the 39 who died and one who lived to tell the tale
We stopped for beans and cornbread at the Ed & Lois Cafe
Then went to see the sherrif at the Leslie County Jail 

They took us to the scene of that disaster
I was so surprised to not find any sign of death at all
Just another country hillside with some mudholes and some junk
The mines were deadly silent like a rathole in the wall 

""It was just like being right inside of a shotgun.""
The old man coughed and lit a cigarette that he had rolled
Back in town I bought a heavy jacket from a store
It was sunny down in Hyden but somehow the town was cold

Who seemed refreshed despite the kind of work I knew he did
We talked about the pretty lady from the Grand Ole Opry
An' we talked about the money she was raisin' for the kids 

Well, I guess the old man thought we were reporters
He kept reminding me of how his simple name was spelled

It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around

I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee

Daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band

Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray

I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin` up the Lovesick Blues

When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I've been gettin' close to walkin' my one millionth mile

St Louis is famous for its shoes don't you know
Loafers and sneakers and they're makin' them all with soul

Tom T. Hall,"Chicago gets along so well without me though I'd go to Indiana for a while
The wind comes off the lakes so cold it freezes Chicago didn't try to make me smile
She told me that she was a Spanish gypsy
A black band round her neck to prove her race

She said she'd like to do some drinking with me
But the dishes were all dirty at her place
I'd like to know and understand your people but I can't meet 'em all you understand
All I really know about Chicago is what I learned from Windy City Anne

I guess she taught me some about Chicago
There were lines of discontent there in her face
For what she helped me know about Chicago I helped her do the dishes at her place
The sounds of old Chicago through the windows

I gathered up my thoughts to meet the day
I stayed and helped her dirty up the dishes rememberin' I found them all that way
I'd like to know and understand...

You came along and love laid a heavy hand on me
High steppin' proud man went down to his knees
For a while I enjoyed just bein' under your thumb
But after a while the nerve of love grew numb
Then I knew my heart was changing cryin' out long and loud
To once again become a man high steppin' proud

Beckon to your every wish and your every need
Oh I know it won't be long before I break those vows
And once again become a man high steppin' proud

Tom T. Hall,"I have been to New York City I have traveled there in style
It's a big convenient city but there ain't no country miles
I have put my hand inside the hands of men who could not see
What the singing of a bluebird means to me
I got that country cabin it is in my soul
It will comfort me in trouble be my friend when I am old
I have got to bring my country brothers back into the fold
I got that country cabin it is in my soul
Old wood burn stove fried chicken warm linoleum on the floor
Sunday preaching Monday cursing and the girl that lives next door
I have done some heavy thinking I have suffered with the load
Just like running barefoot down the gravel road
I got that country cabin it is in my soul...
I have known myself when others never knew me much at all
Sometimes it was the gettin' up that hurt more than the fall

Tom T. Hall,"Woke up on a bus and heard the driver say
Friends fill it up with No 2
Wondered where I was and wondered what today
Would be demanding me to do
It's not for me the last cause I'm just goin'
Where life's sendin' me I guess
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks 
In the last hard town we met

I sat pickin' on my guitar till I saw 
The new sun comin' through the skies
Ain't it funny how the truth is sometimes 
Written on an artificial high
Carry water from the well until you know 
That all the children are refreshed
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks 
In the last hard town we met

We were drinking too much yesterday 
Nobody's ever told us what's enough
The ones that we should've prayed for more than likely 
Were the ones we had to cuss
They applauded as we killed ourselves 
But angels don't have bourbon on their breath
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks 
In the last hard town we met

They came to see the people that they thought we were
And never changed their minds
They explained the way that difference caused 
The folks who love a picker can be blind
They misunderstood the words but understood 
That our intentions were the best
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks 
In the last hard town we met

What a picker does for others is the thing
He's mainly doing for himself
There were friends and there were neighbors
But the good homes that we came from didn't help

About us after we have gone to rest
We would like someone to mention all the good folks

That old tree ain't grown much more than six or seven feet
Lord I sometimes wish that I lived on this street
Looking forward to seeing you again I'm looking forward to seeing you again

And I'm looking forward to seeing you again
Oh I'm looking forward to seeing you again
I know I'm foolish when I think that life here never ends
The never changing smile of all my old familiar friends
But I suppose that death is just as real in Olive Hill as it is in some big city by a mill
I'm looking forward to seeing you again oh I'm looking forward to seeing you again
Remember all the times I've had to borrow fifteen bucks
How could I be so optimistic so down on my luck
You never mentioned that I had so many things to learn
And you never said it when my back was turned
And I'm looking forward to seeing you again my friend
I'm looking forward to seeing you again

Through the plain old Beer Drinker's Waltz.

Played an out of tune Yamaha guitar
Some old boy named Wink who brought his own drinks
Had his fiddle stoled out of his car.

Tom T. Hall,"We live on a farm in Tennessee
Like old McDonald's was
We have all the things that a farm should have
And a whole lot of love

We have a brace of ducks and a clutch of chicks
Cry of hounds and a candle of kits
Enough of frogs and as it gets dark
And an exaltation of larks

We live on a farm in Tennessee
Like old McDonald's was
We have all the things that a farm should have
And a whole lot of love

We have a drove of cattle and a grist of bees
A colony of ants and a gaggle of geese
A school of fish and a murder of crows
And a great big tribe of goats

We live on a farm in Tennessee
Like old McDonald's was
We have all the things that a farm should have
And a whole lot of love

We have a skulk of foxes and a sleuth of bears
A set of cranes and a hust of hares
A herd of horses and a spring of teal
And a watch of nightingales

We live on a farm in Tennessee
Like old McDonald's was
We have all the things that a farm should have
And a whole lot of love

We have a sun of mornings and a moon of nights
And I feel bad of hold me tights
It rains but not too much
We got a whole lot of love

Got him a big box of bullets to fit into his 44
The storeman said son are you gonna work you know you owe me too much to stop
John said I got a little working to do but I ain't goin' by your clock

People said John was a slacker cause he wouldn't fight in their war
A man wasn't much if he wouldn't fight back in nineteen forty and four
The doctor said John was just too sick to go
But the people said that he was a coward

And one of the men makin' fun of him was a feller named a Milton Howard
Milton was down at the Cold Spring a drinkin' from a Mason jar
He said John you better get yourself to work you gonna fool around till you get fired
John blew the dust from his old 44 put two holes in Milton's head

When Johnny walked off to get some more shootin' done
That old Cold Spring was a runnin' with red
Next guy he met was a Steagall boy and the boy had a hammer in his hand
John said son you should've built yourself a box

'Cause you're aheaded for the Promised Land
Steagall fell down to his knees to pray and he cried Lord Johnny please don't shoot
Before he got half way to sayin' amen well old John shot him out of his boots

Word went out through the County that old John had lost his head
The people were running and screaming there were seven of 'em layin' there dead
Johnny hid out in a farmhouse he had satisfaction in his eyes
He said I know they're coming to get me boys but they ain't a gonna take me alive

People gathered round that old farmhouse was the relatives of all them dead
Now John said if the sheriff comes through that door I'm gonna fill him plum full of lead
The sheriff kicked down that old farmhouse door but old John's gun would not shoot
Johnny just smiled at the sheriff and said the Lord must think a lot of you

They took old John to the jailhouse he entered in a guilty plea
The judge said death in the electric chair cause it's murder in the first degree
John's last meal was a lot of fried chicken cold beans and a baby squash
He ate every bite that they brought him then he smiled and said I thank you all a lot

Stranded in a honky-tonk, somewhere 'tween dates
There was a little band playin' as I sipped my beer
But I never thought that I'd hear what I'd hear

There was a young man a pickin' 'lectric guitar
Smokin' and a snippin', a learnin' how to be a star
He had a big blue bandanna tied around his head
A laid-back bass and a drummer named Red

Well, his hair was cut long in the fashion of the time
Sandpaper vocal but he milked every line
His fingers like lightnin' on the guitar that he played
He did ""Lay Down Sally"" and""Hank Didn't Do It This Way""

Well, I sat there and listened for over an hour
And the closest thing to country was a rockin' ""Wildwood Flower""
And I got that feelin' that I had been there before
But I knew I had never been through that door

Well, the jukebox was turned on and the band took a break
I made my way up front to howdy and shake
I said, ""Son, I like your music and I kinda like your style.""
But it seemed to me that I had seen that smile

Well, he stood there for a moment, then he laughed and he slapped his knee

He said yeah whiskey gets 'em and whiskey gets many
But listen son nothin' kills people like greed
I said huh and I turned to him and he was a cowboy
Bout fifty years old in a big western hat

Sir if you said that greed killed more people than whiskey
If my taxi don't come tell me more bout that

He said I knew a guy who made millions on millions
Then he turned right around and made millions on that
He had crude oil and blue chips and good barns and feed lots
He could touch an old steer and just turn into fat

And he coveted the money that other folks lived on
He never spent nickels he thought he could keep
It was money that made him a night hawk and a worrier
And soon it was money that robbed him of sleep

And they buried him deep in a west Texas graveyard
They put up a tombstone of all he had done
And I am the man that he fired for a few beers
But I'm sure feeling good in the west Texas sun

And he saw a sorta harmonica lyin' there in the sun
He thought of the music the harp could be playing
He closed his old eyes and he started to hum
He hummed an old song bout an unfaithful lover
He hummed the sweet tune about children at play
He hummed the bright song about beer drinking buddies
One about Jesus and uncloudy day
Well he bought the harmonica and he took it on home
With his youth all behind him and livin' alone
He soon learned to play it as pure and as cool as any great master musician could do

He played the sweet tune about children at play
He played the bright song about beer drinking buddies

They lowered him down and they put the dirt on him ashes to ashes to Jesus a prayer

He worked out in the white man's yard and he loved to sing and play
Ol' Coot worked hard God rest his soul he never was much to roam
His entire band was an old guitar a cigarette paper and a comb

Now ol' Coot had one song that he would sing when his long days were put in
There ain't nobody knows that song now cause I reckon that it died with him
His songs were made up 'o dry bones from pain and sweat and tears
And Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy was sometimes all you'd hear
Now on Saturdays ol' Coot didn't work much 'cepten he built a fire in the stove
And when he get through he'd mosey on down and sit by the gravel road
He'd hum that song as he walked along with the faraway look in his eyes
And he sat there by the road all day watched them fine Ford cars go by
Now on Saturday night the white folks danced and ol' Coot he'd pick and sing
He had an old RC bottle neck that he'd slide up and down them strings
Now Coot didn't care much for lyrics he just made 'em up as he went along
And Lord I wish they had tape back then cause I'd sure love to hear them songs
Well his clothes were old and his hair was gray and hard work had bent his back
His songs were never recognized by statuettes or flags
His songs were all about the working man and Coot never owned a tie
The only thing he ever really had to do was die

And he said he played the banjer pretty good

Now John said, ""If the sheriff comes through that door I'm gonna fill him plumb full of lead.""

And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica

So won't you come back to Jamaica?
You know it isn't so far
Look up in the sky where you left me that night
I'll be standing right under that star

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see

She said good evening too
Out there somewhere, you know I could swear
She sent a message of true love from you

And the new year just got here, you see

A new moon makes someone lovesick

In fairness to my music and my friends so I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again

I walked and did some window shopping

I took a memory to lunch

We sat and talked about the old days
With misty teardrops in our eyes
And reconfirmed an old suspicion
The past grows old but never dies

The charm that draws two hearts together
By four o' clock was just too much

Were down to just two coffee cups

so I never read the story, I just saw the headline and kept going.

His eyes were sharp as razor blades his face was leather tan 
His toes were pointed inward from a-hangin' on a horse 
He was an old philosopher, of course

He was so thin I swear you could have used him for a whip 
He had to drink a beer to keep his britches on his hips 
I knew I had to ask him about the mysteries of life 
He spit between his boots and he replied
""It's faster horses, younger women, 
Older whiskey, and more money""

He smiled and all his teeth were covered with tobacco stains 
He said, ""It don't do men no good to pray for peace and rain. 
Peace and rain is just a way to say prosperity, 
And buffalo chips is all it means to me.""

I told him I was a poet, I was lookin' for the truth 
I do not care for horses, whiskey,

My soul was all on fire

I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him to his feet

And these friends of mine came up and brought me this real old book
About John Henry and they told me if they let me read this old book I'd
Probably write a song about it. 
And they did and I did and I called it more About John Henry.)

First of all John Henry was a black man
He was born where the sun don't ever shine
He was six feet tall he didn't know his own strength
But he did not swing the hammer all the time
Of course he didn't John Henry had some women on his mind.

There was a woman cross the street named Poor Selma
Loved John Henry like a natural man
John Henry quit Poor Selma just like he was quitting work
He loved that stinger of Julie Anne
And what is it a stinger is something else you understand.

There was a man named Stacker Lee in Argenta a little man with a big 44
You know he shot his woman down and took a shot at Poor Selma
But ol' Stacker won't be shooting anymore
He had to quit it John Henry laid him dead on the floor.

John Henry threw Stacker Lee in the river
Then he said I've got a say so to say
He broke out in a song that was wrote by Blind Leonard
He said Julie Anne I'm singing my say
He said I love you but I do not like your lowdown ways.

Well, John Henry went to a conjuring woman
Said this misery ain't no way to live
Somebody's back door creeping on my pretty Julie Anne
Conjure woman had a say so to give
She said, ""John Henry."" she said, ""That's just the way things is.""

Well, John Henry went to a hell busting man
Said I'm tormented deep in my soul
Well, that hell buster prayed John Henry's sins away
And they tell me that the thunder did roll
Sweet Jesus what a frightening sight to behold.

From that day on John Henry was a changed man
All he did was just work all the time
Well, he worked till the muscles in his body gave out
Then he kept right on a working in his mind
Don't do it cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time.

Julie Anne said John Henry I love you
Poor Selma said John Henry you're my man
Ruby said I'm gonna cook ye up some greens and some lean meat
With corn bread in a four foot pan
With lots of cracklings but John Henry was a different kinda man.

Well, they allow that hard work killed John Henry, 
I'm gonna leave that allowing up to you,
Well, was he killed by hard work or was he killed by bad women
Be sure that this ain't happening to you.

Quit working when your day's work work is through
Cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time
And ain't that just the way the things is

Quit working when your your day's work is through God bless you",More About John Henry,1994

I was sittin' in miami pourin' blended whiskey down
When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge

There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watchin' ""ironsides"" on tv
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine

""Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?"" he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
""Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime,
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine.""

He said, ""women think about they-selves, when menfolk ain't around.
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down.""
He said, ""I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime;
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine.""

""Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes;
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate.""
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
'Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine.

I had to catch a plane up to atlanta that next day
As I left for my room I saw him pickin' up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime

And you can buy a bag of bird seed anywhere
You mix it all together and you put it on the ground
And pretty soon the birds come around

And I thought to myself, ""Boy, look at that will you. Look what the law allows.""

I thought I'd do them a favor, so I offered to hold the child
When I held the little girl in my arms, I was glad of the offer I'd made
She said, ""Thank you, mister, for holding me up; I wanted to see the parade.""
Then she asked me a question, and it took me by surprise

She said, ""Mister, why does my daddy hate all those people going by?""
I said, ""Well you know they're not the same--but listen to me""
And I noticed that the child was blind, so I looked around for an answer; it was pretty hard to find
So I set her down by her mama's side and I patted her on the head

Country music still plays on the jukebox every night
Society is not for me, but I can still be found
Oh, we miss you on the old side of town

RSVP is not for me and black tie's not my style
I thought you'd like to know 'cause you ain't been here for awhile
We read about your tour de force, we're glad you get around

Educated, well-intentioned, good girl in our town
I wonder where i'd be today if she had loved me too
Probably be driving kids to school

I guess i owe it all to Pamela brown
All of my good times and all my roamin' around
One of these days i might come ramblin' through your town
And i guess i owe it all to Pamela brown

I've seen the lights of cites and i've been inside their doors
I've sailed to foreign countries and i've walked upon their shores
I guess the guy she married was the best part of my luck
She dug him 'cause he drove a pick-up truck

The man said son that water'll help to keep your cottage cool
The Welcome Wagon brought me out some sleepin' pills and booze
I got the mean old subdivision blues
Somebody came and knocked my fence down just the other day
Tore up my yard and hauled my lawnmower away
Shot out my windows with the BB gun
A buggsy down the street came by and beat up my son
So I went out and bought myself a big old German dog
The man behind me saw me and he started raisin' hogs
A nineteen year old girl next door is sunnin' in the nude
I got those mean old subdivision blues
But I bought my house because it was located near a school
Now a bus comes by and takes my kids to Istambul
The guy next door just bought his son a brand new saxophone
The man behind me sued him cause his hogs were leavin' home
My buddy left his wife now he's livin' in a tent
A hippie sued me cause I did not have a room to rent
They built a trailer park before I had a chance to move

I couldn't even get the Grand Ole Opry on the radio

The law came out and said that I would have to move my barn
They said the man next door was gonna subdivide his farm
They auctioned off my farm to build the state another school
I got the mean old subdivision blues
Well other night I dreamed I died and I went right straight to hell
I don't know what I did but you know you can never tell
They handed me a key and handed me a little map
They said you got a place to live we'll show you where it's at

We used to go out courtin' along October Hill
She could laugh away the dark clouds cry away the snow
Seems like only yesterday down the road I go

Tom T. Hall,"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
She said, ""Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""
The note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking and a-runnin' 'round with men and going wild
And we don't believe you ought to be bringing up your little girl this way""

It was signed by the secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.
Well, it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.""
Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date

Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?
Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin

Then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.

Tom T. Hall,"One time I spent a week inside a little country jail
I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at red light when these two men come and got me
And said that I was speedin' through their town

They said, ""Tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go""
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there over night so I'd just call my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long

They motioned me inside the cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cell mate said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer

We had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down

Next morning they'd just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I get my release
Later on we got more hot bologna eggs and gravy
By now I wasn't quite so hard to please

Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewing on the straw
He said, ""Where is this guy who thinks that this is Indianapolis
I'd like to talk to him about the law""

Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be a gettin' on my way
That part about me being who I was did not impress him
He said, ""The judge will be here any day""

The jailer had his wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to looking so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away

Next morning that old judge took every nickel that I had
He said, ""Son, let this teach you not to race""
The jailer's wife was smiling from the window as I left
In thirty minutes I was out of state",A Week in a County Jail,2006

Tom Thorndike,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

Whatever you might wish
You know it's been my song

It took a long long time to become myself

With your american gift
Where there is money and skill
You gave another twist
To the proverbial screw

I should have looked deeper
Deeper still
Into your very soul

I gave you what was mine
Your wanting more belies
The fact that you've got dollar signs
In both your little eyes

I will cut out
The dead wood
The bad rot
Or find another love

Mercenary people
Messing with my heart
Nasty little devils
Always interfere with ours

Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love

And I could not resist
A calculated risk
Since he was o-o-o-over me, oh-oh-oh

Nothing to lose, everything to gain
And now I have no doubt
I could not live without him

We'll love that babe our own sweet family
And we will live in style
And make it well worthwhile
'cause I am o-o-o-over him, oh-oh-oh

I tell you he was a masterpiece
How are you says I
Just cool says he
He never shook my hand
He was no gentleman
But he was o-o-o-over me, oh-oh-oh

I tell you he knew the pleasure of love
Yes it's true he knew the pleasure of love

Pleasure of love, love, love, love ...
Pleasure of love, love, love, love ...
Pleasure of love, love, love, love ...

We broke the rules but we won the game
Nothing to lose and everything to gain
And he will marry me
I'll carry his baby
Because I'm o-o-o-over him, oh-oh-oh

Pleasure of love ..., pleasure of love ...
I tell you he knew the pleasure of love ...

Hey boy, forget what you know
Get down under the far below
Do you see that you are in
Foxy fox's foxy den
Watch out how you play with her
Mind that you don't rumple her fur

Can I really trust you to be fair

Love is all that cuts to the heart
Keep him by being a friend

Feel the shimmers of the earthquake
Breeding animals that keep you awake
Feeling at one with the falling snow

And no amount of faith will do
Oh we're broken but we fit together

Well I walk the plank
And crawl through the mine,

Well I've been told

When I heard your name,
I looked into my cup,
Lo, and behold,
The seven seas came up,
When I hear your voice,
The arrow flies,
The street turns silver
And the fools get wise,
When you flash lightning,
You flash lightning,
You flash lightning,
You flash lightning.

Someone no-one can tame,

Important. Electricity means so much more to me. We men

Of science... you know...
It's snowing again, seems like it's always snowing. Sit
Down to write and it's so cold. Outside my window, there's
A tree so white I can hardly look at it.

All so well defined. Please send my winter coat soon as you can

Tom Verlaine,"I think of you, I think of you.
I had this friend who told me that
Coincidence cannot articulate the best
Events. She said she'd rather think of
Everything as accident, after all, it's
All heaven-sent. She said I don't think
Good but I know how to wait as if when
You wait it is not hours but some forgotten
Sense of time. It's very kind of all those
Powers to feature love without design.
Letters arrive, spelling out the wish so

Clear, making a language of desire and fear.
You said it's not that way... God is not the
Name of God... you'll send a drawing of the heart
I don't draw well but I know how to wait as if...
I think of you listening to your father's voice...
Those endless speeches on 'The Gift of Choice'.
Love's not a story I could ever read or write...
I guess you'd say I'm not so bright. Show me
How you wait... as if...
I am so fond of you, so fond of you.
These difficult questions tell me a joke.",Song,1987

As long as there is no shipwreck.
Yes I do,
Oh, yes I do.

I should have brought my raincoat,
I knew I should have brought it.)

My illusions disappear,
At the very thought of you,
Like last night's rain from the rooftops.

Now it's August twenty-fourth.
Cool as the lining of your coat,
I read the sign but do not stop.

Beneath the silent blue delivery.
No metaphor, no memory.
Above the hours, always shining through.

Just the sweetest...
Just the sweetest...

Goodness gracious, my, oh, my.
I'm really off the hinges,
Thinking of time as something tight, so tight.

But you've made a garden from,
A single tulip on the bed.
I count my blessings all the night.

A quiet room, not long ago;
Beneath the silent blue delivery.
No metaphor, no memory.
Above the hours, always shining through.

Course I know that it's not wise,
Gazing into sunlight.
Just the things it falls upon.

But the final vision has
Grown at least a hundred-fold.
I see your disillusion gone.

A quiet room, not long ago.
Beneath the silent room, deliver me.

Tom Verlaine,"It was a tight toy night, streets so bright
The world was so thin between my bones and skin
There stood another person who was a little surprised
To be face to face with a world so alive

How I fell (did you feel low?)
No (huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus De Milo

You know it's all like some new kind of drug
My senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves
Broadway looked so medieval
It seemed to flap, like little pages
And I fell sideways laughing
With a friend from many stages

How we felt (did you feel low?)
Not at all (huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus De Milo

Suddenly my eyes went so soft and shaky
I knew there was pain but pain is not aching
Then Richie, Richie said
""Hey man, let's dress up like cops, think of what we could do""
Something, something said ""you better not""

And I fell (did you feel low?)
Nah (huh?)
I stood up, walked out of the arms of Venus De Milo",Venus,1998

With that undulating beat
And some Bonneville is screaming
It's way wilder down the street

[Chorus]

Hearts flutter and race
The moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes
The night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers
Cherry delight
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound
And it cuts through the night

And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon",Drunk on the Moon,1974
Tom Waits,"A cab combs the snake,
Tryin' to rake in that last night's fare,
And a solitary sailor
Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers

Paws his inside P-coat pocket for a welcome twenty-five cents,
And the last bent butt from a package of Kents,
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair

Her rhinestone-studded moniker says, Irene
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes
And the Texaco beacon burns on,
The steel-belted attendant with a ring and valve special
Cryin' fill'er up and check that oil
You know it could be a distributor and it could be a coil

The early mornin' final edition's on the stands,
And that town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands
Pigs in a blanket sixty-nine cents
Eggs, roll 'em over and a package of Kents
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em damn straight
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late

And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds
Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe Devilles
Leaving the town in a-keeping
Of the one who is sweeping
Up the ghost of Saturday night",The Ghosts of Saturday Night (After Hours at Napoleone's Pizza House),1974
Tom Waits,"The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
But I just know there's got to be more

So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel and I'm blind
If I exorcise my devils
Well my angels may leave too
When they leave they're so hard to find

So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

We're always at each other's throats
It drives me up the wall
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me
And I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams

So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets

Tom Waits,"I never saw the mornin' 'til I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light
I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody until I needed the song

I never saw the white line 'til I was leavin' you behind
I never knew I needed you until I was caught up in a bind
I never spoke ""I love you"" 'til I cursed you in vain
I never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane

I never saw the east coast until I moved to the west
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off of your breast
I never saw your heart until someone tried to steal it, tried to steal it away
I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face

I never saw the mornin' 'til I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out your love light babe

Tom Waits,"Well you hate those diesels rollin'
And those Friday nights out bowlin'
When he's off for a twelve hour lay over night

You wish you had a dollar
For every time he hollered
That he's leavin'
And he's never comin' back

But the curtain-laced billow
And his hands on your pillow
And his trousers are hangin' on the chair

You're lyin' through your pain, babe
But you're gonna tell him he's your man
And you ain't got the courage to leave

He tells you that you're on his mind
You're the only one he's ever gonna find
It's kind-a special, understands his complicated soul

But the only place a man can breathe
And collect his thoughts is
Midnight and flyin' away on the road.

But you've packed and unpacked
So many times you've lost track
And the steam heat is drippin' off the walls

But when you hear his engines
You're lookin' through the window in the kitchen and you know
You're always gonna be there when he calls

Cause he's a truck drivin' man
Stoppin' when he can
He's a truck drivin' man
Stoppin' when he can",Semi Suite,1974
Tom Waits,"All my friends are married
Every Tom and Dick and Harry
You must be strong
To go it alone
Here's to the bachelors
And the bowery bums
And those who feel that they're the ones
Who are better off without a wife
I like to sleep until the crack of noon
Midnight howlin' at the moon
Goin' out when I wanto, comin' home when I please
I don't have to ask permission
If I want to go out fishing
And I never have to ask for the keys
Never been no Valentino
Had a girl who lived in Reno
Left me for a trumpet player
Didn't get me down
He was wanted for assault
Though he said it weren't his fault
Well the coppers rode him right
Out of town
(chorus) selfish about my privacy
As long as I can be with me
We get along so well I can't believe
I love to chew the fat with folks
And listen to all your dirty jokes
I'm so thankful for these friends
I do receive

Tom Waits,"There's a blur drizzle down the plate glass 
As a neon swizzle stick stirrin' up the sultry night air 
And a yellow biscuit of a buttery cue ball moon 
Rollin' maverick across an obsidian sky 
As the busses go groanin' and wheezin' 
Down on the corner I'm freezin' 
On a restless boulevard at a midnight road 
I'm across town from easy street
 
With the tight knots of moviegoers and out of towners 
On the stroll 
And the buildings towering high above 
Lit like dominoes or black dice 
All the used car salesmen dressed up in 
Purina Checkerboard slacks 
And Foster Grant wrap-around, 
Pacing in front of Earl Schlieb 
$39.95 merchandise 

Like barkers at a shootin' gallery 
They throw out kind of a Texas Guinan routine 
""Hello sucker, we like your money 
Just as well as anybody else's here"" 
Or they give you the P.T. Barnum bit 
""There's a sucker born every minute 
You just happened to be comin' along at the right time"" 
Come over here now 

You know, all the harlequin sailors are on the stroll 
In a search of ""Like new,"" ""new paint,"" 
Decent factory air and am-fm dreams 
And the piss yellow gypsy cabs 
Stacked up in the taxi zones waitin' like 
Pinball machines 
To be ticking off a joy ride to a magical place 

Waitin' in line like ""truckers welcome"" diners 
With dirt lots full of 
Peterbilts, Kenworths, Jimmy's and the like, and 
They're highballing' with bankrupt brakes, over driven 
Under paid, over fed, a day late and a dollar short 
But Christ I got my lips around a bottle and 
My foot on the throttle and I'm standin' on the corner 
Standin' on the corner like a ""just in town""

The way that I love you

Love's bittersweet, life's treasures deep
No one can keep a love that's gone wrong

Nobody, nobody, gonna love you

Cause nobody's that strong
No nobody's that strong

Nobody, nobody, is gonna love you

In a twilight mirror mirage
With no indication of a service station
Or an all night garage, I was misinformed
I was misdirected cause the interchange
Never intersected leaving me marooned
Beneath a bloodshot moon
All upon a foggy night, on a foggy night
An abandoned road, in a blurred brocade
Collage, is that a road motel?
I can't really tell, is that what you
Might call some kind of a vacancy lodge
Cause there's no consolation, what
Kind of situation to be aimlessly skewed
Amidst a powder blue?

Just like bounced checks, rubbin' their necks
And the sky turned the color of Pepto-Bismol
And the parking lots growled
And my old sports coat full of promissory notes
And a receipt from a late night motel
And the hawk had his whole family out
There in the wind, and he's got a message
For you to beware cause he be kickin' your
Ass in, in a cold blooded fashion

I got shoes untied, shirt tail's out, ain't got a
Ghost of a chance with this old romance

And the manager's scowlin', feet on his desk
Boom boom against the curtain
You're still hurtin'
And then push came to shove, shove came to biff

Maybe I'll go to Cleveland or
Get me a tattoo or somethin', my brother

Same ol' riff. Hey baby come up to

Smooth music on the stereo, no thank you
Got any Stan Getz records
No I got Smothers Brothers
So I combed back my Detroit
Jack up my pegs, wiped my Stacy Adams
Jacknifed my legs, yea I got designs
On a moving violation
Hey baby, you put me on hold and I'm
Out in the wind and it's getting
Mighty cold
Colder than a gut shot bitch wolf dog
With nine sucking pups pullin' a four trap
Up a hill in the dead of winter
In the middle of a snowstorm
With a mouth full of porcupine quills
(scat) yea well I don't need you baby
It's a well known fact
I'm four sheets to the wind
I'm glad you're gone
I'm glad you're gone
I'm finally alone
Glad you're gone, but I
Wish you'd come home

Tom Waits,"Well you see I happened to be back on the east coast
A few years back tryin' to make me a buck
Like everybody else, well you know
Times get hard and well I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roamin' and bummin'
Around, so I started thumbin' my way
Back to my old hometown
You know I made quite a few miles
In the first couple of days, and I
Figured I'd be home in a week if my
Luck held out this way
But you know it was the third night
I got stranded, it was out at a cold lonely
Crossroads, and as the rain came
Pouring down, I was hungry, tired
Freezin', caught myself a chill, but
It was just about that time that
The lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should of seen me smile when I
Heard them air brakes come on, and
I climbed up in that cab where I
Knew it'd be warm at the wheel
Well at the wheel sat a big man
I'd have to say he must of weighed 210
The way he stuck out a big hand and
Said with a grin ""Big Joe's the name
And this here rig's called Phantom 309""
Well I asked him why he called his
Rig such a name, but he just turned to me
And said ""Why son don't you know this here
Rig'll be puttin' 'em all to shame, why
There ain't a driver on this
Or any other line for that matter
That's seen nothin' but the taillights of Big Joe
And Phantom 309""
So we rode and talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his and
I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
He pushed her ahead with 10 forward gears
Man that dashboard was lit like the old
Madam La Rue pinball, a serious semi truck
Until almost mysteriously, well it was the
Lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me and said ""I'm sorry son
But I'm afraid this is just as far as you go
You see I kinda gotta be makin' a turn
Just up the road a piece,"" but I'll be
Damned if he didn't throw me a dime as he
Threw her in low and said ""Go on in there
Son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee
On Big Joe""
And when Joe and his rig pulled off into
The night, man in nothing flat they was
Clean outta sight
So I walked into the old stop and
Ordered me up a cup of mud sayin'
""Big Joe's settin' this dude up"" but
It got so deathly quiet in that
Place, you could of heard a pin drop
As the waiter's face turned kinda
Pale, I said ""What's the matter did
I say somethin' wrong?"" I kinda
Said with 8a half way grin. He said
""No son, you see It'll happen every
Now and then. You see every driver in
Here knows Big Joe, but let me
Tell you what happened just ten years
Ago, yea it was ten years ago
Out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Where you flagged Joe down, and
There was a whole bus load of kids
And they were just comin' from school
And they were right in the middle when
Joe topped the hill, and could
Have been slaughtered except
Joe turned his wheels, and
He jackknifed, and went
Into a skid, and folks around here
Say he gave his life to save that bunch
Of kids, and out there at that cold
Lonely crossroads, well they say it
Was the end of the line for
Big Joe and Phantom 309, but it's
Funny you know, cause every now and then
Yea every now and then, when the
Moon's holdin' water, they say old Joe
Will stop and give you a ride, and
Just like you, some hitchhiker will be
Comin' by""
""So here son,"" he said to me, ""get
Yourself another cup of coffee, it's on the
House, you see I want you to hang on
To that dime, yea you hang on to that
Dime as a kind of souvenir, a
Souvenir of Big Joe and Phantom 309""",Big Joe and Phantom 309,1976

Burned hundred-dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew

But the last of the big-time losers shouted before he drove away,
""I'll be right back, as soon as I crack the one that got away""
Well, the ambulance drivers, they don't give a shit,
They just want to get off work, and
The short stop and the victim are already gone berserk
And the shroud-tailor measures him for a deep-six holiday,
The stiff is froze, the case is closed on the one that got away
Now Jim Crow's directing traffic with them cemetery blues,
With them peculiar-looking trousers, them old Italian shoes
And a wooden kimono that was all ready to drop in San Francisco Bay
But he's mumbling something all about the one that got away
And Costello was the champion at the St. Moritz Hotel,
And the best this side of Fairfax, reliable sources tell
But his reputation is at large, and he's at Ben Frank's every day,
Waiting for the one that got away
He got a snakeskin sportshirt, and he looks like Vincent Price,
With a little piece of chicken, and he's carving off a slice
Someone tipped her off, and she'll be doing a Houdini now any day
She shook his hustle, and a Greyhound bus'll take the one that got away
Well, Andre's at the piano behind the Ivar in the sewers,
With a buck a shot for pop tunes, and a fin for guided tours
He could-a been in ""Casablanca"", he stood in line out there all day
Now he's spilling whiskey and learning songs about a one that got away
Well I've lost my equilibrium and my car keys and my pride,
The tattoo parlor's warm, and so I hustle there inside
And the grinding off the buzz-saw, ""What you want that thing to say?""
I says, ""Just don't misspell her name, buddy, she's the one that got away""",The One That Got Away,1976
Tom Waits,"Smelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp,
I ain't got a quarter, got a postage stamp
Been five o'clock shadow boxing all around the town,
Talking with the old man, sleeping on the ground
Bazanti bootin al zootin' al hoot and Al Cohn
Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole
And a fish-net stocking, spike-heel shoes,
Strip tease, prick tease, car keys blues
And the porno floor show, live nude girls,
Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls
Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose
Raise my rent and take off all your clothes
With trench coats, magazines, a bottle full of rum,
She's so good, make a dead man come
Pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze
Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie and Fifi live from Gay Paree
Fanfares, rim shots, back stage, who cares, all this hot burlesque for me
(scat)
Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips
Chopped and channeled and lowered and lewd
And the cheater slicks and baby moons
She's a-hot and ready, creamy and sugared
And the band is awful and so are the tunes
(scat)
Crawling on her belly, and shaking like jelly,
And I'm getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres
And cheers from the (hmm) compendium here
""Hey sweetheart"" they're yelling for more
You're squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor
And I like Shelly, and you like Jane
And what was the girl with the snakeskin's name?
And it's an early-bird matinee, come back any day,
Get you a little something that you can't get at home
Get you a little something that you can't get at home
It's pasties and a G-string, beer and a shot

Popcorn, front row, higher than a kite, and I'll be back tomorrow night,
And I'll be back tomorrow night

Tom Waits,"I guess things were always quiet
Around Putnam County
Kind of shy and sleepy as it clung to the skirts
Of the 2-lane, that was stretched out like an
Asphalt dance floor where all the oldtimers would
Hunker down in bib jeans and store bought boots
Lyin' about their lives and the places that they'd been
Suckin' on Coca Colas and be spittin' Days Work
They's be suckin' on Coca Colas
And be spittin' Day's Work
Until the moon was a stray dog on the ridge and
The taverns would be swollen until the naked eye
Of two a.m., and the Stratocaster guitars slung over
Burgermeister beer guts, and the swizzle stick legs
Jacknifed over naugahyde stools and the
Witch hazel spread out over the linoleum floors,
The pedal pushers stretched out over midriff bulge
And the coiffed brunette curls over Maybelline eyes
Wearing Prince Machiavelli, Estee Lauder,
Smells so sweet
I elbowed up at the counter with mixed feelings
Over mixed drinks
And Bubba and the Roadmasters moaned in pool hall
Concentration as they knit their brows to
Cover the entire Hank Williams Song Book
And the old National register was singing to the
Tune of $57.57
Until last call, one last game of 8 ball
And Berneice would be putting the chairs on the tables,
Someone come in say ""Hey man, anyone got
Any Jumper Cables, is that a 6 or a 12 volt?""
And all the studs in town would toss 'em down
And claim to fame as they stomped their feet
Boasting about being able to get more ass
Than a toilet seat.
And the GMCs and the Straight 8 Fords
Were coughing and wheezing and they
Perculated as they tossed the gravel
Underneath the fenders to weave home
A wet slick anaconda of a two lane
With tire irons and crowbars a rattlin'
With a tool box and a pony saddle
You're grinding gears, shifting into first
Yea and that goddam tranny's just getting worse
With the melodies of ""see ya later""
And screwdrivers on carburettors
Talkin' shop about money to loan
And palominos and strawberry roans
See ya tomorrow, hello to the Mrs.
Money to borrow and goodnight kisses
The radio spittin' out Charlie Rich
Sure can sing that sonofabitch
And you weave home, weavin' home
Leaving the little joint winking in the
Dark warm narcotic American night
Beneath a pin cushion sky and it's
Home to toast and honey, start
Up the Ford, your lunch money's there on the
Draining board, toilet's runnin' shake the
Handle, telephone's ringin' it's Mrs Randal
Where the hell are my goddam sandals
And the porcelain poodles and the glass swans
Staring down from the knick knack shelf
With the parent permission slips for the
Kids' field trips
Pair of Muckalucks scraping across
The shag carpet
And the impending squint of
First light, that lurked behind
A weeping marquee in downtown Putnam
And would be pullin' up any minute now
Just like a bastard amber
Velveeta yellow cab on a rainy corner
And be blowin' its horn, in every window
In town.",Putnam County,1976
Tom Waits,"Small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight

And the cabbies were the only ones that really had it made

And crumpled in his fist was a five-dollar bill
And the naked mannequins with their Cheshire grins,
And the raconteurs and roustabouts said buddy, come on in, 'cause
'Cause the dreams ain't broken down here now, they're walking with a limp
Now that small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight

And nobody flinched down by the arcade
And the burglar alarm's been disconnected,
And the newsmen start to rattle
And the cops are telling jokes about some whorehouse in Seattle
And the fire hydrants plead the fifth amendment
And the furniture is bargains galore
But the blood is by the jukebox on an old linoleum floor
And what a hot rain on forty-second street
And now the umbrellas ain't got a chance
And the newsboy's a lunatic with stains on his pants, 'cause
'Cause small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight

And no one's gone over to close his eyes
And there's a racing form in his pocket,
Circled blue boots in the third
And the cashier at the clothing store didn't say a word
As the siren tears the night in half, and someone lost his wallet
Well, a surveillance of assailance, it that's what you want to call it
And the whores hike up their skirts and fish for drug-store prophylactics
With their mouths cut just like razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos
And her radiator's steaming and her teeth are in a wreck, and nah,
She won't let you kiss her, but what the hell do you expect?
And the gypsies are tragic and if you want to buy perfume,
Well, they'll bark you down like carneys, sell you christmas cards in June, but

No more chewing gum or baseball cards or overcoats or dreams
Someone's hosing down the sidewalk, and he's only in his teens, 'cause
'Cause small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight

And a fistful of dollars can't change that,
And someone copped his watch fob, and someone got his ring
And the newsboy got his porkpie Stetson hat
And the tuberculosis old men at the nelson wheeze and cough
And someone will head south until this whole thing cools off, 'cause

She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer
So welcome to the continuing saga, she was my better half, and I was just a dog
And so here am I slumped, I've been chipped and I've been chumped on my stool
So buy this fool some spirits and libations, it's these railroad station bars
And all these conductors and porters, and I'm all out of quarters

No, the moon ain't romantic, it's intimidating as hell,
And some guy's trying to sell me a watch
And so I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream, it's so maudlin it seems,
You can name your poison, go on ahead and make some noise
I ain't sentimental, this ain't a purchase, it's a rental, and it's purgatory,
And hey, what's your story, well I don't even care
Cause I got my own double-cross to bear

And I'll see your Red Label, and I'll raise you one more,
And you can pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more,

I've been a cabbie and a stock clerk and a soda-fountain jock-jerk
And a manic mechanic on cars.
It's nice work if you can get it, now who the hell said it?
I got money to spend on my gal,
But the work never stops, and I'll be busting my chops
Working for Joe and Sal.

And I can't wait to get off work and see my baby,
She said she'd leave the porch light on for me.
I'm disheveled and I'm disdainful and I'm distracted and it's painful,
But this job sweeping up here is gainfully employing me tonight.

Well Tom, do this and Tom, do that, and Tom, don't do that,
Count the cash, clean the oven, dump the trash,

Tom Waits,"Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula,
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues

And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue

She said How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?
You say 'anyway's the only way', be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues

But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze
And an open invitation to the blues

But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation to the blues

Scrawled across the shoulders of a dying town
Took the one eyed Jacks across the railroad tracks
And the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through
He's a juvenile delinquent, never learned how to behave
But the cops'd never think to look in Burma-Shave

And the road was like a ribbon, and the moon was like a bone
He didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known
He kind of looked like Farley Granger, with his hair slicked back
She says 'I'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat.
How far are you going?'
Said 'Depends on what you mean'
He says 'I'm only stopping here to get some gasoline'
'I guess I'm going thataway, just as long as it's paved
And I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma-Shave'

She took out her barrettes, and her hair spilled out like root beer
And she popped her gum and arched her back

Don't know why it don't explode
Cause everyone in this stinking town's got one foot in the grave

I want to get there â??fore the sun comes up in Burma-Shave â??

And the spider web crack and the mustang screamed
The smoke from the tires and the twisted machine
Just a nickel's worth of dreams, and every wishbone that they saved
Lie swindled from them on the way to Burma-Shave

And the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow
Up against the car door on the shotgun side

Tom Waits,"When traveling abroad in the continental style,
It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet,
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position
Allows you a perspective that's unique

And though you'll find your itinerary a blessing and a curse,
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down
And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
To stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town

Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
That remains the object of their long relentless quest
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
The pursuit, you see, and never the arrest

Without fear of contradiction, bon voyage is always hollered
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore,
By a girl who drives a Rambler and furthermore is overly concerned
That she won't see him anymore

Planes and trains and boats and buses characteristically
Evoke a common attitude of blue
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
And the cargo that they're carrying is you

And domestically approved romantic fancy,
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances,

Aw, you don't look like such a chump (aw, hey baby)",I Never Talk to Strangers,1977
Tom Waits,"California, Here I Come
Written by Joseph Meyer, Al Jolson and Buddy G. De Sylva
Jack was sittin poker faced with bullets backed with bitches
Neal hunched at the wheel puttin everyone in stiches
Braggin bout this nurse he screwed while drivin through nebraska
And when she came she honked the horn and neal just barely missed a
Truck and then he asked her if she'd like to come like that to californy
See a red head in a uniform will always get you horny
With her hairnet and those white shoes and a name tag and a hat
She drove like andy granatelli and knew how to fix a flat
And jack was almost at the bottom of his md 2020 neal was yellin
Out the window tryin to buy some bennies from a lincoln
Full of mexicans whose left rear tire blowed and the sonsobitches
Prit near almost ran off the road

well the nurse had spilled the manoshevitz all up and down her dress
Then she lit the map on fire neal just had to guess
Should we try and find a bootleg route or a fillin station open
The nurse was dumpin out her purse lookin for an envelope and
Jack was out of cigarettes we crossed the yellow line
The gas pumps looked like tombstones from here
Felt lonelier than a parking lot when the last car pulls away
And the moonlight dressed the double breasted foothills
In the mirror weaving outa negligee and a black brassiere
The mercury was runnin hot and almost out of gas
Just then florence nightingale dropped her drawers and
Stuck her fat ass half way out of the window with a
Wilson pickett tune
And shouted get a load of this and gave the finger to the moon

countin one eyed jacks and whistling dixie in the car
Neal was doin least a hundred when we saw a fallin star
Florence wished that neal would hold her stead of chewin
His cigar jack was noddin out and dreamin he was in a bar
With charlie parker on the bandstand not a worry in the world
And a glass of beer in one hand and his arm around a girl
And neal was singin to the nurse
Underneath a harlem moon
And somehow you could just tell we'd be in california soon

Tom Waits,"Muriel since you left town
The clubs closed down
And there's one more burned out lamppost
On Main Street
Down where we used to stroll

And Muriel
I still hit all the same old haunts
And you follow me wherever I go

And Muriel I see you
On a Saturday night
In a penny arcade
With your hair tied back
And the diamond twinkle
Is in your eye
Is the only wedding ring that I'll buy you
Muriel

And Muriel how many times
I've left this town
To hide from your memory
And it haunts me

But I only get as far
As the next Whiskey bar
I buy another cheap cigar
And I'll see you every night

Hey Muriel
Muriel
Hey buddy
Got a light?",Muriel,1977
Tom Waits,"Well, you can buy me a drink and I'll tell you what I've seen
And I'll give you a bargain from the edge of a maniac's dream
That buys a black widow spider with a riddle in his yarn
That's clingin' to the furrow of a blind man's brow
And I'll start talkin' from the brim of a thimble full of whiskey
On a train through the Bronx that will take you just as far
As the empty of a bottle to the highway of a scar
That stretched across the blacktop of my cheek like that
And then ducks beneath the brim of a fugitive's hat
You'll learn why liquor makes a stool pigeon rat on every face
That ever left a shadow down on Saint Mark's place

Hell, I'd double-cross my mother if it was whiskey that they paid
And so an early bird says Nightstick's on the hit parade
And he ain't got a prayer and his days are numbered
And you'll track him down like a dog
But it's a tough customer you're gettin' in this trade
'Cause the Nightstick's heart pumps lemonade
And whiskey keeps a blind man talkin' all right
And I'm the only one who knows just where he stayed last night

He was in a wreckin' yard in a switchblade storm
In a wheelbarrow with nothin' but revenge to keep him warm
And a half a million dollars in unmarked bills
Was the Nightstick's blanket in a February chill
And the buzzards drove a crooked sky beneath a black wing halo
He was dealin' high Chicago in the mud
And stackin' the deck against a dragnet's eye
And the shiverin' Nightstick in a miserable heap
With the siren for a lullaby singin' him to sleep
And bleedin' from a buttonhole, and torn by a slug
Fired from the barrel of a two dollar gun
That scorched a blister on the grip of a punk by now
Is learnin' what you have to pay to be a hero anyhow

He dressed the hole in his gut with a hundred dollar bandage
A king's ransom for a bedspread that don't amount to nothin'
Just cobweb strings on a busted ukulele

And the Nightstick leaned on a black shillelagh
With the poison of a junkie's broken promise on his lip
He staggered in the shadows screamin', I ain't never been afraid'
And he shot out every street light on the promenade
Past the frozen ham-and-eggers at the penny arcade
Throwin' out handfuls of a blood stained salary
They were dead in their tracks at the shootin' gallery
And they fired off a twenty-one gun salute
And from the corner of his eye he caught the alabaster orbs
Of a dime-a-dance-hall girl and stuffed a thousand dollar bill in her blouse
And caught the cruel and unusual punishment of her smile
And the Nightstick winked beneath a rain soaked brim
Ain't no one seen hide nor hair of him since
No one 'cept a spade on Riker's Island and me

So if you're mad enough to listen to a full of whiskey blind man
And you're mad enough to look beyond where the bloodhounds dare to go
And if you want to know where the Nightstick's hidin' out
You be down at the ferry landin', oh let's say 'bout half past a nightmare
When it's twisted on the clock, and you tell 'em Nickel sent you
Whiskey always makes him talk
And you ask for Captain Charon with the mud on his kicks
He's the skipper of the deadline steamer
And she sails from the Bronx across the river Styx
And a riddle's just a ticket for a dreamer

'Cause when the weathervane's sleepin' and the moon turns his back
You crawl on your belly 'long the railroad tracks
And cross your heart and hope to die, and stick a needle in your eye
'Cause he'd cut my bleedin' heart out if he found out that I squealed
'Cause you see a scarecrow is just a hoodlum
Who marked the cards that he dealed
And pulled a gypsy switch
Out on the edge of Potter's Field",Potter's Field,1977
Tom Waits,"A sight for sore eyes, it's a long time no see
Workin' hard hardly workin', hey man, you know me

Yeah, he spun out and he rolled, he hit a telephone pole
And he died with the radio on

No, she's married, with a kid, finally split up with Sid
He's up North for a nickel's worth for armed robbery
And I'll play you some pinball, no you ain't got a chance
Then go on over and ask her to dance

And hey barkeep, what's keepin' you, keep pourin' drinks

Tom Waits,"Little black girl in a red dress,
On a hot night with a broken shoe.
Little black girl you shouldn't never left home,
There's probably someone that's still waiting up for you.
It's cold back in Chicago,
But Los Angeles' street's worse,
When all you got is $29.00 and an alligator purse!

You'll see that vulture in the Fleetwood,
With the chartreuse hood!
It's time to get your bearings and say hey baby:
Which way's to the Main Stem?
And where ever you say you're from,
Say you grew up there yourself
Say, come on, you grew up right next door to him:
Take the left on Central
And throw it in reverse:
Cause you only got $29.00 and an alligator purse!

And he'll come on just like a gentleman
And you'll be a little shy!
You say your ex old man was a sax player
He'll say baby I used to play bass with Sly!
And you say you like his Cadillac,
Say honey I got two or three!
He'll say: Sweetheart you're sure fortunate
That you ran into me!
When you've done a dime in the joint!
You figure nothin' could be worse:
And you got $29.00 in an alligator purse!

Well: He got Pharaoh on the eight track
You start smokin' a little boo!
You thinking gettin' out of Chicago was the
Best thing ever happened to you!
He's starting like a dog rhythm
And the cats seem to be cool!
He says: Baby, I know a good ol' jailhouse
In West Hollywood that's just right for you!
But he ain't no good Samaritan,
He'll make sure you're reimbursed!!
A lot more than $29.00 and an alligator purse!

Now when the streets get hungry, baby,
You can almost hear them growl!
Someone's setting a place for you,
When the dogs begin to howl!

Well: The streets are dead they creep. It was left on the pole!
They make that the suckers always make mistakes
When they're far away from home!
Chicken in a pot
Whoever gets their first
Gonna get himself $29.00 and an alligator purse!

Now, for the sirens it's just an epilogue
The cops always get there too late!
They always stop for coffee
On the way to the scene of the crime!
They always try so hard to look like movie stars,
They couldn't catch a cold!
Baby: don't waste your dime
You're lucky to be alive!

She only lost a half pint of blood!

Tom Waits,"She sends me blue valentines
All the way from Philadelphia
To mark the anniversary
Of someone that I used to be
And it feels just like a warrant
Is out for my arrest
Baby, you got me checkin'
In my rearview mirror
That's why I'm always on the run
That's why I changed my name
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here

To send me blue valentines
Like half-forgotten dreams
Like a pebble in my shoe
As I walk these streets
And the ghost of your memory
Baby, it's the thistle in the kiss
It's the burglar that can break a rose's neck
It's the tatooed broken promise
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm going to see you every time I turn my back

She sends me blue valentines
Though I try to remain at large
They're insisting that our love
Must have a eulogy
Why do I save all of this madness
Here in the nightstand drawer
There to haunt upon my shoulders
Baby, I know
I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
With this blind and broken heart
That sleeps beneath my lapel

Instead, these blue valentines
To remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt
Or get these bloodstains off my hands
And it takes a lot of whiskey
To make these nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
And I'm going to die a little more on each St. Valentines day
Don't you remember, I promised I would write you
These blue valentines

Tom Waits,"Hey Charley I'm pregnant
Living on 9th Street
Right above a dirty bookstore
Off Euclid Avenue
I stopped taking dope
And I quit drinking whiskey
And my old man plays the trombone
And works out at the track

He says that he loves me
Even though its not his baby
He says that he'll raise him up
Like he would his own son
He gave me a ring
That was worn by his mother
And he takes me out dancin'
Every Saturday night

Hey Charley I think about you
Every time I pass a fillin' station
On account of all the grease
You used to wear in your hair
I still have that record
Of Little Anthony and The Imperials
But someone stole my record player
How do ya like that?

Hey Charley I almost went crazy
After Mario got busted
I went back to Omaha
To live with my folks
Everyone I used to know
Was either dead or in prison
So I came back to Minneapolis
This time I think I'm gonna stay

Hey Charley I think I'm happy
For the first time since my accident
I wish I had all the money
That we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot
And I wouldn't sell any of 'em
I'd just drive a different car every day
Dependin' on how I feel

Hey Charley, for chrissakes
Do you want to know the truth of it?
I don't have a husband
He don't play the trombone
I need to borrow money
To pay this lawyer
And Charley, hey
I'll be eligible for parole

Watch out for the broken glass, put your shoes and socks on and come along with me
Lets follow that fire truck
I think your house is burnin' down
Then go down to the hobo jungle
And kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel
We'll break all the windows in the old Anderson place
And steal a bunch of boysenberrys
And smear 'em on our face
I'll get a dollar from my mamas purse
And buy that skull and crossbones ring
And you can wear it around your neck
On an old piece of string

Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold
And flip him the bird
And slash the tires on the school bus
Now don't say a word
I'll take a rusty nail
And scratch your initials on my arm
And I'll show you how to sneak up on the roof of the drugstore

I'll take the spokes from your wheelchair
And a magpies wings
And I'll tie 'em to your shoulders and your feet
I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad
And cut the braces off your legs
And we'll bury them tonight in the cornfield

And we'll slide all the way down the drain

Looking so hatd against the hood of his car
Ans putting out a cigarette in his hand
And for all the pachucos at the pumps
At romeros paint and body

Well it was just another night

Save that coppers ass

And leavin' him like a dog beneath a car without his knife

And Romeo says hey man gimme a cigarette
And they all reach for their pack
And Frankie lights it for him and pats him on the back
And throws a bottle at a milk truck
And as it breaks he graps his nuts
And they all know they could've just like romeo
If they only had the guts

But romeo is bleeding but nobody can tell
And he sings along with the radio
With a bullet in his chest
And he combs back his fenders
And they all agree its clear
That everything is cool now that romeos here
But romeo is bleeding
And he winches now and then and he leans against
The car door and feels the blood in his shoes
And someones crying in the phone booth
At the five points by the store
Romeo starts his engine
And wipes the blood of the door
And he brodys through the signal
With the radio full blast
Leavin' the boys there hikin' up their chinos
And they all try to stand like romeo
Beneath the moon cut like a sicle
And they're talkin' now in Spanish about their hero

But Romeo is bleeding as he gives the man his ticket
And he climbs to the balcony at the movies
And he'll die without a wimper

They're sleepin' like a baby
On The Nickel over there

If you chew tobacco, and wish upon a star
You'll find out where the scarecrows sit
Just like punchlines between the cars
I know a place where a royal flush
Can never beat a pair
And even Thomas Jefferson
Is On The Nickel over there

So ring around the rosie, you're sleepin' in the rain
And you're always late for supper
And man you let me down, let me down again
I thought I heard a mockingbird, Roosevelt knows where
You can skip the light with grady tuck

So what becomes of all the little boys
Who run away from home?
The world just keeps gettin' bigger
Once you get out on your own
So what becomes of all the little boys
The sandman takes you where
You'll be sleepin' with a pillowman

And fall right up the stairs
I'll show you where the short dogs grow

Tom Waits,"I will leave behind all of my clothes
I wore when I was with you
All I need's my railroad boots
And my leather jacket

As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
Although my heart is breaking
I will steal away out through your
Blinds for soon you will be waking

The morning light has washed your face
And everything is turning blue now
Hold on to your pillow case
There's nothing I can do now

As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
You'll find another soldier
And I swear to God by Christmas time
There'll be someone else to hold you

The only thing I'm taking is
The scarf off of your clothesline
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers
And your broken window chimes

As I say goodbye
I'll say goodbye
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms

I'll feel my way down the darken hall
And out into the morning
The hobos at the freight yards
Have kept their fires burning

So Jesus Christ this goddamn rain
Will someone put me on a train
I'll never kiss your lips again
Or break your heart

As I say goodbye
I'll say goodbye
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms",Ruby's Arms,1980
Tom Waits,"It's too early for the circus,
It's too late for the bars,
No one's sleepin' but the paperboys,
And no one in this town is makin' any noise,
But the dogs and the milkmen and me.

The girls around here all look like Cadillacs,
No one likes a stranger here,
I'd come home but I'm afraid
That you won't take me back,
But I'd trade off everything just to have you near.

I know I'm irresponsible and I don't behave,
And I ruin everything that I do,
And I'll probably get arrested when I'm in my grave,
But I'll be savin' all my love for you.

I paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute,
With too much makeup and a broken shoe,
But her eyes were just a counterfeit,
She tried to gyp me out of it,
But you know that I'm still in love you.

Don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me,
Cause I ain't as bad as they make me out to be,
Well I may lose my mind but baby can't you see,
That I'll be savin' all my love for you.",Saving All My Love for You,1980
Tom Waits,"Well these diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying
It always makes me sing

There's a Duster tryin' to change my tune
He's pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly by a twenty-four hour moon

And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head
He's wishing he was home in a Wiscosin bed
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the East
Colder then a welldigger's ass
And it's colder than a welldigger's ass

Oceanside it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up
Those Sunday desperadoes slip by and cruise with a dry back
And the orange drive-in the neon billin'
And the theatre's fillin' to the brim
With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin

Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Fly-by-nights from Riverside
And out of state plates running a little late

But the sailors jockey for the fast lane
So 101 don't miss it
There's rolling hills and concrete fields
And the broken line's on your mind
The eights go east and the fives go north
And the merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line, signalling with a blink

And the radio's gone off the air
Gives you time to think
And you hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
And blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
And one more block, the engine talks
Whispers home at last
It whispers home at last
Whispers home at last
It whispers home at last
Whispers home at last

And there are diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got me a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
Late nights and freeway flying
Always makes me sing
It always makes me sing

Mr. Henry stumbles home
When the evening's done
He's as poor as a church mouse
High on the Meyer's rum
Tugging at his shirttail
Jiggling a church key
Chewing on a toothpick
On another binge
Trampling the rosebush
Whistin' to himself...
Now don't wake up the neighbours
Spitting on the hinge
Rattling the milkbottles
Tripping on a skate
Hidin' from the Newsboys
Before it's too late
The Screen door's open
Don't make no noise in the Kitchen
Got no excuse
For a cold, grey wife that starts bitchin'
That the no good bum's at it again
After she's given him
The best years of her life
He'll tell her he was celebrating
Savage's divorce
Played a hunch out at Yonkers

Swore he'd never do these things again

They sleep by the side of the road",Diamonds & Gold,1985
Tom Waits,"One, two, three
Falling James in the Tahoe mud
Stick around to tell us all a tale
Well, he fell in love with a Gun Street girl
And now he's dancing in the Birmingham jail
Dancing in the Birmingham jail

He took a hundred dollars off a slaughterhouse Joe
Brought a brand new Michigan twenty-gauge
He got all liquored up on that road house corn
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow Corvette
A hole in the hood of a yellow Corvette

He bought a second-hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese
And dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past four
He left for Waukegan at the slamming of the door
Left for Waukegan at the slamming of the door

I said John, John, he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home
I said John, John, he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home

He's sitting in a sycamore in St. John's wood
Soaking day-old bread in kerosene
Well, he was blue as a robin's egg and brown as a hog
He's staying out of circulation till the dogs get tired
Out of circulation till the dogs get tired

Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone
He never get up in the morning on a Saturday
Sitting by the Erie with a bull-whipped dog
Telling everyone he saw, ""they went that-a-way, boys""
Telling everyone he saw, ""they went that-a-way""

Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof
And the Burlington Northern pulling out of the world
Now a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw
And a Gun Street girl was the cause of it all
A Gun Street girl was the cause of it all

Well, he's riding in the shadow by the St. Joe ridge
Hearing the click-clack tapping of a blind man's cane
He was pulling into Baker on a New Year's Eve
One eye on a pistol and the other on the door
One eye on a pistol and the other on the door

Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Fish Row
Smuggled in a brand new pair of alligator shoes
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair
Well, they tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire
Tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire

I said John, John, he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home
I said John, John, he's long gone
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home

Banging on the table with an old tin cup
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again
Never kiss a Gun Street girl again
I'll never kiss a Gun Street girl again

Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home

Tom Waits,"Hush, a wild violet, hush, a band of gold
Hush, you're in a story I heard somebody told
Tear the promise from my heart, tear my heart today
You have found another, oh baby, I must go away

So hang down your head for sorrow, hang down your head for me
Hang down your head tomorrow, hang down your head Marie

Hush, my love, the rain now, hush, my love was so true
Hush, my love, a train now, well, it takes me away from you

So hang down your head for sorrow, hang down your head for me

Tom Waits,"Inside a broken clock
Splashing the wine
With all the Rain Dogs
Taxi, we'd rather walk
Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog, too

Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreaming
Oh, how we danced away all of the lights
We've always been out of our minds

The Rum pours strong and thin
Beat out the dustman
With the Rain Dogs
Aboard a shipwreck train
Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog, too

Oh, how we danced with the Rose of Tralee
Her long hair black as a raven
Oh, how we danced and you whispered to me
You'll never be going back home

Tom Waits,"We sail tonight for Singapore
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for a tawny moor
Took off to the land of nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I danced along a colored wind
Dangled from a rope of sand
You must say goodbye to me

We sail tonight for Singapore
Don't fall asleep while you're ashore
Cross your heart and hope to die
When you hear the children cry
Let marrow bone and cleaver choose
While making feet for children's shoes
Through the alley, back from hell
When you hear that steeple bell
You must say goodbye to me

Wipe him down with gasoline
Till his arms are hard and mean
From now on boys this iron boat's your home
So heave away, boys

We sail tonight for Singapore
Take your blankets from the floor
Wash your mouth out by the door
The whole town's made of iron ore
Every witness turns to steam
They all become Italian dreams
Fill your pockets up with earth
Get yourself a dollar's worth
Away boys, away boys, heave away

The captain is a one-armed dwarf
He's throwing dice along the wharf
In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king
So take this ring

We sail tonight for Singapore
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for a tawny moor
Took off to the land of nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I drank along a colored wind
I dangled from a rope of sand

Tom Waits,"Well, you play that tarantella, all the hounds will start to roar
The boys all go to hell and then the Cubans hit the floor
They drive along the pipeline, they tango 'til they're sore
They take apart their nightmares and they leave them by the door
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
And send me off to bed for evermore

Make sure they play my theme song, I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed till I get back in town
Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
So send me off to bed for evermore

Just make sure she's all in calico and the color of a doll
Wave the flag on Cadillac day, and a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold your breath 'til the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood, send me off to another town
And just let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair
Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs
Tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past
Will you send me off to bed for evermore?

Tom Waits,"Well, time is always money for the boys on Union Square
Go on and bust your ass 'til doomsday, don't forget to say your prayers
Someone's riding down the backstreet, said papa got a brand new slack
And your baby is handcuffed on the front seat
Sit right there, boy and you relax

C'mon honey, we're all going down-down-down-downtown, down-downtown
We're going down-downtown, We're going down-downtown

Well, you spill out of the Cinema Fourteen
To that drag bar there on the block
Whizzin' on down in front of the East Coast
Bank rolled up on your sock

She stand right there for your pleasure, half Puerto Rican-Chinese
You got to find your baby somebody to measure
I'm going to get me some of these, baby
Come on honey, do you hear what I'm doing now?

Down-down-down, down-down-down-downtown
Down-downtown, whoo, I'm going down-downtown

'Bout four in the morning on a Sunday
Sacco drinking whiskey in church
Half-pint of Festival brandy
That boy 'bout to fall right off his perch

Well, that guy in the sweater's off duty
Well, he's out in front of that welfare hotel
The guy in the dress is a beauty
Go all the way, I swear you never can tell
Come on honey, and pull up your socks

Down-down -down, I'm going down-down-down-downtown

Tom Waits,"He got himself a homemade special
You know his glass is full of sand
And it feels just like a jaybird
The way it fits into his hand

He rolled a blade up in his trick towel
They slap their hands against the wall
You never trip, you never stumble
He's walking Spanish down the hall

Slip him a picture of our Jesus
Or give him a spoon to dig a hole
What all he done ain't no one's business
But he'll need blankets for the cold
They dim the lights over on Broadway
Even the king has bowed his head
Every face looks right up at Mason
He's walking Spanish down the hall

Latella's screeching for a blind pig
Punk Sander's carved it out of wood
He never sang when he got hoodwinked
They tried it all but he never would
Tomorrow morning there'll be laundry
But he'll be somewhere else to hear the call
Don't say good bye, he's just leaving early
He's walking Spanish down the hall

All St. Bartholomew said was whispered
Into the ear of Blind Jack Dawes
All the Baker told the machine
Was that he never broke the law
Go on and tip your hat up to the Pilate
Take off your watch, your rings and all
Even Jesus wanted just a little more time
When he was walking Spanish down the hall",Walking Spanish,1985
Tom Waits,"Licorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue
Scrawled across the shoulders of a dying town
Took the one eyed-jacks across the railroad tracks
And the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through
He's a juvenile delinquent, never learned how to behave
But the cops would never think to look in Burma-Shave

And the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone
He didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known
He kind of looked like Farley Granger with his hair slicked back
She says, I'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat
How far are you going?
Said depends on what you mean
He says I'm only stopping here to get some gasoline
I guess I'm going thataway just as long as it's paved
And I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma Shave

And with her knees up on the glove compartment
She took out her barrettes and her hair spilled out like root beer
And she popped her gum and arched her back
Hell, Marysville ain't nothing but a wide spot in the road
Some nights my heart pounds like thunder
Don't know why it don't explode
'Cause everyone in this stinking town's got one foot in the grave
And I'd rather take my chances out in Burma Shave

Presley's what I go by, why don't you change the stations?
Count the grain elevators in the rearview mirror
She said mister, anywhere you point this thing
It got to beat the hell out of the sting
Of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin'
And so drill me a hole with a barber pole
And I'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight
Why don't you have another swig and pass that car if you're so brave
I wanna get there before the sun comes up in Burma Shave

And the spiderweb crack and the mustang screamed
The smoke from the tires and the twisted machine
Just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved
Lie swindled from them on the way to Burma Shave

And the sun hit the derrick and cast a batwing shadow
Up against the car door on the shotgun side
And when they pulled her from the wreck
You know she still had on her shades
They say that dreams are growing wild
Just this side
Of Burma Shave",Burma Shave,1986
Tom Waits,"Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
I got what I paid for now
See ya tomorrow, hey Frank can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English, and everything's broken
And my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me

Now the dogs are barking
And the taxicabs parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me
You tore my shirt open
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmills I staggered
You buried the dagger in
Your silhouette window light
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me

Now I've lost my St. Christopher
Now that I've kissed her and the
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinaman, and the cold-blooded signs
And the girls down by the strip tease shows go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me

No, I don't want your sympathy
The fugitives say that the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me

And you can ask any sailor
And the keys from the jailer
And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Matilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing Matilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase
To a hotel someplace
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on
An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers
The night watchman flame keepers
And goodnight Matilda, too",Tom Traubert's Blues,1986

Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
I got quiet as a churchmouse
Put my Raleighs on the dashboard
Sugar daddy caught a polo-car
There's no solitary tap dance way down here

Blow wind blow, wherever you may go
Put on your overcoat, take me into the night
Take me into the night, blow me away

I ride upon a field mouse
I was dancin' in the slaughterhouse
And it was swing along the beltway
You skid along there all day

Never slept with a dream before he had to go away
There's a bell in the tower, Uncle Ray bought a round
Don't worry 'bout the army in the cold, cold ground

Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground

Now don't be a cry baby when there's wood in the shed
There's a bird in the chimney and a stone in my bed
When the road's washed out, we pass the bottle around
And wait in the arms of the cold, cold ground

The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground

There's a ribbon in the willow and a tire swing rope
Oh, and a briar patch of berries takin' over the slope
The cat'll sleep in the mailbox and we'll never go to town
Till we bury every dream in the cold, cold ground

In the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn, let it roll down the hill
The piano is firewood, Times Square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold, cold ground

The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

And a whole box of Rebel and a bar of soap

And dream awawy when everyone's gone

Hang on St. Christopher with a barrelhouse dog
Kick me up Mount Baldy, throw me out in the fog
Tear a hole in the jackpot, drive a stake through his heart
Do a hundred on the grapevine, do a jump on the start

Hang on St. Christopher now don't let me go

Hang on St. Christopher with the hammer to the floor

Find every boot that's leaving
Shoot all the lights in the cafe

I have a French companion
I tie myself below the deck
I pull the rope around my neck
In the morning I'll be gone

Eight hundred pounds of nitro

We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls
We just gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole

All the angels sing
About Jesus' mighty sword
And they'll shield you with their wings
And keep you close to the lord
Don't pay heed to temptation
For his hands are so cold
You gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole

Down in the hole, down in the hole
Down in the hole, down in the hole
Down in the hole, down in the hole
You gotta help me keep the devil
Down in the hole",Way Down in the Hole,1987
Tom Waits,"I plugged 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
And a black crow snuck through
A hole in the sky
So I spent all my buttons on an
Old pack mule
And I made me a ladder from
A pawn shop marimba
And I leaned it up against
A dandelion tree

And I filled me a sachel
Full of old pig corn
And I beat me a billy
From an old French horn
And I kicked that mule
To the top of the tree
And I blew me a hole
'Bout the size of a kick drum
And I cut me a switch
From a long branch elbow

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six

Well I slept in the holler
Of a dry creek bed
And I tore out the buckets
From a red Corvette, tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Lionel and Dave and the butcher made three
You got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
With the strings of a washburn
Stretched like a clothes line
You know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six

Now I hold him prisoner
In a washburn jail
That stapped on the back
Of my old kick mule
Strapped it on the back of my old kick mule
I bang on the strings just
To drive him crazy
I strum it loud just to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'

Whittle you into kindlin'

Tom Waits,"I've come 500 miles just to see your halo
Come from St. Petersburg, Scarlett and me
When I open my eyes, I was blind as can be
And to give a man luck, he must fall in the sea
And she wants you to steal and get caught
For she loves you for all that you are not
When you're falling down, falling down
When you're falling down, falling down, falling down

You forget all the roses don't come around on Sunday
She's not gonna choose you for standing so tall
Go on take a swig of that poison and like it
And now don't ask for silverware, don't ask for nothing
Go on and put your ear to the ground
You know you'll be hearing that sound, falling down
You're falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down

When you're falling down, falling down, falling down

Go on down see that wrecking ball come swing in on her now
Everyone knew that hotel was a goner
They broke all the windows and took all the door knobs
And they hauled it away in a couple of days
Now someone yelled timber, take off your hat
We all look smaller down here on the ground
When you're falling down, falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down

Someone's falling down, falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down

Tom Waits,"She's my only true love
She's all that I think of, look here
In my wallet
That's her

She grew up on a farm there
There's a place on my arm where I've written
Her name next to mine

You see I just
Can't live without her
And I'm her only boy
And she grew up outside McHenry
In Johnsburg, Illinois","Johnsburg, Illinois",1988
Tom Waits,"She wore red shoes by the drugstore
As the rain splashed the nickel
Spilled like chablis along the midway
There's a little blue jay
In a red dress, on a sad night
One straw in a root beer
A compact with a cracked mirror
And a bottle of evening in Paris perfume
He told her to wait in by the magazines
He had to take care of some business it seems
Bring a raincoat and a suitcase
And your dark eyes
And wear those red shoes
There's a dark huddle at the bus stop
Umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet
Li'l Caesar got caught
He was going down to second
He was cooled
Changing stations on the chamber
To steal a diamond
From a jewelry store for his baby
He loved the way she looked in those red shoes
She waited by the drugstore
Caesar had never been this late before
And the dogs bayed the moon
And rattled their chains
And the cold jingle of taps in a puddle
Was the burglar alarm
Snitchin' on Caesar
Now the rain washes memories from the sidewalks
And the hounds splash down the nickel
Full of soldiers
And Santa Claus is drunk in the ski room
And it's Christmas eve in a sad cafe
When the moon gets this way
There's a little blue jay
By the newsstand
Wearing red shoes
So meet me tonight by the drugstore
We're goin' out tonight
Wear your red shoes",Red Shoes,1988

I believe that brandy's mine

Is best measured when its down
And I never buy umbrellas
Cause there's always one around

He rides through your dreams on a coach and horses
And the fenceposts in the moonlight look like bones

Well they've stopped trying to hold him
With mortar, stone and chain
He broke out of every prison
When the boots mount the staircase
And the door is flung back open
He's not there for he has risen
He's not there for he has risen

Some say he once killed a man with a guitar string
He's been seen at the table with kings
Well, he once saved a baby from drowning
There are those who say beneath his coat there are wings

Well, some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
But one look in his eye
And everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him

He can turn himself into a stranger

A fever beats in his head just like a drum inside

In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum, we call 'em as we see 'em

The dark horse will bring glory to the jailer and his men

And the madness of the crowd is an epileptic fit

In the colosseum, we call 'em as we see 'em

They're taking their ovations, the vultures stay behind

In the colosseum tonight

In the colosseum tonight

Tom Waits,"Well, the Ice Man's mule is parked outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf dances with the butcher's son
And tonight a little rain never hurt no one

Well, they're dancing on the roof
And the ceiling's coming down
And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
And a little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one

Oh, the world is round and so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going, it's worth the ride

She was fifteen years old
And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last thing she said
Was ""I love you mom""

And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no one

Tom Waits,"There was a murder in the red barn, a murder in the red barn

The trees are bending over and the cows are lying down
The autumn's taking over, you can hear the Buckshot hounds
The watchman said to Reba the loon
Was it pale at Manzanita, was it Blind Bob the coon?
Pin it on a drifter they sleep beneath the bridge
One plays the violin and sleeps inside a fridge
There was a murder in the red barn, murder in the red barn

Someone's crying in the woods, someone's burying all his clothes
Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer slept outside last night and froze
Roadkill has its seasons just like anything
There's possums in the autumn and there's farm cats in the spring
There was a murder in the red barn, a murder in the red barn

Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house or covet they neighbor's wife
But for some murder is the only door through which they enter life

Well, they surrounded the house, they smoked him out, took him off in chains
They sky runed black and bruised and we had months of heavy rains
Now, the ravens nest in the rotted roof of Chenoweth's old place
And no one's asking Cal about that scar upon his face
'Cause there's nothin' strange about an axe with bloodstains in barn,
There's always some killin' you got to do around the farm
A murder in the red barn, murder in the red barn

The woods will never tell what sleeps beneath the trees
Or what's buried 'neath a rock or hiding in the leaves
'Cause roadkill has it's seasons just like anything
It's possums in the autumn and it's farm cats in the spring
A murder in the red barn, a murder in the red barn

Now, a lady can't do nothin' without folks' tongues waggin'
Is this blood on the tree  or is it autumn's red blaze?
When the ground' soft for diggin' and the rain will bring all this gloom
There's nothing wrong with a lady drinking alone in her room
But there was a murder in the red barn, a murder in the red barn

There was a murder in the red barn, a murder in the red barn",Murder in the Red Barn,1992
Tom Waits,"One, two, three, four
Pale-face said to the eyeball kid
She just goes clank and boom and steam
A halo, wings, horns, and a tail
Shoveling coal inside my dreams
There are no laws
She's made of cream
She's such a scream

Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement
A Donnie gal from mortal clay
The plow is red, the well is full
Inside the dollhouse of her skull
A cheetah coat fills up with steam
She's such a scream

All crooked lines
Her fireplace
A milktrain so clean
Machine-gun haste
You'll ride the only wall of shame
And drag that chain across the state
Her lips are red
She is the queen
She's such a scream, aah
Hoo",Such a Scream,1992
Tom Waits,"Well there's one thing you can't lose
It's that feel
Your pants, your shirt, your shoes
But not that feel
Throw it out in the rain, you can whip it like a dog
You can chop it down like an old dead tree
You can always see it
When you're coming into town
Once you hang it on the wall you can never take it down

But there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
You can pawn your watch and chain
But not that feel
Always comes and finds you, it will always hear you cry
I cross my wooden leg and I swear on my glass eye
It will never leave you high and dry
Never leave you loose
It's harder to get rid of than tattoos

But there's one thing you can't lose, it's that feel
But there's one thing you can't lose, it's that feel
You can throw it off a bridge, you can lose it in the fire
You can leave it at the altar, it will make you out a liar
Fall down in the street, you can leave it in the lurch
Well, you say that it's gospel but I know that it's only church

And there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
It's that feel
You can't lose, and it's that feel, oh yeah
One thing you can't lose, and it's that feel
You can't lose, and it's that feel",That Feel,1992
Tom Waits,"I've grew up here all of my life
But I dreamed someday I'd go
Where blue-eyed girls and red guitars
And the naked rivers flow

I'm not all I thought that I'd be
I've always stayed around
I've been as far as Mercy and Grand
Frozen to the ground.
But I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave
So kiss me once and then
And I'll go to hell, I might as well
Be whistlin' down the wind

Bus is at the corner
The clock on the wall
The broken-down windmill
There ain't no wind at all
And I yelled and I cursed
""If I stay here I'll rust""
I'm stuck like a shipwreck out here in the dust

The sky is red
And the world is on fire
And the corn is taller than me
And the dog is tied
To a wagon of rain
And the road is wet as the sea
But sometimes the music from a dance
Will carry across the plains
And the places that I'm dreaming of
Do they dream only of me?
There are places where they never sleep
And the circus never ends

So I will take the Marley Bone Coach
And be whistling down the wind

So I will take the Marley Bone Coach
And be whistling down the wind",Whistle Down the Wind (For Tom Jans),1992
Tom Waits,"Well, they're lining up to mad-dog your Tilt-a-Whirl
Three shots for a dollar, win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell, I believed them so well
Take them back, take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
Oh well, I did my time in the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn

Tell me, what did you do?
What did you do the last time, why don't you do that?
Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend
Do you cry, do you pray, do you wish them away?
Are you still leaving nothing but bones in the way?
Did you bury the carnival, with the lions and all?
Excuse me while I sharpen my nails

And just who are you, who are you this time?
You look rather tired, are you pretending to love?
Well, I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go?
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?
Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes
You better get down on the floor, don't you know this is war?
Tell me, who are you this time?
Tell me, who are you this time?",Who Are You,1992
Tom Waits,"When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be
Than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world.
On October's last, I'll fly back home rolling down winding way
And all I've got's a pocket full of flowers from my grave
But now summer is gone I remember it best
Back in the good old world I remember when, she held my hand
And we walked home alone in the rain how pretty her mouth, how soft her hair
Nothing can be the same and there's a rose upon her breast
Where I long to lay my head and her hair was so yellow
And the wine was so red Back in the good old world.",Good Old World (Waltz) [Vocal][Version],1992
Tom Waits,"In the evening he stumbles home with his tie undone,
As the moon sweeps 7th avenue, as usual

I know your alibi
So don't make excuses
Those are tears in your eyes
And you're falling back
In love
Again
Now that Annie's back in town
Well it came down through the grapevine
It put your business on the street
I hear you've been hanging out till dawn
In some lunch room (somewhere)
Well you thought you've gotten over her
But that was till you found
That Annie's back in town
All the corner boys are all trouble-makers
And the sailors are all fools
Well it seems like some things round here

Tom Waits,"Small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight,
And nobody flinched down by the arcade
And the marquees weren't weeping, they went stark-raving mad,
And the cabbies were the only ones that really had it made
And his cold trousers were twisted, and the sirens high and shrill,
And crumpled in his fist was a five-dollar bill
And the naked mannequins with their Cheshire grins,
And the raconteurs and roustabouts said ""buddy, come on in, 'cause
Cause the dreams ain't broken down here now, they're walking with a limp
Now that small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight""
And nobody flinched down by the arcade
And the burglar alarm's been disconnected,
And the newsmen start to rattle
And the cops are telling jokes about some whorehouse in Seattle
And the fire hydrants plead the fifth amendment
And the furniture is bargains galore
But the blood is by the jukebox on an old linoleum floor
And what a hot rain on forty-second street,
And now the umbrellas ain't got a chance
And the newsboy's a lunatic with stains on his pants, 'cause
Cause small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight
And no one's gone over to close his eyes
And there's a racing form in his pocket,
Circled ""blue boots"" in the third
And the cashier at the clothing store didn't say a word
As the siren tears the night in half, and someone lost his wallet
Well, a surveillance of assailance, it that's what you want to call it
And the whores hike up their skirts and fish for drug-store prophylactics
With their mouths cut just like razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos
And her radiator's steaming and her teeth are in a wreck, and nah,
She won't let you kiss her, but what the hell do you expect?
And the gypsies are tragic and if you want to buy perfume,
Well, they'll bark you down like carneys, sell you Christmas cards in June, but
But small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight

No more chewing gum or baseball cards or overcoats or dreams
Someone's hosing down the sidewalk, and he's only in his teens, 'cause
'cause small change got rained on with his own thirty-eight
And a fistful of dollars can't change that,
And someone copped his watch fob, and someone got his ring
And the newsboy got his porkpie Stetson hat
And the tuberculosis old men at the nelson wheeze and cough
And someone will head south until this whole thing cools off, 'cause

Tom Waits,"Now, George was a good straight boy to begin with, but there was bad blood
In him; someway he got into the magic bullets and that leads straight to
Devil's work, just like marijuana leads to heroin; you think yo ucan take
Them bullets or leave 'em, do you?
Just save a few for your bad days

Well, now, we all have those bad days when you can't shoot for shit.

The more of them magics you use, the more bad days you have without them
So it comes down finally to all your days being bad without the bullets
It's magics or nothing
Time to stop chippying around and kidding yourself,
Kid, you're hooked, heavy as lead

And that's where old George found himself
Out there at the crossroads
Molding the Devil's bullets
Now a man figures it's his bullets, so it will
Hit what he wants to hit
But it don't always work that way

You see, some bullets is special for a single aim
A certain stag, or a certain person
And no matter where you are, that's where the bullet will end up
And in the moment of aiming, the gun turns into a dowser's wand
And point where the bullet wants to go

As the snake sheds his dove

So they'll fit into his glove

Blew me a hole 'bout the size of a kickdrum
And I cut me a switch from a long branch elbow

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six

Well, I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed
And I tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three
Well, you got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
With the strings of a Washburn stretched like a clothesline
Oh, you know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
Me and that mule scrambled right through the hole

I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six

Now I hold him prisoner in a Washburn jail
That I strapped on the back of my old kick mule
Strapped him on the back of my old kick mule
Bang on the strings just to drive him crazy
Oh, I strum it loud to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
Strum it loud just to rattle his cage

Oh, I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'

And dance around your bones

Tom Waits,"Well, Frank settled down in the Valley
And he hung his wild years on a nail that he drove through his wife's forehead
He sold used office furniture out there on San Fernando Road
And assumed a thirty thousand dollar loan at fifteen and a quarter percent
And put a down payment on a little two bedroom place
His wife was a spent piece of used jet trash
Made good bloody Marys, kept her mouth shut most of the time
Had a little Chihuahua named Carlos
That had some kind of skin disease and was totally blind
They had a thoroughly modern kitchen, self-cleaning oven, the whole bit
Frank drove a little sedan, yhey were so happy
One night Frank was on his way home from work, stopped at the liquor store
Picked up a couple of Mickey's Big Mouths
Drank 'em in the car on his way to the Shell station
Got a gallon of gas in a can
Drove home, doused everything in the house, torched it
Parked across the street laughing, watching it burn
All Halloween-orange and chimney-red
Then Frank put on a top forty station
Got on the Hollywood Freeway, headed north
Never could stand that dog",Frank's Wild Years,1998

Makes me wish that I could be a dog
Well, when I see the price that you pay
I don't want to grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't want to grow up

Seems like folks turn into things they they'd never want

I don't want to grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't want to grow up
I don't want to have to shout it out

I don't want to be filled with doubt
I don't want to be a good boy scout
I don't want to have to learn to count
I don't want to have the biggest amount
I don't want to grow up

Well, when I see my parents fight
I don't want to grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't want to grow up
I'd rather say here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't want to live in a big old tomb on Grand Street, hoo

When I see the five o'clock news
I don't want to grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't want to grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't want to put no money down
I don't want to get me a big old loan

It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream

That we would never part

In a pile of dead leaves

To linger longer
Stick your spoon in the wall
We'll slaughter them all

November has tied me
To an old dead tree
Get word to April
To rescue me

Made of wet boots and rain
And shiny black ravens
On chimney smoke lanes
November seems odd
You're my firing squad

With my hair slicked back
With carrion shellac
With the blood from a pheasant
And the bone from a hare

Of a roebuck stag
Left to wave in the timber
Like a buck shot flag

Go away, blow your brains out

Blow the roof off the goat barn let it roll down the hill

And a whole box of rebel and a bar of soap

That's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern
And he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed
A skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through a needle
In this sinking boardwalk town

She's my black-market baby (she's my baby)
She's my black-market baby (she's my baby)
She's a diamond who wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal

I swang out wide with her
On hell's iron gate
Anything that you wanted
You could have
My eyes say their prayers to her
Sailors ring her bell
The way a moth mistakes a light bulb
For the moon and goes to hell

She's my black-market baby (she's my baby)
She's a diamond who wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal

There's no prayer like desire
There's amnesia in her kiss
She's a swan and a pistol
And she will follow you like this
In Moberly, Missouri
At the Iroquois Hotel
She checked in with the President
And she ran up quite a Bill

She's my black-market baby (she's my baby)
She's my black-market baby (she's my baby)
She's a diamond who wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal

Well, she's whiskey in a teacup
She gives blondes a lousy name
She's a Bonzai Aphrodite
And a ticket back to Spain
She's a hard way to go
And there ain't no way to stop

Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the bible

At Zerelda Lee's candy store

Well, I've got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

Well, I don't want no Abba Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better
Suitable for this boy

Well, it's the only thing that can pick me up
It's better than a cup of gold
See, only a chocolate Jesus
Can satisfy my soul

When the weather gets rough and it's whiskey in the shade
It's best to wrap your savior up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy but that's okay
Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait

I made the kid a promise, I made the kid a vow
He's not conventionally handsome, he'll never be tall
He said, 'All you got to do is book me into Carnegie Hall'

Hoo, he's just a little bitty thing, he's just a little guy

The folks moved out of it a long time ago
And they took all their things and they never came back
It looks like it's haunted with the windows all cracked
Everyone calls it the house
The house where nobody lives

Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams, did they throw it away, did they know what it means?
Did someone's heart break
Or did someone do somebody wrong?

Well, the paint is all cracked, it was peeled off of the wood
The papers were stacked on the porch where I stood
And the weeds had grown up just as high as the door
There were birds in the chimney and an old chest of drawers
Looks like no one will ever come back
To the house where nobody lives

Once it held dreams, did they throw it away, did they know what it means?
Did someone's heart break
Or did someone do somebody wrong?

And the ring it fell off my finger

You waved your crooked wand
Along an icy pond with a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows I saw
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond
They spell Alice

I disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere across the sea
There's a wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass on the tide
And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby all I can think of is Alice

Arithmetic arithmetock
Turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat?
How did the razor find my throat?
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier

And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
And I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice
Of Alice

And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss

To get candy and we are alone in the house here
And your eyes fall down on me

And I belong only to you
The water is filling my shoes
In the wine of my heart there's a stone
In a well made of bone
That you bring to the pond

And I'm here in your pocket
Curled up in a dollar
And the chain from your watch around my neck
And I'll stay right here until it's time

The girls all knit in the shade
Before the baby is made
And the branches bend down
To the ground here to swing on

I'm lost in the blond summer grass
And the train whistle blows

Or does love lie bleeding in dreamland?

Is there a moonlight up ahead?
And if we are to die tonight

On the back of his head he had another face
Was it a woman's face or a young girl?

So poor Edward was doomed

It was his devil twin
And at night she spoke to him
Things heard only in hell
But they were impossible to separate
Chained together for life

Finally the bell tolled his doom
He took a suite of rooms
And hung himself and her from the balcony irons
Some still believe he was freed from her

I say she drove him to suicide

And from a window across the lawn I watched you undress
Wearing your sunset of purple tightly woven around your hair
That rose in strangled ebony curls
Moving in a yellow bedroom light
The air is wet with sound
The faraway yelping of a wounded dog
And the ground is drinking a slow faucet leak
Your house is so soft and fading as it soaks the black summer heat
A light goes on and the door opens
And a yellow cat runs out on the stream of hall light and into the yard

A wooden cherry scent is faintly breathing the air
I hear your champagne laugh
You wear two lavender orchids
One in your hair and one on your hip
A string of yellow carnival lights comes on with the dusk
Circling the lake with a slowly dipping halo
And I hear a banjo tango

And you dance into the shadow of a black poplar tree
And I watched you as you disappeared

Like the thistles that are growing
'Round the trunk of a tree 

All the good in the world
You can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me

If there's one thing you can say about mankind
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitch fork
But it always comes roaring back again

Misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world 

The higher that the monkey can climb
The more he shows his tail
Call no man happy 'till he dies
There's no milk at the bottom of the pail

God tempers all the ruins for the new shorn lands
The devil knows the Bible like the back of his hand
All the good in the world
You can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me 

If there's one thing you can say about mankind
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitch fork
But it always comes roaring back again

For want of a bird
The sky was lost
For want of a nail
A shoe was lost
For want of a life
A knife was lost
For want of a toy
A child was lost

And misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world
Everybody row! Everybody row!
Misery's the river of the world

Tom Waits,"You dance real slow
You wreck it down
Then you walk away you turn around
What did that old blonde gal say?
That is the part you throw away

I want that beggar's eyes
A winning horse
A tidy Mexican divorce
St. Mary's prayers, Houdini's hands
And a barman who always
Understands

Will you loose the flowers
Hold on to the vase?
Will you wipe all those teardrops
Away from your face?
I can't help feeling as I close the door
I have done all of this
Many times before

But the bone must go
The wish can stay
The kiss don't know what the lips will say
Forget I've hurt you
Put stones in our bed
And remember to never
Mind instead

But all of your letters burned up in the fire
And time is just memory mixed with desire
That's not the road It is only the map, I say
Gone just like matches
From a closed down cabaret

In a Portuguese saloon
A fly is circling around the room
You'll soon forget the tune that you play
Cause that is the part
You throw away
Oh that is the part
You throw away",The Part You Throw Away,2002

Tom Waits,"We put up our tent on a dark
green knoll, outside of town by
the train tracks and a seagull dump
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel
and her 'Marvellous Pigs In Satin'

We pounded our stakes in the ground
All powder brown
And the branches spread like scary
fingers reaching 
We were in a pasture outside Kankakee

And One Eyed Myra, the queen of
the galley who trained the
ostrich and the camels
She looked at me squinty with her 
one good eye in a Roy Orbison
T-shirt as she bottle fed
an orangutan named Tripod

And then there was
Yodeling Elaine the
queen of the air who wore a 
dollar sign medallion and she
had a tiny bubble of spittle
around her nostril and a 
little rusty tear, for she had
lassoed and lost another
tipsy sailor 

And over in
the burnt yellow tent
by the frozen tractor, the
music was like electric sugar
And Zuzu Bolin played
'Stavin' Chain' and Mighty
Tiny on the saw and he
threw his head back with a 
mouth full of gold teeth
And they played 'Lopsided heart'
And 'Moon over Dog Street' 

And by the time they played 'Moanin Low'
I was soakin' wet and wild eyed
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a 
preparation and I fell asleep with
'Livery Stable Blues' in my ear

And me and Molley Hoey drank
Pruno and Koolaid and she had a 
tattoo gun made out of a cassette
motor and a guitar string and 
she soaked a hanky in 3 Roses
and rubbed it on the spot
and drew a rickety heart and 
a bent arrow and it hurt like hell

And Funeral Wells spun
Poodle Murphy on the target
as he threw his hardware, 
Only once in Sheboygan did he miss
at a matinee on Diamond Pier and
she'd never let him forget it

They were doing two shows and she
had a high fever and he took
off a piece of her ear and 
Tip Little told her she should
leave the bum 
but Poodle said, ""He fetched me
last time I run.""

On the day after tomorrow

It is so hard and it's cold here

'Bout what it means to be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel 
'Bout all the blood that's been spilled
Will god on this throne
Get me back home
On the day after tomorrow

You can't deny, the other side
Don't want to die anymore then we do
What I'm trying to say is don't they pray
To the same god that we do?

And tell me how does god choose?
Whose prayers does he refuse? 
Who turns the wheel? 
Who throws the dice?
On the day after tomorrow

I am not fighting, for justice
I am not fighting, for freedom
I am fighting, for my life 
And another day in the world here

I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home
On the day after tomorrow

And the summer, it too will fade
And with it brings the winter's frost dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost here

Black cellophane sky at midnite
A big blue moon with three gold rings
I called Champion to the window
I pointed up above the trees

That's when I heard my name in a scream
Coming from the woods, out there
I let my dog run off the chain

It's worse than the time before

With boney, claw like fingers
A rusty black rake
Digging up the turnips of a muddy cold grey sky

Shiny tooth talons
Coiled for grabbing a stranger happening by
And the day went home early
And the sun sank down into the muck of a deep dead sky

Don't go into that barn, yea
I said: don't go into that barn, yea

Back since Saginaw Calinda was born,
It's been cotton and soyabeans, tobacco and corn
Behind the porticoed house of a long dead farm
They found the falling down timbers
Of a spooky old barn

Out there like a slave ship upside down
Wrecked beneath the waves of grain
When the river is low
They find old bones and 
When they plow they always dig up chains

A worn out car
And a wife who was leaving for good

Life's made of trouble,
Worry, pain and struggle

Lipstick on the glass
They must of left in the middle of the night

And I want to know the same thing
Everyone wants to know

Behind a smoke colored curtain, 
The girl disappeared
They found out that the ring was a fake

A tree born crooked,
Will never grow straight
She sunk like a hammer into the lake

A long lost letter and 
And old leaky boat
Promises are never meant to keep

And I want to know the same thing
I want to know

The barn leaned over, 
The vultures dried their wings
The moon climbed up an empty sky

The sun sank down,
Behind the tree on the hill
There's a killer and he's coming through the rye

But maybe he's the father, 
Of that lost little girl
It's hard to tell in this light

And I want to know the same thing
Everyone wants to know
How's it going to end?

Drag your wagon and your plow, 
Over the bones of the dead
Out among the roses and the weeds

You can never go back,
And the answer is 'no'
And wishing for it only makes it bleed

Tin horn prayers
Don't buy roses off the street down there
Took it all and took the dirt road home
Dreaming of Jenny with the light brown hair
Night is falling like a bloody axe
Lies and rumors and the wind at my back
Hand on the wheel gravel on the road
Will the pawn shop sell me back what I sold

I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I""m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond

Birds cry warning from a hidden branch
Carving out a future with a gun and an axe
I'm way beyond the gavel and the laws of man
Still living in the palm of the grace of your hand
The worlds not easy the blind man said
Turns on nothing but money and dread
Dogs been scratching at the door all night
Long neck birds flying out of the moon light

I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I""m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond

Smack dab in the middle of a dirty lie
The star spangled glitter of his one good eye
Everybody knows that the game was rigged
Justice wears suspenders and a powdered wig
Dark town alleys been hiding you
Long bell tolling is your waterloo
Oh baby what can you do
Does the light of god blind you
Or lead the way home for you?

I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I""m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond

God all mighty for righteousness sake
Humiliation of our fallen state
Written in the book of tubold Cain
A long black over coat will show no stain
Feel the heat and the burn on your back
The rip and the moan and the stretch of the rack
All my belongings in a flour sack
Will the place I come from
Take me back

I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I""m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond

They'll hang me in the morning on a scaffold yea big
To dance upon nothing to the tyborn jig
Treats you like a puppet when your under its spell
Oh the heart is heaven
But the mind is hell
Jesus of Nazareth told Mike of the weeds
I's born at this time for a reason you see
When I'm dead I'll be dead a long time
But the wines so pleasing and so sublime

I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I""m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond

Kissed my sweetheart by the chinaball tree
Everything I done is between God and me
Only he will judge how my time was spent
29 days of sinning and 40 to repent
The horse is steady but the horse is blind
Wicked are the branches on the tree of mankind
The roots grow upwared and the branches grow down
Its much too late to throw the dice again I've found

I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I""m gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond

I'm gonna wash them [2x]
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Father
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Mother
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Brother
Till the water runs clear [2x]

Get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren

Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday

I found it in the street
At first I did not see
Lying at my feet 
A trampled rose

Passing the hat in church
It never stops going around

You never pay just once
To get the job done

What I done to me, 
I done to you 
What happened to the trampled rose?

In the muddy street
With the fireworks and leaves

A blind man with a cup I asked
Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine'

It was the same

Another wrong goodbye and a hundred sailors

I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long I'll be dead

Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar
Skin was as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
Now I'll never see heaven or home

I made a wish on silver of moonlight
A sly grin and a bowl full of stars
Like a kid who captures a firefly
And leaves it only to die in the jar

As I kick at the clounds at my hanging
As I swing out over the crowd
I will search every face for Lucinda's
And she will off with me down to hell

I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I cast this burden on the god that's within me
I leave this old world and go free

The devil dances inside empty pockets
But she never wanted money or pearls
No, that wasn't enough for Lucinda
She wasn't that kind of girl

Now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda
Whoever thought that hell would be so cold
I did well for an old tin can sailor
But she wanted the bell in my soul

I've spoken to God on the mountain
And I've swam in the Irish sea
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges
And I'll beg there for mercy for me

I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I was standing outside the Whitehorse
Oh but I was afraid to go in

There was a smear of gold in the window
And then I was the jewel of her sin

Tom Waits,"The Whirligig Beetles are wary and fast with an organ to detect the ripples
The Arachnid Moths lay their eggs inside other insects along the borders of fields
Or roads in clusters of white cocoons
The Ribbed Pine Borer is a longhorn beetle
Their antennas are half the length of their body and they feed on dead red pine
Robber Flies, with their immobile heads, inject a paralyzing fluid into their prey
That they snatch from life in mid-air
The Snow Flea's mode of locomotion, strange and odd
With a spiny tail mechanism with hooks and a protracted tube from the abdomen
To enable moisture absorption

The female Praying Mantis devours the male while they are mating.
The male sometimes continues copulating even after the female has bitten off his head
And part of his upper torso
Every night wasps bite into the stem of a plant, lock their mandibles into position
Stretch out at right angles to the stem and, with legs dangling, they fall asleep

If one places a minute amount of liquor on a scorpion
It will instantly go mad and sting itself to death
The Bombardier Beetle, when disturbed
Defends itself by emitting a series of explosions
Sometimes setting off four or five reports in succession
The noises sound like miniature popgun blasts
And are accompanied by a cloud of reddish-coloured, vile-smelling fluid
It is commonly known that ants keep slaves
Certain species, the so-called Sanguinary Ants in particular
Will raid the nests of other ant tribes and kill the queen and then kidnap many of the workers
The workers are brought back to the captor's hive where they are coerced into performing menial tasks

And as we discussed last semester, the Army Ants will leave nothing but your bones
Perhaps you've encountered some of these insects in your communities
Displaying both their predatory and defense characteristics
While imbedded within the walls of flesh and passing for
What is most commonly recognized
As human",Army Ants,2006

Independent rear suspension,
Landau top, good tires
Gas hog.
I swear it had the power to repair itself

I love the old, Dan Steele used to give 'em to me at a discount
Showroom models and that

It just kinda handled so beautifully

They're always things it finds that shine. 
And how he'll find a shiny dime,
Silver twine, from a valentine. 
The crows all bring them shiny things. 

Leave me alone you big ol' moon, 
The light you cast is just a lighter.
You're like the crow, 'cause if it goes,
You're dressed to go, you guessed, I know,
You'll always bring them shiny things.

Is to be king there in your eyes.

Tom Waits,"The smoke from the battle fish and the rain soaked through
And the wheelman left the shore
And barns tumbled and silos flew across fifteen miles bad road tar
And big Bull Trometer hung on to the side
And the pig dogs trembled on Spidey's wild ride

And big John Jizom from downtown Chizom
Flew away with old mrs. Storm
And they found Bird Lundy neath a keg of nails crooked as a dog's hind leg
Keeping warm after twenty-nine days on hard assed bread
He drilled to the big outside and clung like a tick to his waterfront
Life mooned and clouded, blued and skied
And all the clocks blew up on Spidey's wild ride

And the hills stood up in a great big 3
And left me whipped by the forces that were inside me
Loud as the ocean, cold as a desk, red as the water on the river of flesh
And he was sewing up his pants while he was shoeing a mule
And he was bucking a head wind gale
But the crooked ass beauty was trapped to the side
And he shook on Spidey's wild ride

And all the statue ass makers, and the uprooted trees
And I shouted way up to where the rabbit digs his hole
And the wheelman, the jockeys the landlords and thee
Were bucking a head wind south
And with nine lives spent, he landed on his rent
Composed with a steele head salmon in his mouth
And I never did see another day outside

To purge us of the seven deadly sins

He's over on 18th street as usual
Lookin' so hard against the hood of his car
Puttin' out a cigarette in his hand
For all the pachucos at the pumps
At Romero's Paint and Body

They're all seein' how far they can spit
Well, it was just another night
And now they're huddled in the
Brake lights of a 58 Belair
And listenin' to how Romeo killed
The Sheriff with his knife

And they all jump when they hear the sirens
Romeo just laughs
""All the racket in the world ain't never gonna
Save that Coppers' ass
He ain't never gonna see another summertime
For gunnin' down my brother
Leavin' him like a dog
Beneath a car without his knife""

Romeo says,"" Hey man, gimme a cigarette""
And they all reach for their pack
Frankie lights it for him and pats him on the back
An' throws a bottle at a milk truck
And as it breaks, he grabs his nuts
An' they all know, they could be just like Romeo
If they only had the guts

Romeo is bleeding, nobody can tell
An' he sings along with the radio
With a bullet in his chest
An' he combs back his fenders
They all agree it's clear
That everything is cool, and if Romeo was here

Romeo is bleeding an' he winces now an' then
An' he leans against the car door
Feels the blood in his shoes
Someone's cryin' at the fire point
In the phone booth by the store

Romeo starts his engines
Wipes the blood off the door
And he brodys through the signal
With the radio full blast
Leavin' the boys there, hikin' up their chinos
And now they're all tryin' to stand like Romeo
With the moon, cut like a sickle
And they're talkin' now in Spanish, all about their hero

Romeo is bleeding as he gives the man his ticket
And he climbs the balcony at the movies
And he'll die without a whimper
Like every hero's dream
Like an angel with a bullet
And Cagney on a screen

But there's never a rose

Or a dream of lies

Is all that remains

And heaven is full

And we all gotta pull
And we're all gonna be

With nerves made of stone
He climbed the stairs
And the gallows groaned
And the people's hearts were pounding
They were throbbing, they were red
As he swung out over the crowd
I heard the hangman said
We're all gonna be...
Just dirt in the ground

Now Cain slew Abel
He killed him with a stone
They sky cracked open
And the thunder groaned
Along a river of flesh
Can these dry bones live?

Is we're all gonna be
Yea yea
We're all gonna be just

With dark and yellow gold,
I was 11 years old.
The inspiration was spread out like a blanket, ask em'.
My discovery was beyond the pick, the Lee suit, and the afro.
Now from the flair jeans on 169th and College.
Watching the dude lean on one-seven-o
With a Kangol 'cross America,
I saw the hippies cross.

The same time as the Beatles.
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed withJolly

All is forgiven.
Everything costs.
Deliver us from evil,
And carry your own cross.

I'm going away
I'm going away

The cradle wants a baby
Kitchen wants a pan
The heart wants a certain kind of lover if it can

The ocean wants a sailor
The gun wants a hand
Money wants a spender
And the road wants a man

I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
And I'll turn my back on you

Devil wants a sinner
The sky wants a bird
The table wants the dinner
Lips want a word

Glass wants the wine
Fist wants to hurt
Clock wants the time
And the shovel wants to work

Soldier takes a stand
The walls of the prison
Want a solitary man
The window wants a curtain
The plow wants the land
Diamond ring wants to
Fit upon the finger of her hand

You're better then all the rest

I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you'll meet up with a suicide bomb
Hell broke luce

How many ways can you polish up a turd

What did you do before the war?
I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Geoff, Geoff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left

Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin she said nope

When I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom she died and never wrote

Just before he died he had a toke

And I'm broke

Tom Waits,"The fire's dying out
All the embers have been spent
Outside on the street
Lovers hide in the shadows
You look at me
I look at you
There's only one thing
I want you to do

Kiss me
I want you to kiss me
Like a stranger once again
Kiss me like a stranger once again
I want to believe that our love's a mystery
I want to believe that our love's a sin
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again

You wear the same kind of perfume
You wore when we met
I suppose there's something comforting in knowing what to expect
But when you brushed up against me
Before I knew your name
Everything was thrilling
'Cause nothing was the same

I want you to kiss me
I want you to kiss me
Like a stranger once again
Kiss me like a stranger once again

Tom Waits,"I'm the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest
But they won't take me
I'm the last leaf on the tree

When the autumn wind blows
They're already gone
They flutter to the ground
'Cause they can't hang on
There's nothing in the world
That I ain't seen
I greet all the new ones that are coming in green

I'm the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me
I'm the last leaf on the tree

They say I got staying power
Here on the tree
But I've been here since Eisenhower
And I've out lived even he

I'm the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest but they won't take me
I'm the last leaf on the tree

I fight off the snow
I fight off the hail
Nothing makes me go
I'm like some vestigial tail
I'll be here through eternity
If you want to know how long
If they cut down this tree
I'll show up in a song

I'm the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest but they won't take me

Tom Waits,"The door was open, I was seething
Your mother burst in it was freezing
She said it looks like it's trying to rain
I was lost, I felt sea sick
You convinced me that he'd left
You said keep talking but don't use their names
I scolded your driver and your brother
We are old enough to know how long you've been hooked
And we've all been through the war
And each time you score
Someone gets hauled and handcuffed and booked

It felt like four in the morning
What sounded like fire works
Turned out to be just what it was
The stars looked like diamonds
Then came the sirens
And everyone started to cuss

All the noise was disturbing
And I couldn't find Irving
It was like two stations on at the same time
And then I hid your car keys
And I made black coffee
And I dumped out the rest of the rum

Nick and Socorro broke up
And Candice wouldn't shut up
Fin he recorded the whole thing
Ray he said damn you
And someone broke my camera
And it was New Years
And we all started to sing

Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne

I was leaving in the morning with Charles for Las Vegas
And I didn't plan to come back
I had only a few things
Two hundred dollars
And my records in a brown paper sack

I ran out on Sheila
Everything's in storage
Calvin's right I should go back to driving truck

Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne",New Year's Eve,2011

I said there ain't enough raised right men
It takes a raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said there ain't enough raised right men

Heavens to murgatroyd
Miners to coal
A good women can make a diamond out of a measly lump of coal
You need the patience of a glacier
If you can wait that long
Open up his window and admit it that you're wrong

Was a complicated man
He quarreled with his woman
And she quarreled with her man
His head was just too thick
So she knocked out a tooth
He's that lonely man on the turnpike in the toll takers booth

They're ain't enough raised right men

Gunplay Maxwell and Flat Nose George
Ice Pick Ed Newcomb on a slab in the morgue

Tom Waits,"When I'm gone
When I'm gone

Roll my vertebrae out like dice
Let my skull be a home for the mice
Let me bleach like the bones on the beach
I'll be hard like a pit from a peach
Now the ground has a branch
Now the hound has a ranch

The old tressel's just junk
The Edsel is on blocks
The old said so won't talk
I'm a blimp that's straining, cut 'er ties
I'm a moth in training, flutter by

Tom Waits,"Get a job, save your money, listen to Jane
Everybody knows umbrellas cost more in the rain
All the news is bad
Is there any other kind?
Everybody's talking at the same time
Well everybody's talking at the same time

It's hard times for some
For others it's sweet
Someone makes money when there's blood in the street
Don't take any lip
Stay in line
Everybody's talking at the same time

Well the dog is in the kitchen
And the war drags on
The trees wait by the freeway
All the money is all gone
Well she told me she would leave me
I ignored all the signs
And now everybody's talking at the same time
Everybody's talking at the same time

Ain't no one coming to pull you from the mud
You gotta build your nest high enough to ride out the flood
I know you're leaving and there's no more next time
Everybody's talking at the same time

A tiny boy sat and he played in the sand
He made a sword from a stick
And a gun from his hand
Well we bailed out all the millionaires
They've got the fruit
We've got the rind
And everybody's talking at the same time
Everybody's talking at the same time",Talking at the Same Time,2011
