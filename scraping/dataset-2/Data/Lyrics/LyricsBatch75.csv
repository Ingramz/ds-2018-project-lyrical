Color Me Badd,"Girl i can't believe,not in my wildest dreams
That you would do this to me
Thats why i'm standing here
Baptized in all my tears
How could you break my heart so easily
I gotta let you know
Thats not the way i flow
This thing is blowin' my mind
After all that we been through
How could you do what you do baby be so unkind


Chorus


How could this be
That you would just up and go away from me
How could you go
You got me feelin' like i'm kind of all alone
How could this be
That you would just up and go away from me
How could this be
You cannot tell me you did'nt know
I loved you so
How could this......
Ithought that we were both
Seeing eye to eye
How could you tell me that lie
That you were down for me
Like i was down for you
How could you be so untrue
I'm tryin' to figure out
What were you thinkin' 'bout
When you just walked out my life
Coz every day i still wonder
Would you be my wife so tell me....


Chorus


Coz girl i'm in a bad situation
So tell me what am i supposed to do
I don't have a clue what i'm facin'
I'm still in love with you
And every day i'm not with you
My heart is slowly breakin'
I don't wanna be right
When you always do me wrong
So why am i singin' this song


Chorus ",How Could This Be,1998
Color Me Badd,"Tell me, baby, do you know that I've tried
To show you how I feel?
Since your love has gone,
Yes, I know that you loved me when I left you
With tears in your eyes.
Now I miss your smile.
Yes I know, yes I know... that you're gone.

[Chorus]
Guess I've gone and done it again.
Truth is that I never thought I'd miss your love;
Now it's all I'm dreamin' of.
Watched my luck run out on a chance.
Now I see that life will never be the same.
I know I'll never love this way again.
Anything I'd do just to get down
And get it on one more time.
If just for a little while,
'Cause I know that the sun stopped shining
When your heart stopped beating with mine.
And I thought you knew
I'd never make it without you.

[Chorus]

Baby, I can't give up,
And I got to believe
I was a prisoner since you shined your light on me.
And now I've got to turn around
Until salvation is found.
I never imagined livin' without you.
Oh, I can't breathe without you, babe.
I'll never love this way again.
My baby's long, long, long, gone.
My heart stopped beating when
I lost her lovin' arms, but
From this day I ain't gonna stop believin', no,
'Cause you're the only one...
The only one, the only one I ever loved.

[Chorus]",I'll Never Love This Way Again,1998
Color Me Badd,"[Chorus]
It's gonna be alright.
Summertime, gettin' buck wild;
Kickin' it with the ladies, yeah, yeah.
It's gonna be alright.
Summertime, gettin' buck wild;
Kickin' it with the honies, yeah, yeah.
Everybody's got a wild side,
And what I got for you, girl, I just can't hide, no.
See, I been checkin' you out;
Time to make a move, mama, ain't no doubt.
Said we gonna have a little fun;
Put down the drop top in the summer sun.

[Chorus]
Now listen close to what we say.
In the ninety-eight we go all the way.
So hey, girl, what you want to do?
You can bring a friend; she can bring her crew.
Meet me 'round at the club, around nine;
Wear that red dress; you sure look fine.
Now all the summertime harmonies,
From the east and west, they all over me.
C-M-B, you know they my homies.
Now, pretty girl, come ride the pony, pony.

[Chorus]
It's that summer life,
And it's takin' me high.
We got this feelin' so right,
So c'mon, we gonna fly.

[Chorus]",It's Gonna Be Alright,1998
Color Me Badd,"Girl, I've been waiting
For, oh, so long now;
Just for this moment,
When no one's around you.

Just close your eyes;
Let me feel your breath against mine.
C'mon, now it's time.

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet love, I'm kissing you.
Oh, my love, kissing you, kissing you.

Lets wait for the chance, girl,
That we can escape;
Sneak out the back door, baby.
Ain't never too late,
So we can be alone just for a while.
'Cause a while is all I need.

[Chorus]

Oh baby, what's it gonna be?
You think you want to roll wit' me?
I'll make you say....
Oh, suga, the mood is right,
And my game is tight, c'mon.

[Chorus]",Kissing You,1998
Color Me Badd,"Don't throw your love away.
Right now you've got it made.
You've gotten' in over your head.
This isn't natural.
You got to close the door now.
They said we would fail,
But I just got to believe
I've tasted fear, and I had my share of pain.
Without my pride you know I'll risk everything, baby.
Every time I feel your touch
I want it over and over again.

[Chorus]
And now I can't let you go,
'Cause I can no longer hide.
I'm fallin' deeper inside,
And love is stronger than pride.
You've reached the end of the line,
And I will lay down my life,
'Cause love is stronger than pride.

With no beat in my heart;
Just runnin' from the dark,
And much too afraid to be sure.
I can't stand the pain of livin' life in vain;
A danger no longer this heart can endure.
Nothing is real if I can find your touch.
Walk though the fire; I know that won't be too much.
Every second I live; I promise you;
I need it over and over again, oh.

[Chorus]

I never believed this dying flame could ever burn again.
Now I will stand like a rock
Till there's no more to give.
Give up my life for that one chance to live.
(For) your touch in the night.
I can't let this die, oh, no.

[Chorus]",Love Is Stronger Than Pride,1998
Color Me Badd,"Nothing could be harder to believe
When you told me that you needed to be free(free)
I'm only getting by on memories
Hoping maybe time will help you see see

[Chorus]
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes (forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind( Ooh)
I've got nothing to lose, nothing to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dying inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when

I'm searching for the one abandoned dream, dream
(I need to reclaim)
Heaven's in the love
I cannot reach, can't reach (can't reach)
You know, I'm longing for the magic of your touch
And I thank God
I've never given up the chance to trust
You'd come back to me baby

Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes (I could see forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind(Ooh)
I've got nothing to lose, nothing to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dying inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when

Yeh, I know I'll be holding on to thoughts of yesterday
And this silence could fade away
I keep holding on to the times we shared baby
You know I'll never,never let you go let you go

[Chorus]

I could see forever in your eyes (forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind(Ooh)
I've got nothing to lose, nothing to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dying inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when",Remember When,1998
Color Me Badd,"I never really thought that this could happen
Me fallin' in love with you girl
We were always good friends
Now how do we ever start explaining
'Cause being my best friend
I know he wouldn't understand
Now how did we get this far
'Cause I remember all the things my mother said

[Chorus]
What's in the dark
Must come to the light
You know we can't go on
Livin' a lie
We can hide the truth and make believe
For only so long
Before they discover
That we're secret lovers
Now tell me what we do about our situation
Coz it's only fair that they both know what's going on
Now tell me what we do about our obligations
Before we both destroy our happy homes
Now how did we let it get this far
Girl i don't know but love has taken control

Chorus
You know we can't go on
You know we can't let it go
Although we've gotta try
Although faith ain't on our side
You know i'm feelin' inside
We can no longer disguise
We know they're gonna find out
We know without a doubt
The word is gonna get out

Chorus",Secret Lovers,1998
Color Me Badd,"If you don't mind
Don't tell me that lie.
I can see right through you;
Your expression tells me more
Than words could ever do.
I see right through you.

[Chorus]
Hit me off, sugar, don't run away.
C'mon, baby, it's written on your face.
No other love is ever gonna take your place.
C'mon, lady, it's written on your face.
If you don't show it,
Then how would I know it?
Mama, you can't let this slip away.
Now, why you keep runnin'on,
When what you want is right here?
Let love break me through your fears.
She's hot; she's fine.
She knows she got the whole world in her eyes.
She blows my mind.
The love's right here; she knows she can't deny.

[Chorus]

Every night, every day,
I long to see your love come my way, babe.
Don't deny; keep it real.
I need to know how you really feel.

[Chorus]

You want me I can see.
Plain and simple reality.
Baby, don't deny; keep it real.
I already know how you really feel.",Written on Your Face,1998
Color Me Badd,"Love was whispering my fate;
I heard it through your smile,
And now I get through everyday, baby,
Just to hold you at night.
There is no star out of my reach,
And forever's not too long.
Nothing is impossible, baby,
When I'm with you; when I'm with you.

[Chorus]
I can finally believe, now, without my pride.
When I'm reachin' out to love from inside.
And I could never be afraid with the comfort of
Your touch.
A thousand worries fade away
In the sweetness of your kiss,
And all the walls come fallin' down
'Cause your love is everything; everything to me.

[Chorus]",Your Touch,1998
Color Me Badd,"I have a plan, a woman and a man
Against the wind but living free
The price for love my life for thee
Don't run in fear, I need you to be here
I will climb the walls you hide behind
I will search the world until I find

I know that the ride we take
A life we'll make above the fears, beyond the tears
Happiness remains through the years

I can be the one, you know I can
When you're following me home, your heart in hand
Helplessly controlled to another land
To a place where lovers go

I see the light, endless in your eyes
Shining through, calling me, I forget the hurtful memories
Dodging the stars, to get where they are
They fought until they made it through
I will fight the same to arrive with you

Repeat
A companion and a friend, I will love you til the end
Til the end of time, through the years

Color Theory,"Overtime 
Home by nine 
Watch TV to loosen up my mind 
Pay the bills 
Earn a wage 
Just enough to keep it all the same 
Somehow life slips away 
Good or bad it's just another day 
On my own in this world 
Safe and sound 

But I don't want to stare out the window 
I don't want to stare all of my life 
Don't want to be afraid to remember 
What I might have dared 
What could be mine 
I don't want to stare out the window 
I don't want to stare all of my life 
All of my life

Back in my rebel phase 
I stood out in all the normal ways 
Held a dying man's faith 
That my art would be my resume 
But that man passed away 
Right or wrong it's not for me to say 
Here at home in my room

And that something is 
Supposed to happen now 
If it's all by design 
Keep on watching

Color Theory,"I hear you think about me now and then 
To fantasize about what might have been 
I’ve always been the one who got away 
The careless bullet tends to ricochet 

There’s virtue in the straight and narrow path 
And though you can’t afford the aftermath 
The rear-view mirror tends to draw the eye 
So sneak a peek now baby, don’t be shy 

But you say you’re happy 
So maybe it’s for the better 
But you say you’re happy 
To chauffeur these doubts forever 
Keep me in the backseat of your mind 

You’re driving under my influence 
Drunk on the thrill and deaf to consequence 
You know that I could make your life a mess 
And yet you chose to wear your tightest dress.",Backseat,
Color Theory,"They don’t know what they believe 
So we stare and nod as they think out loud 
Trying our best to fit in 
As we fight for breath in this stifling crowd 
And the time races by when you’re having some fun 
But it’s plodding along now at quarter to one 
As the night tries our patience we’re hitting a wall 
I slip off to the side like I’m taking a call to observe 

Extroverts at play 
Egos run amuck 
I’d like them well enough 
If they would just shut up 
But we will persevere 
By sheer force of will 
We’ll stoically endure 
This social overkill 

Tomorrow we’ll take the whole day 
To recuperate in a private place 
Sleeping or reading a book 
Our resilience now is our saving grace 
So just try to imagine, it’s not such a stretch 
I’m the life of the party and it is the death of me 
Here in my eyes you’re the belle of the ball 
With the hint of a smile you enchant more than all of the

Born of years perfecting intricate schemes 
If it works out this once 
We’ll be sipping margaritas in a matter of months 

Is it risky, maybe 
Is it legal, maybe not 
When your middle name is danger 
There’s no room for second thoughts 
If they catch me it’s game over 
If they don’t then we’re home free 

Is it theft? Well not quite 
Just financial sleight of hand when done right 
Take a look in the garage 
It’s equipped for simple hacking up to espionage 
I’m discreet, I’m covert 
And I promise that no one will get hurt 
I’ve said all that I dare 
To protect us both from jeopardy I’d better stop there 

It’s too late to turn back now

You’ve got to stop when I say when 
If you take this game too far 
I’ll never play with you again

‘Cause I like you a lot 
Can I trust you, or not? 

When your fingertips explore

As sensations in my skin

At a restaurant on the third floor 
You sat down across from me with a bottle of wine 
Shook my hand and started to pour 
Then opened the window to the music below 
A theater under the stars 
We shared our life stories and a view of the stage 
Falling in love from afar 

Though it feels like they’ve played out 
The same act a million times 
A routine struggling just to keep 
From falling asleep reciting their lines 
You say this is the way we’re meant 
To enjoy the opera 
At a safe distance 

We’ve met at this table now ten years in a row 
To see the same opera performed 
Recreating the scene down to the slightest detail 
The night our tradition was born 
Attendance is low but still the show must go on 
The participants gossip offstage 
The waiter assures us that the wine is the same 
I guess it gets bitter with age 

Though it feels like we’ve played out 
The same act a million times 
A routine struggling just to keep 
From falling asleep reciting our lines 
Still it makes me happy 
I love you at a safe distance 
I’ll always love you at a safe distance.",A  Safe Distance,

The song about a girl 
A tale of tragic glory 
To captivate the world

This isn’t a game 
I want to write a song and 
Sing it in your name but 
Who cares? I’ll recover 

I want to rip my heart out 
Throw it on the ground 
I want to scream your name out 
Just to hear the sound but 
Who needs another

Fill our dreams as we lie here together 
Too close, too close 

I broke out in laughter when you told me that 
Being with me is like being alone 
But I knew you meant it as a compliment 
This is what it means to be home 

Don’t allow yourself a single guilty thought

We know you've done it all before

Beneath the guilt you wore a pride in what you felt was honesty

I only ask one little thing 

Forget his mouth
Forget his eyes
Forget a thousand little lies
Forget you ever had a choice
Forget his name
Forget his voice 

I never claimed that I was perfect
I suppose it was implied
So were you driven to his arms by my imperfect sense of pride?
Or perhaps something you read
Or the way I made love to you desperately, desolately
I guess that you were desperate too 

I always loved the things in you that I could never be
But there must be a side of you I wasn't meant to see
Show me
Though my heart should be barren
Still my love for you grows
Like the weeds that destroy the flowers

That no one else really rings true for you 
I tell you it just wasn't meant to be

""Why can't we make believe? 
Start again, everything new"" 
But I won't see it through 

It could take a week to remember 
Why it never worked for us before 
We all stay the same on the inside

Colt Ford,"Yes I live in a single wide, to get up here it takes a four wheel drive
Got a mean old dog whose name is Sick 'em Sam

I got a motor hangin' in a tree,
A satellite dish, a trampoline
A sixty-eight red Chevelle, been known to raise a little hell
All night, bar fightin', some of y'all sayin' I ain't livin' right
Eat butter beans and fried spam
I ain't what they say I am

'Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer.
Though you might find an empty can of beer
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer, oh no
Since the day I threw you outta here

I burn my trash in a drum. Sometimes I shoot my gun
I'm mud boggin', camouflagin', a ball game is what I'm watchin'
I work hard, mow the yard, fish, hunt, knuckle scar,
Change oil, plow the soil, love a low country boy
I wear a suit for church and stuff, Daddy's the one that made me tough
He told me son, don't be ashamed of who you are and our family name
I'm makin' it proud, sayin' it loud, doin' my thing for the country crowd
I tell you the truth and don't give a damn
But I ain't what they say I am

'Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer
Though you might find an empty can of beer
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer, oh no
Since the day I threw you outta here

Go on and burn a little trash there for me boys

No there ain't no trash in my trailer
Though you might find an empty can of beer
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer, oh no
Since the day I threw you outta here

No there's no trailer trash livin' here

Colt Ford,"Thank y'all, how y'all doin'? Yeh, my names Colt Ford
I just came here to do a little song for y'all
'Bout where I come from, the way I see it
I brought my buddy, Mr. John Michael Montgomery with me
He's gonna play a lil' guitar and sing a lil bit
I'm gonna do a lil sumthin' for y'all
Called 'Ride Through The Country', let's go John

Down the road where the black top ends
You can find Colt Ford with all his friends
We're used to gravel roads, and fishin' with cane poles
Wasn't no swimmin' pools, just swimmin' holes

We was dirt road poor, and cane switched raised
I've been came a long way since back in the day
Been round the world twice seen all fifty states
Ate on thousand dollar china, but love some paper plates
There ain't nuthin' wrong with them big city lights
But me, I prefer them slow country nights
Where I can see the darkness come in and then go

Most folks is honest, and they all speak slow
You can leave your door open, ain't nuttin' gunna happen
Most country folks sing, but I couldn't, so I'm rappin'
I wanna show y'all where I come from
And invite y'all all down to any country town

Now before I pack my things and leave
There's sumthin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my life time
That's why I walk the line, I'm just a simple man
And not into things for cheep thrills
But all my scars heel, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from, you always will come
To take a ride through the country

Up, dressed, and gone by five am, he's country
And he's rappin' we gottas play him
Folks been waitin' for some one like me
To give 'em some hot beats and spit that country

My jeans don't sag, they fit, and kinda tight
Got on a white t-shirt, no nothin' but work
Daylight til dark, that's how I was bred
And I'll keep bein' country til the day I'm dead

See, country folks eat biscuits called cat heads
Bar-b-q, baked beans, sweet tea, and white bread
We like to fish and hunt, ain't scared of a fight
Love the good Lord and believe in doin' right,

Got four-wheel drives, some got mud on 'em
You can keep your Rolls Royce, 'cause baby
We don't want 'em! So now y'all all know exactly who I am
And if you ain't into that, I don't give a damn!

Now before I pack my things and leave
There's sumthin' I need y'all to understand
I seen a lotta things in my life time
That's why I walk the line, I'm just a simple man

But all my scars heel, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from, you always will come
To take a ride through the country

You might see my on your t.v, but honey
That don't mean a thing, you see
I'm still that same ol' country boy
And that's all I'll ever be, and sometime
Those bright lights blind me
And make it hard for me to see
But when I need to be reminded
I take a ride through the country

At about five o'clock on Friday afternoon
Them country boys head down to the local saloon
You welcome to stop in and have a cold bottle
Big city boys and stuck up super models
We don't care where ya from, as long as you polite
'Cause push come to shove and every one of us will fight

We mostly easy like Sunday morning, ol' Colt
Came here to give y'all fair warnin'
Country folks wont be pushed around
And there's some of us livin' in every town
We believe in the Bible, and the U.S.A
Work hard for what you want, it's the American way
Nobody owe you nothin' supposed to earn your keep
Put in a hard day's work, get a good nights sleep

I know some of y'all think Colt's kinda odd
But I'm loud, proud and country by the grace of God!

It ain't rained in a month
Mama done took a job part time at the five and dime

I ain't never seen him cry now I'm seventeen

To the prettiest little girl, green eyes and red hair.
I think I might ask her to marry me tonight at the fair.
I ain't never been so torn, should I stay or leave?
Get out of this small town, am I lettin' 'em down?
I could even play ball somewhere in the fall
Live the big city life, I guess I could have it all

Trying to figure out the right road to take.

Is it wrong to wanna leave the only place I've known?
Life as I know it is just simple and plain:
Chores, school, and practice, everyday is the same.

I'm tired of the routine and everyone knowing me.
I'm dreaming of everything the t.v. is showing me.
They promised me a full ride to UCLA,
But that's a whole 'nother world for small town G.A.

'Cause I'm torn between here and what I see over there
I pray someway that you could give me a sign
Tell me which way to go 'cause I sure don't know

I can finally see the ocean and stars of Hollywood
Say bye to this damn farm, get a tattoo on my arm
Forget these dirt roads and the way I was raised
Chase the bright lights of the California nights
Sports cars and sushi is all I see
When I order some sweet tea they start laughin' at me
Boy, this new life ain't what I thought it would be
Maybe the city life ain't made for me
Now I'm wishing I was fishin' on the lake with Dad,
And starting to realize being country ain't bad
I miss that ol' farm and that red headed girl
Waking up before the sun to help Daddy get it done.
I'm packed and headed back to the place I was born
Proud to be country and no longer torn

Layin' back  smokin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke blowin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
Memory Lane up in the headlights.
Got me reminiscing on the good times
Said I'm turnin' off the real life drive and that's right
Hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts' farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bon fire, then call the girls
King in the can, and the Marlboro man
Jack and gin were a few good men
We learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
It ain't as funny how rumors spread
Like I know somethin' y'all don't know
Man this shit is gettin' old
Man mind your business, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud ass out
No time for talkin' y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt road is what y'all missing

The way we were raised and our southern ways
We like corn bread and biscuits
And if its broke round here we fix it
See I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood or back in them woods
We do it different round here that's right
But we sho do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road and truck with four wheels
Jump on in, tell ya friends
That well be raisin hell where the black top ends

Hell yeah
I was brought up in a small town
??? raise on Southern Baptist morals
???
Praise the Lord y'all
Whoever learned to hump a fish
Bust a twelve gauge, pump and not miss
Life without working is just a myth
Never listen when they're talking shit
My dad taught me how to stand my ground
Be a man, boy, and never back down
Don't start something if he's talking trash
Better throw the first punch and whip his ass
Beat somebody and make a name for yourself
Life's hard, you go through hell
There comes a time when you've got to slow down
That's what we do

Growing up, I remember one year
My uncle Titus had a bright idea
He's gonna bottle up his own brew
He figured he could make a million or two
Taste wasn't gonna be his claim to fame
What he was banking on was all in the name

He called it Titty's, Titty's, Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinning ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One thing's for sure, everybody loves Titty's

He had his marketing plan worked up
He's gonna sell 'em all in big ol' jugs
He wouldn't package 'em in a 6 pack
He's gonna sell 'em by the pair and call it a rack
And he was sure it was the next big thing
With Dolly Parton in his ad campaign

Selling Titty's, Titty's, Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinning ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One thing's for sure, everybody loves Titty's

Somebody get a nipple for that thing

Happy hour, two for one
Talking 'bout a beer buzz, ooh, son
After work, at the ballgame and shooting a ball
Any time's the right time for a big ol' handful

And show this country girl what I got to give
My whole heap and hep of country fun,
Full of four wheel drive, dirt road and shotgun
Ain't nothing better than being out in the woods

Talk more proper when the city folks greet us

Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live

Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord,
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in a Ford, and we travel on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks

A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime

To mama's home cookin' and dad
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sitting on a tailgate,
Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

When I think about how it used to be, Lord it was so simple then
Dirt-bike and a fishin' pole at a fishin' hole with all my friends
Nothin' better than a BB gun in my backyard just huntin' squirrels
Took a ring from my mama's drawer and gave it to this little girl
Her mama called mine and then my daddy had to have a talk
I remember like yesterday what he said when we took that walk
""Son don't you ever tell no lie, even if the truth burns""
Everyday my mind goes back to all those lessons learned
And I wanna go

Back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries, nobody in a hurry and back
To mama's home cookin' and dad
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sitting on a tailgate,
Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

I remember that Texaco that Mr. Logan used to own
They turned it into something else and Mr. Logan's long gone
My best friend David, he grew up ridin' in that wheelchair
Thought I'd give a million bucks if that old boy was still here
Ain't it funny how time goes by and memories seem to fade away
They built a parking lot on the baseball field we used to play
That skating rink is closed down, but now I see us back again
I remember those all night skates, very first dates and my old friend

Back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries, nobody in a hurry and back
To mama's home cookin' and dad
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sitting on a tailgate,
Thinking 'bout those days just
Wish I was
Back

My dad's gettin' older now but son he's still as tough as ever
Him and my little boy are best friends now, wish it could last forever
My mama is still the one I talk to when I need advice
She never ever let me down
God what will I do when she's not around

Where the yellow pines grow tall
Rusty Diggs and Sandy Sam
Had a round-up camp last fall
They had their ponies and their running irons
And maybe a dog or two
And they 'lowed they'd brand every lop-eared calf
That came within their view

Well many a lop-eared dogie
If he didn't hush up by day
Had his long ears whittled and his old hide scorched
In a most artistic way
Then says Rusty Diggs to Sandy Sam
As he throwed his seago down
""I'm tired of cowbiography
""And I figures I'll go to town""

They starts her in at the Kentucky Bar
At the head of the Whisky Row
And they ends her up at the Depot House
And forty drinks below
Then he winds her up and they turns her 'round
And they goes her the other way
Tell you the Lord-forsaken truth
Them boys got drunk that day

Well, they was a-headin' back to camp
And a-packin' a mighty good load
Who should they meet but the Devil himself
Come prancin' down the road?
And the Devil he said, ""You cowboy skunks
""You better go hunt your hole
""'Cause I've come up from the Hell's rim rock
""To gather in your souls""
Says Rusty Jiggs to the Devil
""Though I know we're tight
""No devil ever took no cowpunch
""Without one kind of a fight""

So Rusty Jiggs punched a hole in his rope
He swang it straight and true
He lassoed it onto the devil's horns
And he's takin' his dallies true
Now Sandy Sam was a reata man
With his gut line coiled up neat
So he shakes her out and he builds him a loop
And he lassoed the Devil's hind feet
They stretched him out, they tailed him down
While the irons was a-gettin' hot
They cropped and swallow-forked his ears
And they branded him up a lot
Well they pruned him up with a dehorning saw
Tied knots in his tail for a joke
Then they rode off and left him there
Necked up to a black-jack oak

So if you're ever up in the Sierry Petes
And you hear one hell of a wail
Know it's that Devil a-bellowin' 'round
About them knots in his tail
You'll know it's that Devil a-bellowin' around
About them knots in his tail",Tying Knots in the Devil's Tail,

On the trail to a kill to feed my existence
That's where I first picked up the scent to her
Wanted her for my own after the kill

And it was the first blood that we tasted together

We were wild dogs

We'd roll amongst the sweet grass lickin' on each other
As the night replaced the day we'd bay and howl at the moon
We'd lay down and we'd listen to the silence of the stars
Shootin' 'cross the universe for us to see, her and me

We were wild dogs

We'd go runnin' through the forest with the grace of an eagle
With the freedom of the wind and the strength of our youth
Just like our old friend the Indian, we'd only kill to feed ourselves

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1988

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And, to add to the show
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love! 

Margie and Pat:
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird 
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

Columbia Symphony Orchestra,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining. 
'Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

O night, O holy night, o night divine!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. 
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land. 
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger, 
In all our trials born to be our friends. 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
And in his name all oppression shall cease. 
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

Une colombe, une kalash sur l'étendard
J'suis dans un mauvais mood donc l'album sera dark
On a gravi montagnes, cailloux dans la sandale (dans la sandale)
C'est pour nos p'tits qui font des crises d'angoisses
Solitude dans la foule, on est mille dans la place
Nos histoires sans thème, vos messages sans réponse
Des bouquets par centaines, qui fanent sur des tombes

1000, j'ai mille problèmes, sur scène on est mille
J'me sens seul quand même
Les lumières de la ville m'appellent
J'veux pas briller, merci quand même
T'aurais du t'taire, nous on y est
Visière devant les yeux pour pas croiser d'regards
Laissez-moi tranquille en pleine mer sur ma barque
On s'vengera dans mille ans (dans mille ans)

J'me sens plus proche du Ciel dans ma tour d'ivoire

J'regarde le compteur d'abonnés s'envoler
On fait du stop sur la route du succès
J'ai pris l'volant, le chauffeur roulait beaucoup trop lentement
J't'arrache les vêtements dans la forêt
La peau de tes lèvres entre mes dents
J'ai promis pour la vie, ça durera quelques temps
J'suis d'vant mon ordi' quand tu pars en vacances

Il reste une place vide à côté d'moi dans ma fusée
Cultive les fleurs maladives
Une colombe, un lâché de fusil
Regarde mes chrysanthèmes
Brise en deux ta carte SIM, moi j'brise la mienne
Brise ta carte, regarde mes chrysanthèmes

Et j'vois les Hommes les yeux qui saignent

On s'abandonne dans la rave
Collés au mur dans l'arène

Les enfants te mentent pas
J'te vois faire les cents pas
J'suis en bas, pourquoi tu n'descends pas?
Pourquoi le week-end tu sors pas?
J'veux pas sortir sans toi

Le jour s'efface, la nuit s'écrit
L'problème, c'est qu'j'veux pas dormir seul
Que j'fréquente tout le temps
Les mêmes amis, on sort en ville
Quand est-ce qu'on arrêtera de boire?
Et qu'on s'dira les choses en face
Pour combattre l'ennui
J'suis un stratège comme Napoléon
Le monde est p'tit, on en fait le tour en une seule nuit
Seuls, dans dix ans on s'marie
J'lirai même pas mon propre livre
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour vivre?
Connaître un milliard de vues, un milliard de rues
Un milliard de moments perdus

Mets la fête sur pause faut qu'on cause
On s'explique en buvette, on déballe
On s'écarte de leur groupe
Ils nous ressemblent pas
Le vent nous porte à contre-courant dans la foule
Y'a qu'ma bite qui fait la nuit debout
On manquait de rien, on manquait de tout
Perdu dans le dernier wagon du dernier métro

Jette moi tous tes problèmes à la figure, j'les avalerai
Tu peux m'écouter en vrai, enlève tes écouteurs
J'viendrai t'chercher à l'heure, j'vais pas te laisser toute seule

Ivre mort dans ses bras, elle me protège
J'peux pas t'ramener chez ma mère
Elle dit que c'est pas un hôtel
J'veux m'envoler d'ici comme Bruce Wayne
Dans un nid de chauve-souris
Comme un frisbee au-dessus des barbelés
C'est toujours à moi d'aller vers eux
De forcer les rencontres et le courant nous emporte
T'attendais la buvette pour avouer tes sentiments
Depuis l'temps que j'attendais ce moment
Mais tu vois pas qu'on vole au-dessus d'un nid d'rapaces
Qu'il n'y a plus de place dans leurs soirées
Qu'ils nous laisseront jamais rentrer
On longe les murs sans âme
J'vais dormir seul, encore une fois
J'rêve d'un royaume où on est rois
J'rêve d'un royaume où on est rois

J'veux qu'tu saches que
J'voulais t'dire que je crois que je t'aime
Que j'oublie peu, Qu'les années passent sans dire adieu
On pointe nos armes sans ouvrir feu
À tout à l'heure ou dans mille ans
J'fais l'tour du monde en ambulance
J'entends tes pleurs sur l'répondeur
Tu m'cherches dehors, comme le bonheur

Sortir le soir, ça sert à rien à chaque fois
J'préfère charbon chez moi
Pour ça que le week-end je sors pas
Ils disent qu'ils traînent en bas de la tour mais j'les vois jamais
Tout le monde ment, personne ne traîne en bas la journée
Les chiens m'aboient dessus quand je traverse la rue
J'suis pas l'bienvenue ici
J'veux fusionner la nuit et l'après-midi
T'es dans ta bulle, j'vais la crever, yo
Nos rêves changent leur programme télé
Viens on part, on s'évade
T'inquiète pas, les nuages masqueront les orages
Le temps d'une balade sauvage

On quitte la piscine pour l'océan
On prend l'autoroute la plus proche d'ici
Participe, j't'en prie
Prends le volant, je porte tes valises
Tes valises, tes valises, tes valises
Ton sac à dos, ta sacoche
C'est pas l'temps qui nous emporte
C'est une Porsche en vitres teintées
Pour mieux apprécier le paysage
Laisse les petits gérer les rains-té
La voisine s'occupera du chat
Est-ce que tu crois qu'il est jaloux de toi?
On fera l'amour sur l'champ de bataille
Enlève l'épouvantail dans ton jardin intime
J'décortique ta peau pour avoir le noyau
J'porte le bendo sur l'dos comme un escargot
Fais demi-tour au prochain virage
Y'a qu'mon ego dans l'histoire
Nos filles seront les femmes qu'on aurait voulu avoir
Nos filles seront les femmes qu'on aurait voulu avoir
On est des caméléons devant le miroir
Des lucioles dans la forêt noire
Pardon papa, maman, mais j'veux pas faire les mêmes erreurs que vous
Putain c'est fou, on a les mêmes goûts
Y'a qu'tes lèvres qui n'ont pas les mêmes rêves
On vient au score, on est menés dans la partie
Le film de notre vie fera des millions d'entrées
De janvier à décembre, on pourra se baigner
La descente aux enfers, commence à freiner
Tu lis un roman sur un transat
J'suis au studio, j'assure les transactions
Pour le shopping, trois grands axes
Tu tournes la tête, j't'embrasse la joue dans la tentation

Et on reporte notre évasion dans dix ans
Quand on aura plus rien à perdre
En attendant, nos vêtements sont trop différents des leurs
On s'fond dans le décor, on leur fait peur
T'es pas comme eux, cherche pas à l'être
La fenêtre ouverte, les oiseaux nous regardent baiser
La beauté du monde dans les transitions
Entre les positions, les rotations de ton entrejambe
Dans ma chambre, le lieu du crime
Où l'enfant est mort d'impatience
On construira une banlieue rose
Où même les femmes seront dangereuses
On choisira jamais notre camp
Change de veste, de chemise, comme un caméléon
Ton porte-monnaie, à moitié plein ou à moitié vide?
Personne le sait
Pourquoi le weekend tu sors plus?
Personne le sait
Si on s'est vus cette nuit?
Personne le sait
Les gens qui ne s'ennuient pas sont inintéressants
Ils veulent faire comme leurs parents
Nous, on est dans l'train du turfu
J't'envoie des messages à rallonge, t'es déjà convaincue
Toutes les femmes de ma vie discutent dans un même lit
Elles soufflent sur des bougies
Mais les années sont des incendies
Les incendies? J'les éteins pas, j'les laisse brûler
La moindre mélancolie me fait hurler
On s'oublie pas
Aucun de mes amis d'enfance ne connaîtra le succès
On s'oublie pas
J'suis obligé de quitter la ville pour m'faire sucer
Si on est seuls dans dix ans, on s'retrouvera
Sinon, et bah, on s'oubliera
Notre paradis est à deux pas
Reste en buvette, j'irai sans toi
As-tu vraiment besoin d'ce diplôme pour avoir confiance en toi?
Si j't'aide, c'est uniquement pour mon plaisir
Le pire de mes souvenirs est le plus joyeux des tiens
Au final, j'vais bien
Quand j'reste chez moi, quand j'pense qu'à plaire
À mon miroir
Comme quand j'regarde dans tes yeux
J'ai fini le jeu à 100%
Allez, dispersez-moi tous ces enfants
Aux quatre coins du monde
Quand ils se croiseront, ils se reconnaîtront
Dans la foule, comme des caméléons

L'temps d'écouter un album en entier
J'aperçois mon chat écrasé au milieu d'la route

La caravane est trop petite, Alakazam comme seul ami
Maman m'fait subir son mode de vie
Et au collège, parait qu'ma veste pue la merguez
C'est pas d'ma faute, c'est le feu d'bois qui nous réchauffe dans le salon
Et mes ch'veux longs, maman m'dit qu'ils sont beaux
Quand est-ce qu'une fille d'mon âge me dira-t-elle : ""Foda t'es trop mignon""?
J'suis un chien bâtard qui fait la chasse aux papillons
J'fais des pompes et des abdos au milieu des feuilles mortes
Dans ma horde idéale, les femmes sont bien meilleures que moi
J'aime bien cette fille, coupe au carré, qui porte un t-shirt Nirvana
Comment lui faire enlever son casque pour lui faire écouter ma voix?

Mes potes n'aiment pas manger tout seuls au self, perso' j'm'en bats les couilles
De toute façon, impossible de leur parler du film que j'ai vu avant-hier
J'leur fais des blagues, c'est tout c'que j'sais faire avec eux
Me presserai pas pour être premier d'la queue leu-leu
C'est impossible, ces sales babtous n'ont jamais vu un noir
J'ai 13 ans mais j'suis sur que j'éduquerai mieux qu'eux leur progéniture
Premier jour en sixième, on m'traite de mouton
Deuxième jour : j'parle plus, j'ai compris la leçon
J'ai attendu 21 ans avant d'savoir comment aimer une fille
Avant d'croiser la vérité j'pensais avoir tout compris dans l'passé
J'ai l'impression de devenir comme mes parents
De réaliser leurs rêves inachevés et c'est marrant
J'comprends qu'maintenant c'qu'est une bonne baise
J'm'étais trompé sur moi-même
Ma man, ils ont fait d'toi un monstre
Du collège au bendo, j'voulais une carrière de cinéma
Mais j'vais m’inhiber dans tes bras
À quoi bon être adulé par un public qu'on n'aime pas?

J'passe ma main dans mes longs ch'veux blonds, les mêmes que Kurt Cobain
J'porte mon sac à dos comme la misère du monde dans la cour du collège

J'passe ma main dans mes longs ch'veux blonds, les mêmes que Kurt Cobain

Les lignes du terrain d'foot qui s'effacent
L'absence du paternel, angle mort au fond du préau
Des insultes sur les mères gravées au compas sur les tables
Des copies pleines de fautes
La peinture de hall qui se barre
Le décolleté d'la plus bonne de la classe
Sur qui j'me branle de mémoire tous les soirs
J'en veux un peu à mes rents-pa parce-que j'suis moins riche que mes potes
Et comme le temps passe, j'me suis entraîné à mettre une capote
Mais elle veulent pas nous faire la bise ou nous convier à leurs soirées
Bienvenue dans la pire équipe du pire collège de la ville
Là où une fille dans les chiottes s'est faite violer
Ça bégaye devant la CPE
Ça s'prend au jeu, met des claques derrière la tête du gars qu'personne aime dans la classe
Ça pourrait être moi mais faut pas s'mettre à sa place
Après les cours y'a une bagarre et j'voudrais pas louper ça
Aujourd'hui ça m'concerne, ils m'attendent à la sortie avec une barre de fer
Viens devant chez moi en début d'aprèm, sonne pas, mon daron fait la sieste
Y'a un gars qui peut m'avoir de l'herbe, vole une cigarette à ta mère
On a laissé les BMX au sol, au skate-park on boit d'la bière
Les passants nous prennent pour des cas-sociaux
J'allume la mèche, j'me brûle

Sac de couchage sur la plage
J’te prends en stage dans mon gang
Ton prénom coule dans mon sang
M’sieur l’agent, j’vends la Kush
L’argent coule dans ma poche
Ils m’trouveront pas dans ma cachette
Coupe la pastèque à la machette
On achève bien les chevaux
Pisse mon âme dans tes cheveux
Monte sur mon dos comme un paresseux
Baignade en mer par temps neigeux
On tue l’temps par pendaison
Là où j’vais y’a pas d’réseau
Des jolis crabes dans l’seau
J’vous emmerde et j’rentre à ma maison
Et dans ce torrent de vœux lents j’emporte avec moi
Tous les artistes de mon baladeur MP3
Mes carnets, mes écrits, mes rêves, mes cauchemars
Le mépris, la parole, la misère, les histoires
Une télé allumée, des grands-parents muets
Les vêtements délavés, la neige à Noël
La solitude du mois d’août, les parents divorcés
Et les allers-retours, et les allers-retours, et les allers-retours
Et les allers-retours entre la plage et ma femme
Le bendo et la casa
Survole la Terre comme la NASA

J’trie mes billets par couleur
Si j’gagne, c’est toi qui pars
Mélodie mortelle, prête un écouteur
Tout s’paye, ne l’oublie pas
La naïveté dans son bonheur
La vérité et sa douleur
J’fabrique une cabane sur la plage
J’pense à des corps, j’en oublie les visages
Le bruit d’un suicide puis le silence
Le froid du Uzi contre ma hanche
Dans les roseaux, le sifflement du vent
Un couteau dans ma poche pendant l’état d’urgence
En été, le sommet d'la montagne enneigée
Elle s’réveille en tee-shirt et cheveux emmêlés
Mes parents méritent mieux qu’un loyer modéré
J'les fuck tous et j’repars, l’air de rien
T’étais heureuse, pourquoi tu me l’as pas dit?
J’paye le voyage à mes sous pour la Suisse
En bas, ça tire sur des joints d'shit à fond
Tant qu’il y aura du malheur, y’aura d’l’inspiration
J’peux pas t’laisser partir dehors, il fait trop froid
J’préfère le ciel, la nuit, la pleine lune, les étoiles

Comment c’est loin, prend tes jambes à ton cou
Ici et là, on se retrouve
J’t'ai pas rappelée, mais j't’ai pas oubliée
Fais tourner la manette à la fin d’la partie
Éclaire le bout du tunnel, j’hypnotise mon petit monde
Saut de l’ange au bout du pont
Les démons au bout des lèvres, ma balance, ma calculette
Roule le cadavre dans la serviette
Avant d’te tuer j’te dis : « Qu’est-ce que t’es belle »
J’me tire vers ma crique (on s’reverra plus)
À chaque pas une nouvelle marche
Tu m’as sali, donc j’me détache
Merci, de rien, lâche-moi la main
Poursuis ma route en sac à dos
Ma condition, tous mes cadeaux
D'été en hiver, pas un rayon
P’t’être j’en rajoute, j’en ai plus rien à foutre

J’fais et j’refais les cents pas
On s’mélange au paysage
Descends la dune en Vélib’
Oublie les tunes, on est libres
Des grains d'sable dans l'canon du fusil, un grain d’beauté sur sa fesse
Elle m’dit qu’on est amis, t’as cru qu’ça m’intéresse?
On baise où tu veux
Devant la mer, on devient vieux
Y’a trop d’personnes qui m’doivent des sous
Elle était bonne, mais je m’en fous
On est venus en taxi, on repart à la nage
On a quitté la ville pour vivre sur la plage
On joue à cache-cache avec les gens
J’me tatoue pour faire passer le temps
L’amour est d’passage
Il t'aime car t'avales
Un cauchemar où je travaille
J’veux plus répondre aux messages
Jette ton portable à la poubelle
J’fais plus les même erreurs
Non, j’veux en faire des nouvelles
J’pense que j’lui plais
L’argent panse les plaies
On fait l’amour sous l’tonnerre
J’marque du poteau d’corner
Arrête de crier, personne vient t'chercher

Un paquet de cigarettes partagé à plusieurs
Enfermé dans ma tête pour écrire un chef-d’œuvre
On se reverra jamais, on parle pendant des heures
Je fais que taffer, amoureux d'une droguée
La santé ça va, j'ai rien à raconter
Je réfléchis à deux fois sur le chemin du tabac
Je regrette mon logo, je regrette le FAMAS
Trop occupé à sortir de la misère
On a laissé nos femmes baigner dans la rivière
J'aime les plans cul dans mon imaginaire
Un besoin d'amour difficile à satisfaire
La tête ailleurs avec elle dans le passé
J'attends tomber les fruits tout en haut du pommier
On scroll à l'infini les rêves réalisés
J'aurais plus qu'à niquer
J'ai pas envie de parler les bras croisés à table
Capuché dans la rame, schizoïde évitant
Dépendant, angoissé, enfermé dans la cage
J'veux une maison de campagne et une vie idéale
Seul et mal accompagné
J'ai grandi, j'ai craché au visage des lamas
Des mégots écrasés sur la route du bonheur
On a pris des couleurs, enfermés dans la mine
Je me sens déjà trop vieux pour percer dans la vie
On raccourcit nos blagues, on rallonge les ""je t'aime""
Bien plus heureux avec plus de problèmes
J'bats des ailes tout en haut du totem
Sans lendemain la fête n'a aucun sens
J'veux une vie d'adulte, j'ai pas eu d'adolescence
J'reviendrai justifier mes absences
Ma parole est d'or, mes promesses dorment en silence

Même Dieu n'réponds pas à tes questions
Avant d'partir en cavale, finis tes révisions
J'ai pas de souvenirs de ma vie d'avant
J’arrêterai la visser, attends
J'fonce tête baissée comme un tricératops
À cause de moi, t'es accusé à tort
Pourquoi tu fumes? Pourquoi t'achètes?
Tu te détruis le cerveau
Comme un poisson rouge dans un verre d'eau
Trois barres de réseau et tu réponds pas
Ils sont chez moi, ils sont chez moi
Jette les talkie-walkies par la fenêtre
Tôt ou tard, ils vont m'avoir
Dénonce-moi, te prend pas la tête

Maintenant l'soleil j'voudrais l'éteindre
C'est fini, ils vont m'emmener
Un joint d'pollen pour me détendre

J'suis sur écoute, prends le deuxième talkie-walkie (Prends le deuxième)
T'es OK? OK, On s'retrouve au parc, over over, (over over)

Hola qu'est-ce-que ça d'vient? J'refais les riens, j'refais la science
Une balade, dans la ciudad, pas loin des reins si proche des hanches
Loin des soucis de la France, France-France, t'es pas libre, t'es juste en vacances
Compte sur tes doigts pas sur la chance, tout droit tête baissée fonce, fonce, fonce
Regarde vide et sourcils froncés, j'suis comme toi, toi j'me sens seul
Au fond des abîmes comme si j'avais pied, j'suis comme toi, toi j'me sens seul
Comme toi, toi j'me sens sale
Insensé comme ma défonce, comme quoi ça fait pas tout, t'inquiètes j'attendais pas d'réponse

J'accuse le coup, j'accuse le destin
J'suis pas fou mais j'suis pas certain
Là j'perds pied dans le pétrin
J'cours après ta fierté
En vain, vain, vain, brille comme Philippe Plein, Plein, Plein
Ou comme flaque sous un lampadaire
À un point où on n'peut plus perdre
Noyé dans le grand bain, bain, bain, fan
De ces petits riens, serrez fort, ces petites mains
Encore un effort, j'suis au fond j'ai mis les formes
Le maléfice, le mauvais sort bloqué dans un mauvais corps
Tu touches un peu, un peu et encore
Comment ça pas dans la norme? Tu m'l'offres et puis tu l'emportes
Dans les rues ça sent la mort, ne comptez plus sur moi pour que je vous porte
Pour que je vous borde
Pour que j'ouvre porte
Dans ma tête le bordel

Columbine,"À chaque album, une fille qui va, l'premier cri avant la révolte
Simple comme un cœur qui bat, j'suis la grêle avant la récolte
Ma dernière chance au bar-tabac, on pleure comme des saxophones
Ils traînent ensemble quand t'es pas là
Rejoins nous, on part sans eux
Dans le noir, t'es ma lanterne à la lumière, t'es mal en point
Fais la photo, fais la photo, école, accord parental
Part en tournée comme en guerre, main d'argent et masque en fer
Peinture fraîche masque misère, tout perdre au test salivaire
Certifié grâce à Deezer tu m'as dit ""c'est facile à faire""
Tu l'as pas fait, c'est bizarre, j'reste à Rennes mais y a rien à faire
Est-ce que je peux sampler vos pleurs? Si tu t'en vas, j'suis solitaire

J'dois couper du bois pour crafter mon bouclier légendaire

Qu'on m'identifie partout pour un rien

Deux nuits d'moins qu'Nicola Sirkis, mon cerveau fait un court circuit

Regarde focus sur ses cuisses qu'elle frotte entre elles
Pour que sa culotte descende
La colombe renaîtra d'ses cendres
Et je sais même pas si j'regrette
Tu t'es fait avoir par ma gueule d'ange
Avec deux doigts j'écarte le store et j'guette

Échoué dans le décor après ce que j'inhale
J'ai flashé sur sa poitrine, sa nuque et sa taille
Éclaté dans le bain, je fais des pâtes, file en vitesse, change de sapes
Je veux la peindre, ou la photographier sous absinthe
Ouah! Elle m'a tranché à la gorge
Je l'espionne comme un fantôme à la morgue
Elle voit un Van Gogh ou un Manet, des poèmes et des pavés, oh-oh

Enterré dans ma tête, magnifique sur-cadré par la fenêtre

Accrochée au barreau, allongée sur le bureau

Sensuelle, heureuse, coupable

I live for now because my days is numbered
I got a six shot revolver, watch the barrel on my gun turn
I'm like an accident just waitin' to happen

It's pitiful this game is too political, critical
But let's not talk about the big I's and the little you's

And pistol whippin' niggas and flippin' niggas

Now wonder if this life fit us in Vegas with strippin' white bitches
But that's just a deep thought in the back of my mind
I'm Black Trash true to the streets gritty and grime
I got a bone to pick a holdster with a shoulder grip
Concealed inside my leather camouflage so I can ride, notice it?

Don't tell nobody, but between me and you I put three in you
Add you and ya crew to the M E N you
I got bloopers of ya death and I draw it myself

Kill a nigga over nonsense for five cents

Yo breath stank that cause you be talkin' a ton of shit

You can't take me out, forget about it
Killers in front of ya house, forget about it
Y'all niggas don't want no war, forget about it

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

For they both have the very same sensation

Burst right through you,
And makes a hole in your soul.

And as a soldier of misfortune and ultimate doomsayer;
I want you to feel,
And I know you will,
And everything you see will bleed straight through reveal the truth.

I never tried to get it,
I never tried to fit in,
And now I'm falling through.

Bait I'll throw you to my,
Slaves that stick to my lies and everything is shallow.

I am a demon today,
We're all demons today
We drown in soil we're flooded
As it happens,
I'm still trying to be human,

And this torment won't be through till you let me spend my life making love to you day and night, night and day.

Like the tick tick tick of the stately clock as it stands against the wall. 
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops when the summer shower is through.

Sous le ciel gris de villes grises
Qui brisent mon pauvre coeur

Jamais d'espoir, jamais de joie
Notre âme ploie en sa douleur

Fermons les yeux, que tout s'efface
L'espace, redevient bleu

Dans l'infini qui tire le soleil d'Afrique,
Sur les tropiques luit sous le ciel d'Afrique,

Chaque instant semble meilleur qu'ailleurs
Et pour nous tout est désir, plaisir, au pays ensorceleur.
Son appel magique fait surgir devant nos yeux  des jeux,
Et des danses où toujours l’amour ,
Met son rythme plein de feu.

Une voix en moi s'élève
Et sans trêve, elle dit :
Tu ne dois chercher ton rêve
Loin du ciel de ton pays.

People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits

From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride

And I pull the shades so I won't see them seein' me

Commander Cody,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,1990

But I go back workin', come Monday mornin', I'm right back with the crew

Throw my bills out the window, catch me a train to another town

Down in the corner was this real sharp cat
Had a 300 dollar platform shoes and a 100 dollar cowboy hat
He was standing on the curb by a fancy Buick down the floor
And this voice from inside says ""Come on sugar, let's go""

I hate to get heavy but listen to this

I ate some fish 'n' chips, I felt okay
I passed by a fancy cafe
I saw a man eating one of them T-bone stakes
He hollered, gracious stand by the side feeling him, Lordy

Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,1990

Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said ""aces is full pal how about you?""

So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet

And when you let me go you led me into...

To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too

Down in the Human Zoo

I want to come home to you

Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday

To man is a voice to sing
And some do so well
A voice of golden silk it seems they have
But hearing all none can compare
With one who sings beyond the air
A sound so real
My very mind his voice did heal

The day he sang it was so pure
A sound so clear that I've never heard before
A sound that's refreshing to the soul of man
Lord here I am please sing again

To escape from the cares of this life I need
To hear you sing over and over
Through your song we all shall live

It seems today some sing
About almost anything and there is no life
With just a rhythm and a rhyme
But if man would take the time to hear
Then tears of joy they all could feel
And love they'd find
To last forever throughout time

But they won't hear
They'll just ignore
A song that says that you're knocking at their door (you are knocking at their door)
And they would come in and they could dine with you
And you would also sup with them (you would come in and sup with them)

A song of your word that puts life in men
To help them stand for you much bolder
This is the only way that we can live

In a time when man's heart cries in search of an answer to a deeper need
If your voice they could only heed
Then and only then would they hear you sing
A song of your love where you died to save
And now you sing so they can live, oh lord

To escape from the cares of this life I need
To hear you sing over and over
A song of your work that puts life in men

Common,"feat. Kanye West, The Lost Prophets
Verse 1:(Common)
Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
We know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't know and they goes
The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

Hook:
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggaz rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?

(Spoken: Lost Prophets)
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and
? profiles ??

Verse 2: (Common)
Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype
Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?)
Its steep life, coming up where niggaz is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong 'cause its hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

Hook
(Spoken: Lost Prophets)
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Verse 3: (Common)
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is
Its so hot that niggaz burn to live
The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
Its so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

Hook
(Spoken: Lost Prophets)
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner",Corners,
Common,"[Chorus - Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

[Chorus]

[Verse - Common]
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems


Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Kanye West]
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

[Verse - Common]
I break bread wit thieves and pastors, OG's and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin it, yo that's man-slaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar, on the side making a few dollars

So I take time
Out my day
To pray and I say
Now I lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep
My soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old
And it's a cold cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma
It's the same routine
Keep my room clean
I'm lookin' to do some new things but ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life
I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel
Disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness
Alright you sing, I may not be the darkest
Brother
But I was always told to act my age and not my color
Knowin' that my color was that of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes get up stand up,
It's like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain
When it rains it pours, and it's about to come down hard
Thank God I found you
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance
From all angles
I tangle
For cash
Hopin' it'll last
Til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return to the arab
And on the way back
I stop and the liquor store
Grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't want to stop
And I can't turn around
Brew, I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up
My liver I burn it up (Fat line)
 
It's my life I live it up
The cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one way street and I done passed fun day
Three blocks ago
It itself life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' how come
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin
But I'm a couch bum what makes it bad I had incentive
But I disintegrated
To a state that's stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated
Or blowed
Ain't dealin' with a full deck and any day I could fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my concentration
In this idiotic nation
They say become I doctor, but I don't have the patients/patience
Adjacent
To that situation
I want an occupation
That I'm into
'Cause yet if I begin to
Live to my potential
I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience
I reminisce and wish
I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just sunshine
But now it's like I'm gettin' older to so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest
In peace
Of mind
And find
Who I am
But thank God I found you",Book of Life,1994

And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
To the beat ya'll and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, ya'll and you don't stop
Yes yes ya'll and you don't stop
And to the beat Com sense'll be the sure shot
Come on

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressing hippie
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hitting switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and ""real"" she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
I see niggas slamming her, and taking her to the sewer
But I'mma take her back hoping that the shit stop

No time to get all excited, just write it

Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain til I'm out of your system

The winner of the bread, precede your thoughts
'fore they come into your head (yo kid kinda nice!)
From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise

And then fight the night
With a light to gain sight make your competition say AIGHT

I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys

But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MCs that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?

I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in

""Go head, go head"", cause I gots the cuts like Bobby, rappers are dickheads 
Choppin' they demo, I do it like Big Red

I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks 
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back

But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork? 
I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought

I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it 
Regardless of the odds of how hard

The idiot vibin' I'm the comma comma Chameleon 
I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray 
It had maxed I was with bitches that had coochie 
Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters looking harder than niggas 
Hoes wore clothes that exposed their figures 
Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come 
Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one 
We come to the get together with whatever 
You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together 
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to 
The next cue, let's do it again y'all 
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold 
The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town and shorties we run round 
Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now 
And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town 
Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair

I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style 
Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats 
And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines 
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme 
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop 
Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot 
Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion 
Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5 
Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket 
Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet 
Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties 
Would be hot as hell and house stud would get ""Find a body!"" 
Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare 
I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there 
Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes 
Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop 
With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division 
(I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work 
Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tone master 
I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster 
Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap 
You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act 
What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit 
Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full 
My drink there was Boons and Red Bull 
I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool 
I thought I was cool, with my ""members only"" and a bold fade 
Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade 
And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags 
Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas 
And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call 
When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie 
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot

Common,"[Pops]
Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrestle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999 
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to G
I've love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here 
Talking about how nice is they ice 
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture, beat that neighborhood 
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
 
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new,
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the underground railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's hear
T dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree with The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left 
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I turn to the musical stylings of a Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Betty
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor t
Oh all my children",Pop's Rap,1994
Common,"I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
That be scattering
Over the global my vocals be traveling unraveling my abdomen
It's slime that's babbling grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madeline was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believing everything I'm reading
But my brain was bleeding, needing feeding and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, cause I was guilty in a sense

I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruising Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it

And I'm gone with the storm",Resurrection,1994
Common,"Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Groove is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a massouse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
When it's time for some action I get Red's ""Tonight's the Night""
An eye for an eye, a life for his wife
Dissected I'm on some hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm with the fam and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit I'm the locksmith
Started a missionary way on my life, the mic I rust like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that are remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the viles
Anti-Nazi when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest because I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the go rapper
I want to bone Jada Pinkett and that hoe Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't

Sometime when I'm alone in my room I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with the stolen card the credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Nevers going to get it""
 
Nevers too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like 'Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!'
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew that be giving us sweet and buying us fruit
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out because they look
Rest in peace to Heavena, washing tons of rappers like Booker
Tee told me 'You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world'
How you going to come off with the style that's thorough?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on

My foundation is in black block of niggas that rock they hat cock
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap, now get your glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rat race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before dinner I was getting big dog like Glen Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta get off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I write rhymes on the incline
Splat guts plus fat nuts and lay up like a crib line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one

For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
Psss, I'm only bugging
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
And picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time
To waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
To an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free, you want some flyer to read
Then buy from me

In your life if you get one

This is not the bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with fros
Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers
Players with plats studs with stockin caps I be rockin raps
Til I collapse
Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps

Hi see, I'm free at last
I'ma free man, free as the world be
And like an early bird, I'm special

It stems back to the roots of being true
It's gonna get me Me, you just get you You
What I look like, talking about some shit I ain't do?
I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody
I ain't kill nobody, it wasn't us it was THEM!
The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to sho-gun
It takes one to know one, and no one can tell me
How to be, cause I'ma be me, aight?
Cause I'm a man, now check it

Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling!
When I'm chilling at the flat, looking at the wall
Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit
On the mic I be talking shit
But some say my talk don't make no Sense
I'm trying to make the Dollars, my momma told me
To go to school and be a scholar, but school ain't for me
So don't even go there, I'm coming out of nowhere, to go where
Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark/arc, on the shot
But now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South, and fell in love call me love
Cause love is gonna getcha I'ma getcha
I'm like B.J. my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya
Styles from East to West, all across the country
I'm like that big fat woman cause cats want to bump me
I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster
But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love!
I love my music, I love my momma
I love myself, I love you, and you love me
And this is, I'm out

Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
Probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six million ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
Stir my style crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when I wreck it other rappers be like ""whiplash!""

It's like I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper
I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer
If Barry White was in the mob
I still would be deeper
Cause I had lyrics back when I used to run with Keyvin
MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like ""What's up?""
I said, ""You know you done fucked up
Now I'm sayin, ""You know you done fucked up""
Everybody that hear me say I'm jams like the NBA
Cause I'm on fire
If I was a Michelin I wouldn't tire
It's funny how time flies
Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say ""True""
They see you and be like ""Fiction""
I want 'spect and dead presidents
Like Richard Nixon
I'm a coach not a player
Not a gay mc, I'm straighter
My style is similiar to AIDS
You can f with it now
But catch you later
You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro
I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo'
Just chillin'
Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace

Get on the mic talk about cars and clothes
Sounding like hoes
Ain't been exposed to the foes,the moes, disciples
I'm from the state that is Ill, the rap son of man
Rotated down to Phil, to say what I feel
Get it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh
War, going on between the West and the East
Of the land, niggas don't own a piece
Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air, if you the true and living
Beware, the new world order, the devil's new religion
Sent my homey to the number two division
Sellin bootleg movies, got my VCR on a ove' smove'

Expose how they was average

The rock was typed graphic now watch the mic blast it
Shootin at the stars with emphatic rap static
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin back at it
The Lieuten-ant, the ele-phant, sippin automatic
Mic, rippin asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggas is livin highly medicated
I Used to Love Her but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated hated and very debated
For every career created was eliminated
And that's the way the balance of yin and yang related

Every Block is divine
Niggas swing on in a safari
Wild niggas, like I'm high on latari
Some let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see
Get out the city for a sec be at the places I be
Hey, I'mma be back on the deck, opening
Business in places for you to cash your check
My, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs, and still get had
The sad part about it niggas had houses on the lake
They tryin to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate
Call each other cuz cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow-ups, is how niggas communicate
Harmonizing through beeper and reefer
The city got my peoples in a sleeper, talk is getting cheaper

You reside, you're not even a man

But I will, cause my man said Soul for the life 
You cried ""Keepin it real"", yet you should try keepin it right 
That's understanding microphone mathematics 
Which leaves the currency in temporary world status 
And when one shows he posed threat to this one 
This one will make that one into none

We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather

But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly

One Day It'll All Make Sense, by me
What I want to do to you nah, really it's for you
Is open my mental window, hoping that you would climb in
Or if not, at least look in
I want to take you to places that I have been and to 
The places that I want to go. I mean this music
It ain't all that I got, but it does mean a lot to me
I injected my whole being into it, and I've been doing it for a while
It's like my whole life has become a style
I want to get into it yeah",Introspective,1997

On a Quest for Love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her
It's a cold world and niggaz need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat 
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribblin freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seemin contagious
Redeemin the ancients with ace this rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you chartin, certain shit I can't honor
 
It ain't that you sellin, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform fly-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollerin at the brothers, either you gon be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land, I can see my man Rashad
As he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked wit him

I said it's here

And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't ""F"" with me
Stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who want to battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch

""Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron""
""I ain't scared of no nigga""

I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion
Like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

""Fucking with Canibus""

Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get bitten with venom
From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the Shroud of Turin
For certain, I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as
You gay ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
WWW dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
That was sweating me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get them to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, coming to see you

It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

This some shit that I wrote, legendary like the goat
Who got game?
Giving a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album, niggaz was expectin, now my water broke
Before it, I was sorta broke
Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope
On a curry goat, like flu stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short a rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'ma hold shit down like syndrome

Rarely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga, get gone

Common,"It's a frantic situation

Extra salty cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with the Mo
If it was them, soon I'mma collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or them other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty dishes is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out

Kenny is our Moses in this five on five Exodus 
For the game of life full courts ain't preppin us 
Schools want me but the ghost of Manigault haunts me

The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options, no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure, cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline

Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening

Yo, on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they bust strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

So, wack niggas be cool, with them, I stay cordial 
Flowing room temperature, cats is presumed miniature 
Like golf. Soft like Tiger Woods 
And real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric 
Don't need to rob banks with dike broads to Set it

Yo, Terror Squad, Pete Rock collabo' 
From git-go, yo yo 

Aiyyo it's such a shame 
all these dick riders tryin to corrupt the game 
But what it bring, nuttin but pain 
and one in your fuckin brain 
Ain't nuttin changed since the album I'm still whylin 
I'm still violent I've been waitin for this moment 
like Phil Collins, for all my life I've been trifer than trifer 
Hyper than hype, when fightin to fight 
It's like, tonight is the night 
And I ain't even tryin to let a nigga slide 
I've been dyin to get a gat 
I dared to try now prepare to die 
I rush your crib like Jehovah's Witness, blow up any 
soldiers, infants, hold up, did you notice my heroic entrance? 
I'm so relentless in this field of rap, everything is real in fact 
Fully backed by bullies who be peelin caps 
I sack the rapper like li-nebacker, play my rhyme backwards 
you can hear the Devil speak his mind with fine graphics 
Things get drastic, Express for my plastic 
I pack clips, between my nuts and my fat dick 

[Chorus: Pete Rock] 
Grab ahold cause you never heard a 
verbal murder like this 
Cash comes before soul, so watch your shit 
Every cat want to be enormous 
Plottin on the next one 
Murder one (repeat 2X)

Aiyyo my whole circle, make you feel it like The Color Purple 
My niggaz comin through and still hurt you 
Wipe why'all Kleenex cats who stay full of germs 
We hit Fifth Ave, while why'all still hit Stern's 
Don't really care bout why'all, really hear bout why'all 
Yo on our side we do our thing, play the cut 
let the phone ring, Pete Rock connect team 
From M-V to L-see, my thugs straight thuggin it 
Snatchin niggaz out of the booth, unpluggin it 
Strange Fruit, my niggaz live to shoot 
Yo it's a strange thing, a nigga never had a suit 
Yo so bust what happen, remember the unknown's a clap-man 
Cat stackin, move out the hood that's in Manhattan 
Got big headed, misleaded, then dreaded 
Yo the beef deaded, his whole squad afraid to set it 
Yo I heard son, son is rockin iceberg Dunn 
Got up out the hood, wouldn't believe that, this cat would 
Head mad swollen, flamboyant this man golden

He was FUCKIN wit me, I ain't no duckin emcee 
With the knowledge there's a little thug blood in me 
This stud bumped into me, beef it was fin' to be 
My Appetite for Destruction is finnicky 
He was an industry type, influenced by magazines and snipes 
Rocked Adidas but he had no stripes 
I could tell in high school that he had no fights 
Hold dick better than he hold mics, he spiked his punchlines 
with current events, called for backup 
like one time when he heard it was Sense 
that deliver words with intents to kill 
Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel 
I peeled some raps back, that peeled his cap back 
Fucker thought I was Abstract, now his life is backtracked 
In the center of the party his crew identified the body 
Left him signin the wait-list sayin, ""I can't take this 
fake shit"" (echoes)

Common,"Yo
Truth had me up against the ropes 
And semi-conscious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
Watchin' the clock is ill when, faced wit the truth
Parallels observing, amateur video tapes of
Twenty-one top notch NYPD cops get ill
Fill they minds not to kill still son, never revealed
True feelings, we speakin' on the truth right now in itself is a healing
See The Creator, created existence and balance
At right angles, unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word false opposite of truth off course
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path, enabling truth
To stay stable and cling to earth!
Sorta similar to the way static electricity sting see
Truth brings light, light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never clearer
The truth is that you ugly, not on the outside
But in the inside on the outside you frontin' you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well-hidden
But when you in denial of self it is forbidden, that's the truth

In due time we will find

Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle, where must one go
To find it, time is real, we can't rewind it
Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
We find kids speakin' 'cause it's naturally in us
But the false prophets by tellin' us we born sinners
Venders of hate, got me battlin' my own mind state
At a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga
If it's only one, then why should it differ
So constantly I seek it
Wonderin' why I gotta drink a six pack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive, 'cause niggas got to live
Said I got to get more than I'm given
'Cause truth'll never be heard in religion
After searchin' the world, on the inside what was hidden
It was the truth

Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
In due time, we will find

Check it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses
The truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis
The truth is my crew is the smoothest bits of saliva juices like the roots is
More organic than acoustics
Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death, unless
The way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
'Cause the truth give the words away to the planet goddammit
I ran wit what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be the bring the light to the dark, breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth (why?) 'cause we keep marchin' on (True)
The truth lay the foundation of what we rockin' on (True)
You can't see it if you blind but we will always prevail (True)
Life is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail
And in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men
If ever crushed in the earth, we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was movin too fast, yaknawimsayin?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see em
My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em
Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em
Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em
Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the you-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I'se a little snot-nosed
Rockin Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes
Learnin the ropes of ghetto survival
Peepin out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
When it came to gettin mine I ain't tryin, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you

Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, trickin off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losin weight, not picky - with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggaz she know is dirty
Havin more babies than Lauryn, she started showin early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testin me
In _Retrospect_ I see she brought _Life_ and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes

Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo 
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears 
The way I freak funk oh the monkey's sayin', ""Hell yeah"" 
Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks want to cuss 
On how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess 
But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight 
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake 
Back to our regularly scheduled program, program 
I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, bam, I slam 
Like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian 
Cause see I want it quiet in here
I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomas's 
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises 
To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors 
I'm tired of seein these non rappin' dancin motherfuckers 

""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""

For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold 
And reach a large scale, sellin' for the pale male 
And I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail 
And stop drinkin' ale, the booty probably smell 
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid 
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid 
Got doo doo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass 
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache 
I must ask what's goin' on with rap, white kids actin black 
It's like McDonald's sellin' fatback 
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dance tracks 
I'm hearin' rap from Anthrax, my time the Caravan cracks 
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter 
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer 
I'ma shoot a dis well like a fist to all these wack groups 
Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops 
I'm wonderin' how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far 
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R 
Or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles 
But you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours 

""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" 
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""

It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker 
Think of that I boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta 
Is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin' to a stunk 
If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk 
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff 
It's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the 
Presents 
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff 
I'm a nigga with soul, my last name should be Smith-sonian 
I'm gassin' girls heads, just like petroleum 
Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian 
And turn off the lights this is the likes of a 
Ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother 
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter 
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her 
Never go pop I'm not a two liter 
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow 
Whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto 
Wear em? No, share em? A hoe 
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro 
Cause you-A-see is family, much tighter than foundations 
That holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution

Common,"Though the times are getting wicked I'm older
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintaining, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an artist see
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it 
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next accounted by the press
Mad stress on my chest 
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On ""Any Given Sunday"" I got to play my best

[Chorus]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight, 
everything will be all right on any given Sunday
The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose, 
you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Strive to achieve and die for what you believe


On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded,
No defensive they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me 
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Chorus]

Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame can be as painful as
Death of patron
Young black, gifted
But I'm rapped in myself
Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars fell
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
As long as we play well they love us
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money
I know that on Any Given Sunday 
This can be taken from me 
But it all comes down to is money why'all

[Chorus x2]",Any Given Sunday,2000

Doo doo doo, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Doo doo doo, diggy-doo yo

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling

Common,"(Yeah for your nation... 
For your nation...) 
Verse One: 
A bitch nigga wit an attitude named Cube 
Step to Com wit a feud 
Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast 
You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 
Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East 
On the dick of the East for your 1st release 
Your lease is up at the crib house niggaz get evicted 
And videos wit white boys talking you get Wicked 
Natural Born Killa, nigga you natural born God 
Look, read listen, got the nerve to say you rob 
Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your Death Certificate 
Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 
Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October 
Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 
Rap career is over, better off acting 
What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10 
You backed in to a four corner hustla 
Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her 
Use Higher Learning, don't take my words out of text 
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX 
It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back 
From giving you mouth shots or hit wit the pipe Ralph got 
When sucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good 
I wasn't salty, she was wit the Boyz N the Hood 
Chorus: 
I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind 
The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lyin 
I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you find 
The bitch in you but yo it's coming out 
Verse Two: 
Up on this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 
I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse 
This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above 
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love 
There's a thin line between the fake and the real 
Grafted ass nigga, I see through your Glass Shield 
Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo 
I'm a have ta wreck a Ho'shea 
I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 
(So what) so I had to slap her, ugn 
And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew 
Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
I seen you, you ain't say shit to ATL 
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell 
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 
A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 
Guess you knew you're shit was done plus the one got you cable 
Hoo Bangin, you ain't banging shit but the table 
And the Circle Madd, ain't got no choice but to fight 
Ain't none of y'all muthafukas got a chance on the mic 
Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you 
Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you 
Any last words before I hit the switch 
From the immortal words of one, a bitch is a bitch

Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yup, stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw something down whenever my dick's out

They know me from Washington to down south
All the way to London to my nigga Common house

Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreaming when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doing this shit like dude in wild style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I ""Trick Daddy"" emcees and I don't know, ""Nann Nigga""
Who can take it where I take it
You better go into God like Mase did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move em above clouds whether on some ?surface the earth? shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body

Like if a 12 gauge shotty shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas trying to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

Hey, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the motor watch stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for you eggin' for the best
Hurting like a sore in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Darken the line and your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond

Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucker nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept sayin the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, ""Off The Wall"" wit mines
I'm grabbin my balls when I rhyme, nine nines busting plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You aint on my mind I'm thinking 'bout paychecks
Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We getting money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday

The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I want to save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like",The 6th Sense,2000

Yo, yo

The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After, traveling the world to see paper's just paper

The simps, please
These studs mention me,
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
On the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killing 'em soft
Dealing with golf, getting blowed on the course
I be dissing magazines, but then buy the source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down, like bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is beat street in backpacks
Bragging how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land
I done thought of, a master plan, it goes

Common,"Ah keep on

Motherfucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
Miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack grooves
Rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollow and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to break dance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it,  C O double M O to the N""

My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say ""We gotta get over""
That juggy shit is over, the war is on
I only want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a fuck what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I ""X"" cats like a Muslim
He fell off cause I pushed him
Let his Bentley and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it,  C O double M O to the N""

You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thing
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of fagots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood""
Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood""
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section for taking
You got to reduce aggression

I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall

Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled,

Laying in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some geto heaven

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, I want the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rocking the holy spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more

Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cause one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stopping him for
Not even I could ignore being alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and god

I'm laying in some heaven, need a little company, yeah

As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys who collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hoping you could grow to it
Whether serving or a surgeon, you goin' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like donnie hath' helped me see lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to imhotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and god

Deep as a skinny girl's cunt, I surface with the purpose
To let y'all niggas know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas making moves
That bob and weave, and niggas with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
Freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggas on the net, selling my shit

I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care

Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light

Suggesting beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard trying to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'mma lead you
And whatever's right, I'mma feed you

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib, it wasn't involving him
Four in the morning, my phone ringing
I'm thinking, ""Who the fuck is this,"" on the other line screaming
Told em, ""Keep down,"" but they was breathing hard
It was my grandmother telling me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezing but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat getting bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while
Not gambling but every now and then they'd smile
Then blow! They had Mag's
And told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzing, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hanging off they ass
Got her some water, and begin to think
How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
Cause yo, it's the big payback

Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggas probably knew something plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playing Jigga
Discussing how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggas next to me, was talking bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nothing
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticing these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talking if they did it, it could be they team

This Hype came in, selling CD's, said the BD's
Was bragging bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinking bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run
It's the big payback

My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinking when shit went down, I was I was there
Fucking with fam' who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pouring liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me running in place, it's getting tricky
(like who?) like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's, I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck

Three-alarm fire and a possible homicide
The building is entitled ""The Ultimate Barbershop""
There are six unidentified bodies in the building
They are all presumed dead
I repeat they are all presumed dead
However there are no suspects
I repeat the subjects are at large

Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over

Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrestle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new,
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the underground railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree with The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I turn to the musical stylings of a Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Betty
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children",Pops Rap III...All My Children,2000

We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah, yo, check it

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryin' to hold on
To life. She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her, that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would of served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see 'em when they taking her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middle-sex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seat-less toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years in a hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.

From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba.

Alright wit you it ain't alright wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yup, stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw something down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down south
All the way to London to my nigga Common house

Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreaming when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doing this shit like dude in wild style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I ""Trick Daddy"" emcees and I don't know, ""Nann Nigga""
Who can take it where I take it
You better going to God like Mase did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body

Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas trying to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

Hey, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for, you aching for the best
Hurting like a sore in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond

Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucker nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, ""Off The Wall"" wit mines
I'm grabbing my balls when I rhyme, nine nines busting plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking 'bout paychecks
Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday

Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on

Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down

Many paid dues, but few knew the costs

Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness

Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel

ATM's, Ericsson's

Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason

Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve 
Trapped in a belly of hell

Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him

They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll split your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it

They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]

Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your solid
Don't understand the point that you at

Or how the hell you came to it?

They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

Ain't change a damned shame

Nobody knows the troubles seen

'What can become of kings and young kids?'

Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from

Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write

Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions

This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you

This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace are you

The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements,

I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]

I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve

Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me,
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising

From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us

They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control 
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul

Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is

You built for that? Is you cut for that?

Your life was like a hurricane, yo

I wonder how you gettin' by
And all the stars still in your eyes
But you still just get the five
You break the bank to spend the time
I reminisce of shifting time, to when you was mine

[Bilal]
Years ago, in a mist of hallways and sliding doors
Missing links of family very obscure
Vision of you shine
But only for a short time
My mistake I didn't pick up on it till years down the
Line

Here now as I (reminisce) reminisce, will I ever see
Your face again?
(In-fect-ion)
Baby as I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see your
Face again.

The divine has placed us
In a small world (yes)
And thankfully so (Thank God)
Our paths cross once more
And to whose surprise but mine
Was 14th and 6th was the placed where we combine once
More
There at the front door of the cornor store you stood.

As I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see our face
Again

Yes Sir
Yo I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

C'mon and embrace the chaos
We like to embrace the chaos, yeah

You are the world

You are the world

Am I a patriot of the chaos?
Everyday I watch young studs play blocks
In front of buildings, dealing what they gotta
Currency and game exchange
What else?

Souls bought and talked with the father of time
Ask if I'm embracing it, I either wasting it
My mind feel like I'm chasing it
Everyday it gets harder to author a plan
Consult with the Gods 'cause I know they smarter than man

It's hypnotic how the chaotic harbor the land
Through raw metals, slick women, cars and sedans
Guess we all part of the dance in one way or another
The way a man beat his woman, feeling that he love her

They way five children get killed by their mother
Parts of the universe still to discover
The real uncover fake whether love or hate
For revolution, chaos we embrace

You are the world
[Incomprehensible]
You are the world
[Incomprehensible]

It's like I wrote for freedom my God sticks in
You gon' have to tote for freedom, I awoke in the p.m
To let my folks know it's gonna
Be a brighter, there's light that shines on the corner
In the dawn of the chaos, I try not to be
A pawn or a player so nights I stay up

Write words, for me it's like a prayer
Knowing it'll be, I put it in the air
And stare at the emotions of those in the commotion
Hoping it's the chaos that we grow from
Opened a cold one, build with warriors that hold gun
For the same prize, our souls run

From they window, they see no sun
I say, ""Revolution, when he gon' come?""
Yes he came, in way that may seem strange
Only through chaos will we ever see strange

You are the word

You are the word

You are the word

Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch
In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it
I'ma give it, as far as you can take it
Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny
Many can find it but few can climb it
I'm open-minded like a pothead
Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed
In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls
Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle

He gave me poetry
And he was my first

But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
I can depend

Without you, baby
It feels like a simple true love

To the beat ya'll and ya don't stop

Or could it be that it was
All just so simple then

He's just a friend

He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and he knew
We couldn't rush but

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder

But that is all behind me

In many ways them boys made her better
To grow I had to let her (let her)
She needed cheddar and I understood that (that)

Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman

My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)

Common,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Telling it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love making
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watching Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the Creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you 
[Chorus]

He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you 

[Chorus]

Common,"It's just a fly love song, what

Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm going to do the best I can do
Cause I'm the best when I'm with you

Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard in you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me
May have to die with you

Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny to we connected girl
You and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight",Come Close,2002
Common,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere,2002

My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

[Chorus: Common (Omar)]
Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Just move, and shake, and grind and hustle
It's on your mind so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that)
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that

[Dart Chillz]
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collectors and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Every time you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks

Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sow clothes
Some hobo at the junction inbetween cars
Some enter in functions inbetween stars
Some teach, some preach saying they seen God
Some put they money up, against me odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin El Derado's bumpin' El DeBarge
Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, its the hustle

Common,"Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music

Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music
