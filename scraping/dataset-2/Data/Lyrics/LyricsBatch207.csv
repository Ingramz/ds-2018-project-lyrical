Ely Guerra,"Todos dicen que es mentira
que te quiero
porque nunca
me habian visto
enamorada
yo te juro que yo misma
no comprendo
el por que
de tu mirar
me ha facinado
cuando estoy cerca de ti
ya estoy contenta
yo quisiera que de nadie te acordaras
tengo celos
hasta del pensamiento
que pueda recordarte
a otra persona amada

jurame
que aunque pase mucho tiempo
pensaras en el momento
en que yo te conoci

mirame
pues no hay nada
mas profundo
ni mas grande en este mundo
que el cariño que te di

besame
con un beso enamorado
como nadie me ha besado
desde el dia en que naci

quiereme
quiereme hasta la locura
y asi sabras la amargura
que estoy sufriendo por ti

Todos dicen que es mentira
que te quiero",Jurame,2002
Ely Guerra,"Nuevos ojos, nueva piel, nuevas las manos del placer,
van metiéndose why a poco dominando mi querer, mi querer.

why la flor sobre la herida que ha dejado
la tristeza del vacío indeseado
es la flor que va creciendo en la marea de mi piel.
why al olvido de los días imagino tus caricias why te pido, juégate...

...la aventura que posiblemente sea una más
pero como siempre he sido muy intensa pienso que te quedarás

why en el éxtasis de un beso imaginario
mis tragedias forman parte del pasado
why me guardo la visión maravillosa en la piel
why en el éxtasis de un beso imagino más que eso
why te pido juégate.

why al olvido de los días
imagino tus caricias why te pido, quédate!
why en el éxtasis de un beso imaginario
mis tragedias forman parte del pasado
why me guardo la visón maravillosa en la piel

why en el éxtasis de un beso imagino más que eso
why te pido, quédate!",Peligro,2003
Ely Guerra,"You are that angel who took my heart
Now I'm bleeding, messing up all over my house
I am the girl that's holding a hole
Emptiness is crying it makes me feel alone

If I drink a whiskey with my girlfriends
My heart is not with me
If I cook a meal for all my best friends
My heart is not with me
If I sing a song for mom and daddy
My heart is not with me
If I'm by myself thinking about it
My heart is not with me

I'm in my bedroom, I'm in my car
I am at the movies, now I'm in a bar
So beautiful angel, what can I do?
Nothing really matters I rather be with you

If I drink a whiskey with my girlfriends
My heart is not with me
If I cook a meal for all my best friends
My heart is not with me
But if you decide to come around me
The wound may stop to bleed
And if you enjoy my smile, my angel
You should stay with me",Angelito Heart,2004
Ely Guerra,"Bésame, bésame, bésame
Bésame que soy para ti",Bésame,2004
Ely Guerra,"Suéltate detrás de ti hay un colchón
Que espera ansioso tu caída
Déjate confiado en los brazos del dolor
Que el tiempo cura heridas

Algo va volando sobre ti, yo no sé qué es
Pero va buscando que te montes en él
Deja que te eleve y deja que te lleve y
Vuelve a nacer, vuelve a nacer

Suéltate, el silencio abraza tu temor y
Cuida de tu alivio
Déjate liviano en las locuras del amor
Que enciende tu destino
Algo va volando sobre ti, yo no sé qué es
Pero va buscando que te montes en él
Deja que te lleve y deja que te eleve y
Vuelve a nacer, vuelve a nacer
Algo va volando sobre ti, yo no sé qué es
Pero va buscando que te montes en él
Deja que te lleve y deja que te eleve y
Vuelve a nacer, vuelve a nacer",El Colchón,2004
Ely Guerra,"Cuando las almas van enredadas no hay más
Que un mar de pasión
Van enlazadas, acaraciadas y no hay más
Que el olor de su amor

""Me gustas tú, Rigoberto, y tú y tú, pero
Por encima de todas tus otras cosas
Me gustan tus orejas voladoras""

Entre dos almas enamoradas sólo hay
Juegos de seducción

Ven juntito a mí que te quiero besar
Ven juntito a mí no te arrepentirás
Ven juntito a mí tu lenguita, he de acariciar
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás

Puedo ver que en amor el inicio tiene tanto placer

Ven juntito a mí que te quiero besar
Ven juntito a mí no te arrepentirás
Ven juntito a mí tu lenguita, he de acariciar
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás",Lucrecia y Rigoberto,2004
Ely Guerra,"Si te dicen que soy mas bonita que tu, no les creas
Si te dicen que yo soy una flor azul, no les creas
Si te cuentan que soy amorosa
Si te dicen que soy deleitosa, oh no, no les creas

Si te dicen que soy mas bonita que tu, no les creas
Si te llega el rumor de mi suave calor, no les creas
Él sabe, él sabe bien, no hay porque preocuparse más
Uu uu uu, déjalo pasar
Son tú y él sin más
No lo pienses más

Si te insisten que soy más bonita que tú, no les creas
Si te llega el rumor de mi suave pasión, no les creas
Si te cuentan que soy amorosa
Si te dicen que soy deleitosa
Si te cuentan que voy color rosa
Si te dicen, si te cuentan que yo, no les creas
No, no les creas, no les creas, no, no les creas
Uu uu uu, déjalo pasar
Son tú y él sin más
No, no, no lo pienses más
Uu uu uu",Mas Bonita,2004
Ely Guerra,"Te regalo mi sol
Mi luz
Mi playa

Te comparto mi dicha
Y mi pesar
Te doy las llaves
De mi casa y mi confianza

Te cocino y te llevo
A pasear

Te regalo la sal
De mis historias
Te comparto mi fuerza
Y mi debilidad

Te muestro el cielo
Al que también llamamos gloria
Te regalo mi voz
Mi libertad

Solamente hay algo
Que yo me quedaría
Es la imagen de un santo
Que me cuida
Noche y día

Te regalo mis fotos preferidas
Te comparto mi humana condición
Te llevo mas allá del limite y medida
Me convierto en tu amiga, la mejor

Te llevo mas allá del limite y medida

Ely Guerra,"Sentí de momento
su piel y su aliento
Me voló el sentido
No te miento

Lo vi alejarse
Pensé en olvidarle
Pero fue tan fuerte
Que no puedo

Uh huh

Tengo el corazón herido
Solo pienso en tus cariños
Ojos claros, labios rosas
Déjame que te haga cosas

Tu mirada me lo ha dicho
Soy deseo inadvertido
Ojos claros, labios rosas
Creo mi fuego te provoca

Soñé con su boca
Pensé en su boca
Morí por su boca
Créemelo

Uh huh dadadada

Tengo el corazón herido
Solo pienso en tus cariños
Ojos claros, labios rosas
Déjame que te haga cosas

Tu mirada me lo ha dicho
Soy deseo inadvertido
Ojos claros, labios rosas
Creo que en ti arde la cosa

Solo espero que con el tiempo

No te arrepientas","Ojos Claros, Labios Rosas",2004
Ely Guerra,"Son las diez de la mañana cuando abrí el ojo te vi
Me paré tan aterrada que no sentí

Que el amor llegaba a mi
Que no pude resistirme más
Que en el centro de mi ser había un lugar
Pa-ra-tí

En el cielo hay una estrella
No parece ser fugaz
Me dibuja la belleza
De aquel lugar en donde hay
Color, amor, hermoso amor
Me di cuenta

Que el amor llegaba a mi y
Que no puede resistirme más
Que en el centro de mi ser había un lugar pa-ra

Ely Guerra,"I'm standing right in front of the malecón in
Puerto Vallarta
Somebody told me you loved me, so
Come on, get in on, get it on

Happy loneliness I feel standing right here in
Puerto Vallarta
Warm blow below my orange dress, so
Come on, get it on, bring it on

Warm blow below my orange dress so
Come on, get it on, bring it on

The way I see things here it's very nice
It's very open, things are really, really clear
Are very soft, are very hard
Are very calm, are very safe
Are very fine, are very beautiful
I have to run to my hotel
And be ready for me, ready for you, ready for it
And be ready for me, ready for you, ready for it
Oh my babe

If I have to say a word I must confess
I love you back, honey
Lovely your love is so lovely, so
Come on, get it on, bring it on

The way I see things here it's very nice
It's very open, things are really, really clear
Are very soft, are very hard
Are very calm, are very safe
Are very fine, are very beautiful

Quiero cantar, ver el amanecer
Quiero sentir sólo tu dulce boca
Y bailar, quiero sentirme bien

Quiero bailar, quiero sentir el cielo

Mi sonrisa va a nacer
Yo no soy la de ayer, I love you
Sobresalta que en mi interior

Ya no soy la de ayer, I love you

Corazones pintaba yo

Ely Guerra,"Tienes labios de saber besar
Pero es que en ti es difícil no imaginar
Y a veces me quedo quieta en mi utopía
Te dejo, me dejo y sudo de alegría
Te dejo, me dejo y siento tu venida

En la solitaria y bella oscuridad
Voy quitándome el deseo por ti
Me consuela la serena inmensidad
De las cosas que yo puedo sentir
Y si acaso ves mi luz o mi señal no des vuelta

Tienes labios de saber besar y
De tu boca se me ocurren cosas más

En la solitaria y bella oscuridad
Voy quitándome el deseo por ti
Me consuela la serena inmensidad
De las cosas que yo puedo sentir
Y si acaso ves mi luz o mi señal no des vuelta

Te dejo, me dejo y creo

En la solitaria y bella oscuridad
Voy quitándome el deseo por ti
Me consuela la serena inmensidad
De las cosas que yo puedo sentir

No, no des vuelta
Te dejo, me dejo y creo en las mentiras",Tu Boca,2004
Ely Guerra,"Con una lagrima de fe sobre tu piel
Olvide la grieta que dejo tu amor
Pero ese instinto taurino de tu ser
Me obligo a azotarte tiernamente

Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin amor
No sufres mas

Toda esa noche provocaste ver en mi
Lo que a nadie muestro en la intimidad
Pero esa forma de mirada que hay en ti
Me obligo a matarte lentamente

Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin amor, tiernamente

Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin amor

Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin amor, tiernamente

Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin dolor no te haces feliz
Sin amor

No sufres mas",El  Duelo [Unplugged],2014

Elyar Fox,"This one's for the girls that like to lose their minds
They hit rewind and then they lose their minds
Hey, this one's for a girl that keeps me up all night
She's working overtime, my heart's working overtime

So hey girl, hey girl, why you hesitate, girl?
'Cause I gotta see pretty and it's right by me tonight, tonight
Wait girl, wait girl, why you complicate, girl?
I got money in my pocket and I kinda wanna blow it tonight, tonight

So if I lose my head tonight
Don't forget to tell the morning light
To wake, wake me up, up, up in time
And do it all over again, do it all over again

Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again,
Do it all over again.

Let's go to a place we've never been before
I wanna see it all so let's see it all
Can't stop, won't stop till we've seen the freaking world
It's just outside the door so what you waiting for?

Do it all over again.

Let's go, let's do it again
We've got time, let's sleep every other weekend
Let go, put your hands up higher
And higher and higher

Hold on if you feeling the love
Baby, take another second just to dial it up
Hit play, rewind, turn back in time
We start the night till the sunrise

To wake, wake me up, up, up in time

Elymar Santos,"Te amo, mas não quero
Nem te ouvir e nem te olhar
Por isso Deus me livre
Eu tenho medo de voltar

Me fez sofrer demais
Mas te olhando eu fico bobo

Elymar Santos,"Tudo era apenas uma brincadeira
E foi crescendo, crescendo, me absorvendo
E de repente eu me vi assim completamente seu

Vi a minha força amarrada no seu passo
Vi que sem você não há caminho, eu não me acho
Vi um grande amor gritar dentro de mim
Como eu sonhei um dia

Quando o meu mundo era mais mundo
E todo mundo admitia
Uma mudança muito estranha
Mais pureza, mais carinho mais calma, mais alegria
No meu jeito de me dar

Quando a canção se fez mais clara e mais sentida
Quando a poesia realmente fez folia em minha vida
Você veio me falar dessa paixão inesperada
Por outra pessoa

Mas não tem revolta não
Eu só quero que você se encontre
Saudade até que é bom
É melhor que caminhar vazio
A esperança é um dom
Que eu tenho em mim, eu tenho sim
Não tem desespero não
Você me ensinou milhões de coisas
Tenho um sonho em minhas mãos
Amanhã será um novo dia
Certamente eu vou ser mais feliz",Sonhos,2006
Elyse Davis,"Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

Your vows you've broken, like my heart,
Oh, why did you so enrapture me?
Now I remain in a world apart
But my heart remains in captivity.

Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,

It does the more enrapture me,
And even so, I still remain
A lover in captivity.

Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

My men were clothed all in green,
And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,

Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

Elyse O'Connor,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Elysia,"Underneath the harvest moon

And take away our sorrows
Play for me, minstrel, play
And we'll follow
Hear, listen, can you hear,
The haunting melody surrounding you,
Weaving a magic spell all around you

We should have seen it from far away,
Wearing such a thin disguise in the light of day

Arousing my planet

Round, round, and around
Surrounding my planet

My heart beats madly like a drum
Beaten chamber, almost numb
It's beating faster and faster
Slow down dear, slow down

Round, round, and around
Flying me forward
Thrusting me far
Round, round, and around
You caught me a star

You can make me if you try
Gently like a lullaby
You dig me deeper and deeper
Go down dear, go down

You are the ink, drawing me
You are the mouth, gnawing me
Yours in the voice, calling me
Star, star

You can make me if you try
Gently like a lullaby
Hold me tight inside your arms
Make me feel just like a star
Like a star

You can find me if you try
Slip into the needles eye
Fold me, hold me like a charm
Make me feel just like a star
Like a star, like a star
Like a star, like a star

Elysium,"In the middle of the night I am still alone
In silent journeys to hidden stars

And fly into an open sky
Where I shall find
All that is mine

You take me there
Where pain slowly leaves my body
Caress my hand
The dawn will never come
A lonely wolf I am
With your light I awake
You are my sister moon
Shinning so bright

In the middle of the night
I am still alive
In silent journeys to hidden worlds
I steal your light
And sail across the starlit heavens
Where I shall find
All that is mine

Where pain slowly leaves my body
Caress my hand
The dawn will never come
A lonely wolf I am
With your light I awake
You are my sister moon

Elyssa Samsel,"Happy, merry, holly, jolly season's greetings here
I'm wondering what your family does at that time of year
Love and joy and peace on Earth and tidings of good cheer
Do you have tradition things
For that time of year

Well, we hang up boughs of evergreen on every single doorway
Bake a giant cookie in the wavy shape of Norway
Go from door to door to door while singing with our choir

Hang up all your giant socks above an open fire
(That sounds safe)

So happy, merry yuletide carols, faithful friends are dear
Thanks for sharing what you do
At that time of year

We'd better get a move on if we're gonna hit every house in the kingdom

I'm here to ask you what you do
At that time of year
Hi, shalom, happy solstice, fancy chandelier
I'm looking for tradition stuff
For that time of year

Well, we make our decorations out of flotsam and jetsam
Bake a yummy fruitcake, and you can't leave till you get some

(That went right through me)

Buy each other presents and then hide them very nimbly

Wait up for a chubby man to shimmy down your chimney
(Breaking and entering, ok on Christmas)

Oh, happy, merry, muletide barrels, faithful glass of cheer
Thanks for sharing what you do
At that time of year
Thank you

We knit scarves and sweaters and we wear our matching mittens
Don't forget the jammies that I knitted for my kittens
Eight nights in a row we light menorahs on our mantels

You cut down a tree and then you dress its corpse with candles
I love it

Anna and Elsa will have all that they need
I'll fill my sleigh here with the help of my steed
It'll be the best time of year
It's up to you
Up to me
Up to (mew)

And festive tidings, midnight clearing

Elza Soares,"Se acaso você chegasse
No meu chateau e encontrasse
Aquela mulher que você gostou
Será que tinha coragem 
De trocar nossa amizade
Por ela que já lhe abandonou?

À beira de um regato
E de um bosque em flor
De dia me lava a roupa
De noite me beija a boca
E assim nós vamos vivendo de amor",Se Acaso Voce Chegasse,1997

Se não eu morro de ciúme

Ai, ai, ai, que coisa boa 
O beijinho do meu bem 
Dito assim parece à toa

Que gostinho divinal

Elza Soares,"Quando você for convidado pra subir ao adro 
Da fundação Casa de Jorge Amado
Pra ver do alto a fila de soldados quase todos pretos
Dando porrada na nuca de malandros pretos
De ladrões mulatos e outros quase brancos
Tratados como pretos
Só pra mostrar aos outro quase pretos
(e são quase todos pretos)
E aos quase brancos, pobres como pretos
Como é que pretos, pobres e mulatos
E quase brancos, quase pretos, de tão pobres, são tratados

E não importa se olhos do mundo inteiro
Possam estar por um momento voltados para o largo
Onde os escravos eram castigados
E hoje um batuque 
Com a pureza de meninos uniformizados de escola secundária
Em dia de parada
E a grandeza épica de um povo em formação
Nos atrai, nos deslumbra e estimula
Não importa nada: nem o traço do soldado
Nem a lente do Fantástico, nem o disco de Paul Simon
Ninguém, ninguém é cidadão
Se você for à festa do pelô
E se você não for

Pense no Haiti, reze pelo Haiti
O Haiti é aqui o Haiti não é aqui 

Na TV se você ver um deputado em pânico mal dissimulado
Diante de qualquer, mas qualquer mesmo, qualquer qualquer
Plano de educação que pareça fácil
Que pareça fácil e rápido
E vá representar uma ameaça de democratização do ensino
De primeiro grau
Se esse mesmo deputado defender a adoção de pena capital
E o venerável cardeal disser que vê tanto espírito no feto
E nenhum no marginal
E se, ao furar o sinal, o velho sinal vermelho habitual
Notar um homen mijando na esquina da rua
Sobre um saco brilhante de lixo do Leblon
E quando ouvir o silêncio sorridente de São Paulo
Diante da chacina

111 presos indefesos, mas presos são quase todos ou
Quase pretos
Ou quase brancos, quase pretos de tão pobres
E pobres são como podres e todos sabem como se tratam os pretos
E quando você for dar uma volta no Caribe
E quando for trepar sem camisinha
E apresentar sua participação inteligente no bloqueio a Cuba

I'm as real as it gets, with the steel and the clips
Buck and make niggas duck, and kneel and do splits

This should have been a double album commemorative disc

And a lot of rap niggas got lost
Heard Phontigga carrying tunes and assumed he don got soft
They didn't understand it was my next direction
So I'm playing postman and addressing questions

No I don't eat meat, but yes I'm still beefin

Ties will never sever

Did what you had to do and now you deceased

The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW

And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Eman,"Seduto al banco tracciavo I voli 
Le nuvole così distanti 
E il professore mi rimproverava 
La sua noia e i miei occhi stanchi 
Odorare sui fiori freschi 
Insieme a lei aspettavam fuori 
É strano come i piaceri possano apparire più grandi 
E poi giochi nel buio dove si illudono gli occhi 
Ho imparato che l'amore si consuma da se 
Le corse e gli amici ed i viaggi interrotti 
Quante cose da perdere 
Ho visto di spalle una parte di me 
Ho impiegato degli anni per perdermi 
Ho visto del falso anche dentro di te 
Ho ucciso dei sogni per crederti 
E ho lottato e vissuto e son stato più giù 
Ho inciso I pensieri più liberi 
Mi ritrovo il coraggio di chiedere padre e se non do il mio meglio, puoi uccidermi 

E poi le scuse per i vent'anni 
Gli studi inutili e i bei discorsi 
Le notte spese a trovar le parole 
Per intrattenere i rimorsi 
Le paure e i giorni passati 
Hanno entrambi gli artigli 
A ricordarci che i sogni dei padri non sempre son quelli dei figli 
E poi ti domandano ma quello che scrivi è frutto di immagine o fa parte di te 
Come spiegare che quello che provi si imprime sui fogli e si spiega da se 
Ho visto di spalle una parte di me 
Ho impiegato degli anni per perdermi 
Ho visto del falso anche dentro di te 
Ho ucciso dei sogni per crederti 
E ho lottato e vissuto e son stato più giù 
Ho inciso i pensieri più liberi 
Mi ritrovo il coraggio di chiedere padre e se non do il mio meglio puoi uccidermi (puoi uccidermi) 

E queste mani non stanno ferme 
E questi fogli sempre meno bianchi 
Mi sveglio ancora con le paure 
Che lasciano i segni sui fianchi 
Vorrei fermarmi e chiudere gli occhi 
Ma una voce ripete 
Ho letto troppi libri 
Ho preso troppi vizi 
Ho visto di spalle una parte di me 
Ho impiegato degli anni per perdermi 
Ho visto del falso anche dentro di te 
Ho ucciso dei sogni per crederti 
E ho lottato e vissuto e son stato più giù 
Ho inciso i pensieri più liberi 
Mi ritrovo il coraggio di chiedere padre e se non do il mio meglio puoi uccidermi",Amen,2016

Even through the mid-life crisis', y'all know who the nicest is
Always tell it like it is in spite of it
Dudes frontin' quite a bit, know I've grown tired of it

See I ain't fooled by what's spewed bout they income
Lose some you win some
Perception, shit'll give you grey hairs and then some
Inception are you living a dream of livin' in one
Haters see me get to thinking that it cant be all good
So I just kill them with the car, Brandy Norwood

Done carryin' dead weight, I'm no longer the paul bearer

At the only dude to do every drug and get lower
If niggas knew a third of all the weight that he shouldered
They'd know it an insult to think I'm only bipolar

How do I sustain it? Can't even explain it
I get more info from words that aren't spoken
More fixated on people or things when they are broken
I used to think everybody was pure
Now I'm busy trying to come up with everybody's cure
And that mindset led to close alarms
It be the people you help most, normally do the most harm
Baited my whole life, most times I ain't bite

Preconceived notions, nothing less than a failure
Base you's off of the cover and miss the best-seller
While I'm at it, let me tell you about this angel I met
She was fly, from every angle was fresh
And the way that she was jamming to the song called 'I'm Not Perfect'
Made me wanna know what her imperfections were
Now listen, and they weren't hard to find yall
Both parents were addicts like mine are
Mi-nor, but her story wasn't new to me
Most her life, shorty was homeless like I used to be
Could tell she never felt appreciated
Looked too much like her dad, was her mom's least favorite
Picture a bond supposed to be sacred
Looking up at your mom's eyes and seeing hatred
Pop left when she was young
Well she still young and he still gone, keep it 100
While I'm just amazed that a woman so beautiful
Could go through such ugliness and not become it
World keeps spinning, learned sinners keep sinning
And I can't even tell her some fights ain't fight worthy
Cause my pops got 20 years clean, but her pops got 20 years dirty
She moved to Jersey where he happens to reside
Thinking they'll be closer but it's only fiction
Cause she so young, all it does is cause friction
God picked the right nigga though, to teach about addiction
Years ago she should've been on homi' watch
So check the time out, just not on mommy watch
Cause someone beat her ass for years, someone calmly watched
Na, stepdaddy beat her ass, mommy watched
I keep her closer than ever she always next to me
Bisexual, comfortable sexually
I’m talking more comfortable than she should ever be
Especially considered the fact she was molested three
Times, some things a picture doesn’t tell
Can’t be worth a thousand words or her pictures might yell
Ya’ll see a pretty face on Instagram
I see a girl that should be scarred, never lent a hand
There go God’s work again, how’d he know I need that?
How the fuck did he pick her to walk me through a relapse?
Believe me, shorty I’ll kill for you if need be
And I need you much more than you would ever think you need me
What I do for you is tangible, shit that you can gain
You for me, not understandable, it's shit I can’t explain
Some folk don’t see the effect in that
Some say I’m using you, they’d be correct in that
But what for they’ll never know
It’s deeper than nude pics, it’s something I would never show

I figured like this
You came to me at a pool party and I was two steps away from smoking on that wet
My logic say to me, you came to me as a stranger and I hold you dearer than most people I ever met in my entire life, b
God’s work, not mine
You came younger and wiser, I'd have never known it
You don’t look your age
Younger and wiser when I was older and dumber
You came to me as nothing I'd have ever wanted
But everything I'd have ever needed, I swear to you its God's work, not mine

So you'll never be alone again
What's mine is yours, you won't be without a home again
And I know you from Miami, so you hate the cold
But you been through much colder than me and I'm much older
You just ride shotgun, let a nigga chauffeur
I'll cut the grass, you just look out for the cobras
We'll be just fine, God set these on our shoulders
I'll show you a man, you showed me I could stay sober
Let the world talk about every picture we post up
And we'll sleep well every night, cause they don't know us

I give you my all
But it seems like that's not enough
Letting you get more of me
So while the world keep on changing
The one thing remaining is
I keep letting you get more of me

God's work
Talk to em
Sometimes you gotta stick around for the miracle
Gotta wait for the miracle to happen
God's work, not mine

From where the pedal is served
Use hand, justice for words
Big up to LA, they was ahead of the curb
My hood we gang bang
You could get left on the curb
Yea I was raised here, but I'm tryna export
Police is crook yea, the strippers is escorts
Like my homey Layla, really I can't knock her
'Cause she getting paper, month ago she was knocked up
Baby daddy a dope boy, fresh homey was locked up
But he on the same shit, fucked around and got shot up
In my same mind, I'm like why he even bother?
At the same time don't know what he was a part of
And Layla over the casket, tears coming harder
The hood wins again, another son with no father

Say a prayer daily and end it with ""better or worse""
I lost faith, but grandma still keep her head up in church
Murder rate sky-high, employment is real low
Little kid try to rap, but will he get a deal? No
'Cause poverty kills slow, belief is beyond you
7 out of ever 10 bitches here got the monster
Like my little homie Tanya, I met her at Freaknik
Freak shit, the same bitch them niggas be all out in the street with
Open, in love with the service
But she got resentments you won't see from the surface
Feel like so many women look great, so she worship
Caught AIDS from rape, thought her whole life was worthless
Ho couldn't know how gorgeous her curves is

How did I get here? They act like the metal don't hurt
You just getting high, guess they trying to escape it
Or commit suicide assuming they couldn't take it
The streets is cold, still we run around naked
Success is a void and we replace it with hatred
That's your homie from way back, from so many years old
But friends turn green, even that acted weird old
You think he cared? No, y'all used to share clothes
Now you struggle for rent and he got ice in his earlobes
Your man won't even extend a hand, meeting all his career goals

I done some shit to some that I would never do to you

Some took advantage of you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you, must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit

Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me 'cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage it's a carry-on
So in life without her, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave,
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered them words I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shook that her passion's unparalleled,
I know she's ex's must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel, I love you

I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make it bittersweet, today that shit mad as none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, less started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you so it's ill how you believe in it
'Cause you done dated a few
If I'm a take a chance on love

I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
I'm holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay, a change of scenery
But mama said wherever I'mma go, I'm taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and it's been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup, she don't believe in me
It's not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating, in a crowd I feel alone, mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily, that was never mentioned to me
She told me there's a higher power and a lower power
And that I'll die if I don't find the strength to overpower
Then I replied, ""well aren't we all""?
She said ""yeah, but that should be on God's terms, not yours""

My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me
But He tells me I'm only human
And that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me
But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me I'm only human

Tryin' to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
It's been beside me all along, not the song
I wanna sit in silence, don't speak for a minute
Tired of being strong, please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs, worse
Can't be depression, couldn't have it this long
So many secrets I only told through a glass of Patron, my nigga
Speaking of secrets, that's when I got the Kaylintext
Read it and cried, couldn't believe what she was saying next
She said ""you're going through a lot
I'm hoping you ain't in the grave and dead
'Cause not too many people know your brain's a mess""
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all?
I wrote back ""lol"" but wasn't laughing at all
I ain't tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand, and I was writing a note
Didn't get far, as soon as I wrote down ""mom"" I just stopped
Couldn't lie to her, couldn't figure out how to say bye to her
Couldn't explain the ""why"" to her
Couldn't picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me, 'bout God's grace and mercy
He ain't even say goodbye, he said ""let us pray""
And then he went into a prayer, gripped the phone, closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt, this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck, will you just quack?
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck, way in the back

But I can't it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back, we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep, eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me, I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle, beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous, must've thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing, thought it was funny
Giselle's the homie, Alexa's twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldn't dick her at all
I'm guessing, maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months, yet you said this was a new me
In your head, guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous, B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy, this was 'bout respect
Y'all Instagramming pictures, trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didn't connect, but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now I'm fucking homeboy up, just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But he's a young nigga, that's no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago, you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news, I'm being falsely accused
And I don't understand, was this all part of a plan?
I guess I'll tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house?
Now they got a search warrant, just to come to my house
Question, were your feelings worth taking my tomorrow's, kid?
And you know Jersey gun laws, I'm talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine, this is a big waste of time
Let's get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what, cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me, but I'm the villain, over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check, you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
'Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts, but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine, there's a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime there's a pole in the bar centered
So even though it's from afar now
I still wish you the best, I know your heart's tender
I'm sorry all, I just got my own scars to tend to

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung

I had to leave for me to notice
That living in the sunshine's cold I'm dreaming of a place called home

I wanna run wanna run away

and I know there's no other above you,
I'm rolling with the punches, I won't lie down.

And I won't leave before an army makes me run,
Big fish eat the littles ones,
You and me we're sainted,
Don't let them break your soul.

Roll the dice, cause nothing's ever sure in life,
Even though the stakes are high, we're already sainted.
You're the first, I know it cause I'm fit to burst,
I know it cause my halo hurts, I feel like I've been sainted.

And I won't leave before an army makes me run,
Big fish eat the littles ones,
You and me we're sainted,
Don't let them break your soul.

Hot and cold so no one knows your mind

Now there's moments left til the world begins
Everything is possible it's beautiful

When will you wake up see what's happening
Right before your eyes no
And if you must blow hot cold take a swing
You will hit the target every time

So I look before I leap and I see
Wolves are at the door with my enemies
I was going to let them in but then you say
Watch the stars your feet are my enemy
It's too far for them to bring you to me
And everything is possible it's beautiful

I reach the water's edge
I wish that I could hold everybody's breath
Until no one has any left
You take me to the edge
You're the echo that I follow
The footprints that I left behind

Listen up I'll sing to you how I can
Out of luck now time is all that we have

Before you try to make that final push
Now your prayers will never be enough
It's nothing you cant change

Knowing that as fools go all away
Saying you should leave it all to fate

It's up to you on this new day
All the seeds youve sewn
You shouldn't throw away
Nothing would grow
You're in the shade

And sometimes I feel the force of the blow
And every day I take my toe and I dip it in the water
Every day it almost freezes me whole
It looks like I'm off the team, a survivor on the screen
Like I've got nothing left with nothing to show
And there's no reason to pretend your middle name's forgiving
I can see you've got a party to throw

(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home
(Oh oh oh) I'm gonna follow you home (Oh oh oh)

I won't quit while you're ahead, I won't pay for what I said
You're gonna have to take it out of my nose
'Cause every word just makes me choke, makes me sorry that I spoke
That's what I get for talking back I suppose
I've been queueing up for this, now my name's not on the list
And I missed who to call to get to the show
Well I don't mean to rush you on, I was stood here all along
And I've been waiting for a lifetime or so

You smashed the glass and set me free
But you don't want no more from me
Your final kiss jammed in the final piece
So I could see
I wrote you letters, sang you songs
But nothing works on you no more
I know it's much too late but I can't let go
Is there still hope?

The words that I wasted were bad adverts
All cut and pasted and nothing works
The songs that I sang you just made it worse
With melodies you don't follow

Je suis le secret de la rose rouge,
Rougeur que l'on a adulée des années,
Et dont l’odeur a été enterrée
En une journée.
Elle est sortie son voile en feu,
Pour appeler les hommes libres

Je suis une étoile dans l’obscurité,
Je suis une épine dans la gorge de l’oppresseur,
Je suis un vent par le feu attisé,
Je suis l’âme de ceux qui n’oublient pas,
Je suis la voix de ceux qui ne meurent pas.

Du fer, je forme de l'argile,
Avec laquelle je construis une nouvelle idylle
Qui devient des oiseaux,
Qui devient des maisons,
Qui devient vents et pluies.

Je suis les libres du monde uni,
De cartouches je suis.",Kelmti Horra (My Word is Free),2013

Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;

Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,
But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,
Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.

Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;

Emeli Sandé,"Te juro que es verte la cara 
Y mi alma se enciende 
Y sacas al sol las pestañas 
Y el mundo florece 
Dejas caer caminando un pañuelo 
Y mi mano sin mi lo recoge 
Tienes la risa más fresca 
De todas las fuentes 

Eres el timbre del nido de mis gorriones 
Hueles a hierba y me sabes a tinta y borrones 
Eres el rayo de mayo, mis letras, tus cremas 
Cantando en el coche 
Cuando juntamos las sillas me siento tan torpe 

Me tienes guardados abrazos que abarcan ciudades 
Tienes un beso de arroz y de leche en el valle 
Y dices que vienes de Marte y vas

A regresar, vamos que te irás 
Pero es que a veces, tan solo a veces 
Lo que está siendo es lo que parece 
A veces parece que te hayas marchado ya 

Mi hembra, mi dama valiente se peina 
La trenza como las sirenas 
Y rema en la arena, si quiere 

Ay mi hembra, tus labios de menta 
Te quedan mejor con los míos 
Si ruedan mejor tu sonrisa si muerde 
Ay mi hembra 

Te acuerdas de cuando empezaron los amaneceres 
Siento que la madrugada nos hizo más fuertes 
Y luego la charla tranquila entre gotas 
Las migas hicieron su parte 
Luego se juntan las sillas
Las voces se duermen 
Y siento las lágrimas 
Caen pero no tienen nombre 
Y creo que tu confusión 
Te la quito en un baile 
En eso consiste la libertad 
En no renunciar a entregarte más 
Tú a mí me gustas tal como eres 
Si a ti te pasa lo mismo y quieres 
Nos vamos pa'lante y llegamos hasta el final

I guess you'll be confessing soon that you're evading me right
Hating me, right, waiting me, right

My mind talks and talks, smoke, fire and brimstone
Telling me we had our fun but it's over in dim tones.

So potent till the goading get going and now it's growing
And you rolling and throttling, falling like roses,
Swollen and growing in the blast
The throne with dishonor to close up my past.

And you find you're not asleep
Silence only sticks around
'Til someone in the room decides to speak

And luck runs out and hearts go cold
We're only young until we're old
And summer leaves us wondering where it went
The friends you have can disappear
The whole world can change within a year
And money only lasts until it's spent

But you, you, you last a lifetime (you last a lifetime)
You last a lifetime

Truth will change and time will fly
The party lasts until the wine's gone
This time next week the radio
Will change it's mind and play a different song

We stay in touch 'til we forget
And beauty fades, the kiss will end
And fame will love and leave you just as fast
You'll have it all until it's gone
The books gets burnt, the statues fall
Sometimes feels like nothing will ever last

But you, you, you last a lifetime
You last a lifetime

And all the signs seem to say love is lost

I could try a bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go

Keep on thinking 'bout the fight
Rest my head against the wall

Can we go back to the start?

You keep on insisting you’re different
You say you found another solar system, but listen
Before you buy a house and sell your spaceship
There’s something you should know
Travelled in a rocket, I dropped it
Saved it from some other form of damage, abandoned
But I see you’re a hopeful kind of planet
But baby I just think there’s something you should know

I left my heart on Pluto, Pluto, Pluto
I left my heart on Pluto, Pluto, Pluto
I left my heart on Pluto, Pluto, Pluto
I left my heart on Pluto

Baby you’ve been patient, I’ll try to explain this
My heart’s been trapped for many times by Venus and Neptune
Hurt me bad but not as bad Jupiter, go figure
But baby please don’t wait for me to fall

I left my heart on Pluto, Pluto, Pluto
I left my heart on Pluto, Pluto, Pluto
I left my heart on Pluto, Pluto, Pluto

Most girls are happy with a Mars, been tripping through the stars
But they talking bout Pluto, I've gotta be the darg
You know it in your heart, I’m down to get the card
You've been looking in the mirror like it’s just a big mirage
You have devil’s faith and you've married doubt
I'mma just give you space to plan it out
When it’s all settled down we've both got replacements
I ain't gonna fool for that talk from Uranus
Nah, we both play the same game
But only you play the blame game
I never thought anything when I met ya
Till we done everything on the same day
I pray that you change
You’re over-stressed, I'mma take you away
You’re overdressed, man I pray that you change

Emeli Sandé,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our six star
The Hotel Cabana, a world full of drama
Interior designed by Dolce & Gabbana
Hotel Cabana, where you check out 'fore you check in to our beds
And I guess you’ll write their checks out without checking
Double rooms with hammocks in, masquerades and mannequins
Discounts for kids now and anyone who hasn’t sinned
Yea, but beware of the piranhas
And surveillance from the cameras while you’re wearing your Havanas in

Hotel Cabana, where the sleepless kids live
Dancing with fire, look what young money did
Confetti on their heads, stranger in my beds
Cabana
Hotel Cabana, where the curious go
Jump in the sauna, let the bad habits grow
Oh oh dancing on the edge
Hope it never ends in Cabana

Let me take you on a journey through these eternal corridors
Polished floors, no third, no seventh or eleventh floor
Founded and built up on a premise of a clever thought
Witness an experience of something unforgettable

There are snakes and ladders yeah

Emeli Sandé,"I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try.
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy, still I'm not gonna lie.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.

I know I'm far from perfect, nothin' like your entourage
I can't grant you any wishes, I won't promise you the stars.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.

'Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
That's when you feel my kind of love.

And when you're crying out.
When you fall and then can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.

You won't see me at the parties, I guess I'm just no fun.
I won't be turning up the radio singing, ""Baby You're The One.""
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.

I know sometimes I get angry, and I say what I don't mean.
I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.

'Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
That's when you feel my kind of love.

And when you're crying out.
When you've fallen and can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.

That's when you feel
That's when you feel
That's when you feel, my kind of love

Just when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
That's when you feel my kind of love.

And when you're crying out.
When you've fallen and can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.

Emeli Sandé,"Feel like a superhero, what type of dreams are these
I’m as high as a eagle, I’m taller than the trees
And I can’t turn back, I tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone
Even if I’m dancing on my own
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted

All I hear is music, I’m losing all control
I have no excuses, can’t say I wasn’t told
If the sky turns black, I’ll tell my heart relax
Late at night, in the dark, I close my eyes
And suddenly everything is gone

I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Reach up for the light
I’ll be lifted, lifted, lifted
Devil can’t catch me tonight
I’m not afraid, and I’m not alone

Feels like I finally finally found it
More than I, than I could have ever imagined
After all this waiting and this holding on
Suddenly everything was gone

Euphoria to torture
I left a note that had a rhyme, it go
Love is like a ferris wheel
Love is like a roller coaster
Love is at a standstill
Body after body after body
It's a landfill and I just caught a body
In the lobby and got my hands filled
I'm a serial lover
I set up all the dates
That rang up fate and got my friends killed
I barely knew my dad, sometimes I feel like my mother
I love that Purple Rain love
That have a fight, that scratch my face
That fuck outside and ride my motorcycle in the rain love
Love is like a garden, love is like a death sentence
Love is like a pardon, I'm free again and ready
Once outside these prison walls, to believe again is scary
Your garden is my sanctuary

Emeli Sandé,"There was a little girl
Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seemed
Her happiness she lost
A broken tight-knit bond
Abandoning her trust
And now daddy's not around

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on

When she turns sweet sixteen
Her boyfriend called her his queen
A stimulating kiss, that felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another caress
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on (keep on comin')
Oh, girl, you're the queen
If you just believe
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on (you still carry on)

She became a happy wife
Whose husband called her queen
And she believed her life
Was perfect as can be
And when a surprise divorce came down
She rebounded and achieved
The mirror now reveals
What she can finally see

Woman, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on
Oh, queen (woman, you're a queen)

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

But I write what I like and I like the boom bap.

At the harvest fair she'll be surely there, so I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right, for a smile from my nut-brown rose

Till a smiling bride by my own fireside, sits the star of the County Down

With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes

Feedin' pigeons on Beacon Hill 
I was takin' my dog Jack out for a run 
We had a little time to kill

That somehow caught her eye 
But the next thing I knew we were sittin' there talkin' 
Laughin' into the night 

And from that moment on 
She never left my side 
Those autumn nights were long 
She was the first love of my life

(Yes, I remember) 
November 
Oh yeah 

She was workin' her way through school 
Waitin' tables at the Hungry Eye 
I was playin' a club down on the waterfront 
Afterward she'd come by 

Around 3 AM we'd grab some takeout 
In the heart of Chinatown 
And we'd hang out and stay up all night long 
Just talkin' and messin' around 

I never would have dreamed 
We'd ever say goodbye 
She felt like the sun to me 
On those cold November nights

A drowning man in an ocean of pain
When you gave me your heart to hold onto

That you give me everyday

It's the wonder in your eyes
It's the magic in your touch

I wake each day and live
A life that's filled with simple miracles

And I take your love for granted
I should hold you close instead

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said, ?Boy, let me tell you what?

?I guess you didn't know it, boy
I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare
Well, I'll make a bet with you?

?Now you play pretty good fiddle, boy

I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you?

And it just might be a sin
But I'll take this bet, you're gonna regret

And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
And if you lose, the Devil gets your soul

And he said, ?I'll start this show?
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

When he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded somethin' like this, here we go

Wondering if a single soul on earth
Would care at all

Lookin' at me, lookin' down
I think he recognized
That look in my eyes
Standing with him there, I felt ashamed

That in this life you try to get all you can take
When all along I've been needing was to find one good reason
To give myself, really give myself away

Every smile that lights my face
Every teardrop, every trace
Every secret hidden place belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you

You know the me that I remember always thought
You had to keep it all inside
Get in trouble being tender so you never say surrender
But it took you to finally prove me wrong

Every smile that lights my face
Every teardrop, every trace
Every secret hidden place belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be

My right hand on a steering wheel
Two young lovers runnin' wild

We bought string and a brand new kite
We couldn't wait to watch it fly
But it flew too high, it flew too high

But here comes the wind, let your string unwind
Run as fast as you can in your mind
Back to a place that you never forgot
Before everything was lost

I don't remember when we ran out of rope
But when we did we lost all hope
We just stood there cryin'
That’s what we learned about flyin'

So I took your hand and you took mine
And we waltzed together in time
But looking back I guess I didn't know
That I was in love and you were letting go

It's funny how your mind plays tricks on you
Seemed like the higher and higher we flew
You took off and I was made of stone
I was made of stone

But here comes the wind, let your string unwind
Run as fast as you can in your mind
Back to a place that you never forgot
Before everything was lost

I don't remember when we ran out of rope
But when we did we lost all hope
We just stood there cryin'

But then the sheriff solved the case
Pushed a gun in Josie's face
And said look here

Sidney stared right back in his eye.
Sidney chose a switchblade
And Benny got a cold meat pie.

Much to the people's delight.

"Emerson, Lake & Palmer","I've tried to mend
The love that ended
Long ago although we still pretend
Our love is surely coming to an end
Don't waste the time you've got to love again

We tried to lie
But you and I
Know better than to let each other lie
The thought of lying to you makes me cry
Counting up the time that's passed us by

I've sent this letter hoping it will reach your hand
And if it does I hope that you will understand

That I must leave in a while
And though I smile
You know the smile is only there to hide
What I'm really feeling deep inside
Just a face where I can hang my pride

Goodbye
Goodbye

We'll talk of places that we went
And times that we have spent
Together penniless and free

You'll see the day another way
And they could put the sunshine
for a nighttime where you lay

But if you do I know that
you'll be happy in the end",Trilogy,1994
"Emerson, Lake & Palmer","She looked at me across the room
Emerging from a silk cocoon
Along beneath venetian chandeliers
Against the moon her body rocks
Her eyes were cunning like a fox
The wings of passion fly on all frontiers

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
No one is to smart
In affairs of the heart

Now upon the bridge she waits
Dreaming of our tangled fates
Her face was like a ghost with eyes of jade
I fell just like a falling star
A victim of this coup d'etat
I could not see behind this masquerade

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
Be careful where you start
In affairs of the heart

Sometimes I think I'll never learn
Were all those promises in vain
Do the wings of fire still remain

All is fair in love and war
The tender draw the shortest straw
Like autumn leaves they vanish in the air
Is this the time we say good-bye
I call her room there's no reply
Tonight we end this fleeting love affair

They made up his bed

On which he was laid

He went to fight wars
For his country and his king
Of his honor and his glory

His blood ran as he cried
No money could save him

And we are never leaving
This place is part of us
And all these scenes repeating
Are cold to the touch

My hands seem to deceive me
When I'm nervous or when I'm healthy
The scenery's all drawn.
They hang here from the walls dear
Painting pictures, bleeding colors
Blanket the windows
Sometimes it gets so hard to breathe
Your eyes see right through me
These fights with your arms left beside
One thing and one more says goodnight
You've got the map come get to me
These knuckles break before they bleed
Tear out these veins that own my heart
This skin that wears your lasting marks
I've built these walls come get to me, come get to me
Is this your lesson, a slight discretion
The lines that keep you, the lines that sweep you
Lock the doors from inside
Your face is so contagious, it wears announcements
It leaves me breathless, I won't forget this, I won't forget
Let the walls have their say
This time the walls will have their say

Out where the lightning splits the sea

He knew he had to.

Please don't leave.
There's still presents under the tree.

The fireplace is cold and dry,
The wind whistles through trees on this cold winters night.
As you tell me we've shared out last
There's just one thing that I have to ask.

Please don't leave,
There's still presents under the tree.

It's you, you, you I need.

Randy is showing how the piggies eat.
And I'm laughing through the tears,

You take someone for all they have

And death
Was only a word
But to a jealous heart that has made its plans
It was the soil that gave it birth
And the sun it’s light there on me
Shone through the clouds and upon my feet
To the ground that we chose as a door to leave

Die for one man
I was so in love, I was just so young and so in love
How could I say no to the hand that was built for me
I saw it so clear, like the first day you laughed or said my name
I couldn't say no, but we both know, we both know

We would have been changed like the days of our lives
(The illusion was ours, it was joy it was rapture)
Oh this place is a hell with its death and goodbyes

And you can't stop yourself when you’re dreaming of days

In this world that’s to come, it's only the fear

Emery,"I thought I was the sun and all its light
Shining in the dark, your vengeance my guide
I wanted to take this world back for you
Tearing skin and voice let the light breakthrough

I can’t see a thing
I want this more than anything

The headlight stopped my feet from moving and 
My eyelids could not close or move away
From the echo of the voice that buckled both 
My knees and flung me to the ground beneath the weight
The earth and road seemed like they were not 
There at all but there it was and everything in place
But I was changed, I was not the same

But now I confess, here in my own flesh is the familiar and the intimate

7 words, 7 words have severed into me
7 words, 7 words have brought me to my knees

Count your blessings that you’ve never seen 
The things the simple things were ours to take
But the questions danced around our innocence 
And now the innocence is nothing more than faith
Gather towards the door your things
Come quickly now, the morning gives the light away
Open your heart, to the very worst parts and let them depart

I cut my teeth on the flesh of the liars
I made my words into stones and then broke all the bones
I never saw the blade that ripped up my rib cage
My eyes glazed over and the world moved on

What you felt, were lies they’d sell and nothing else

So I sit here making my big plans
Like they could rescue me but now I see
The answer through my window
That nothing can replace
Those memories my father gave me
Are all that’s left but I’m ready
To escape this life

I’m sorry that your efforts were in vain
You were promised so much more than I have gave
I’m not a honest man I was born for the grave

Emery,"You ever catch yourself just thinking of a way to get out?
It’s like a reflex motion
The words slip in and leave a taste that you 
Let linger for days, inside your heart

We fell asleep, just like before, there under trees
I can’t do this anymore

Make this all something that’s behind us
For me, for you, this is not the end but i’m scared

Color your words in a soft subtle sequence
But you force this on us like we shouldn’t care
The fields that they will find us in are marked and now
The end, the end, the end is here

We fell asleep, just like before
You said I can’t do this anymore

You better run, you best not stay
They catch you here this all goes away
This all goes away

Just give me a chance to change your mind
Speak with the others you will see
The place that you now hope to find
Your peace will cut pieces right out from me

You could make this all go away

Years swept by us like seas
And we slept by ourselves to see
We hid hope in our sleeves
And all the world knew we believed

This life took me by the hand
God knows where you’ll find yourself in the end

You better run, you best not stay

Emery,"This town ain’t big enough for both of us
So don’t sleep on the things that my hands have done
The flora and the fire keep lighting up the distance
Careful with your mouth don’t let it run

Out of sight, out of mind
Dug my heels into the earth
It was safe, it was mine, but this is where the way turns

Take it while you get it, toss this and forget it
As you swallow your seat and son
You’re plagued with pride of fathers
Long since dead behind you
Careful with your feet don’t let them run
To question yourself the cursed will stay away

You can camouflage, you can lock up and you can stow away
But it is to question one’s self in a hideout to leave the cover
The cursed will stay away
And in my hard heart I tried to block out
And to blot out, and obstruct the clouds
But the shroud, the bell, the blanket and the envelope will eclipse them now

Forget what you left, this part is never easy

Standing where the water meets the shore you feel the sun
Touch your face and leave its mark with nowhere left to run
To hide your shaking hands and words that swore this was the day
You never feel as weak as when the answers go away

I was caught in the current, it’s a lesson and i’ve learned it
The teacher left scars on our fists
I’m the worst, i’m the worst, just please leave me here
There’s pain we never speak of, second guess the ones that we love
And the last thing you want is for your last words to sound so scared
But you find yourself here, alone and scared
Will they leave you here, will you leave me here

The best part of that
Is I want it back
The best things to say
I want to say
That all this time I was wrong
The water’s deep
As they find their sleep
And I begged for less
But I second guessed
That you would come
After me

(from the hands of my mother to the hands of a girl
From the hands of my mother to the hands of the world
From the hands of my mother to the hands I see before me
Could I part this deep
I never wanted to say but I had to
And i’ll take your blame but it was always you
We left after morning as you called to your name)

The past still waits
It’s the pain we never speak of
To catch my eye
Second guess the ones that we love
And I never stopped
All the words and our confessions
To question
I never thought that I should question
To question why",Pink Slip,2015
Emery,"You pushed my head under the water
I lost my breath, but the skyline called my name

The wilds the wilds the wilds they pull you in
These miles we’ve walked and miles we talked have been
The first time I am not alone in my head
By itself, oneself, can’t find where it began

The dust you’ll find beneath my feet
Reminds me of the simpler things
When it was only you and me
But now I see, now I see

So we all fall asleep
So we laugh and play
So we drink and eat

So we count our time
So we know our keep
But it floats away,
Nothing seems to stay these days
Fragile and weak
It’s been years and now
I get a moment to speak

And all I think about
Is what to say
When you’re face to face with nothing
And nothing will escape your lips

The clouds, the clouds, the clouds
They take their shape
We dream that in their billows
Are answers to this place
You ask me to surrender
You’re sure it’s what I’ll take
We broke our bread together
And cursed it at the gates

I’m a son of a father
My mother’s oldest one
You make your trade with your brothers
Sister you’re not the only one

Head to toe I’m drowning
I told you not to speak
Frail and fragile weak dim
The light down on the street.

But the light still lingers

Leave me at the place where, the
work is done

I don’t want to sound like a broken record
but please bear with me, this is more than I can take

but somewhere in the end they’ve left my side

Did pretense make you weak your legs can’t even stand 
the promise of the dead is that they won’t be back again
Darkness Darkness found me, here like a common thief
You guard the exits captain, but choices are never free
Take my hands lead me on
I don’t want to give you answers
That you’d throw right back in to my face
I’m exhausted from being myself
But your voice, is the voice here and always

Inside, inside follow
Control that you swallow
You’ve got the numbers on your side
To bury me

It’s just as you said, in those words, I am identified

Let’s get this started right now
The endless excuses
We’re all to watch me try
Now to die

Did pretense make you weak your legs can’t even stand

Blood and bone have been my home, but in the eyes I see
Why it took me",Salvatore Wryhta,2015
Emery,"And I wanted to see it, the crease and the curve of the skin
Four words got me in again and again again
But my friend, it was the light just behind us, I knew we never could keep up
The beds we make, the steps we take, are graves we fill everyday

Roof top views of city buildings gathered
Where the sun sets on them steals the eye
Touch the streets with feet in hurried measure
Our discretion means we never lie

We never have to lie

You stole my eyes, so you I will take
You are the test of our grace
Threads become lines, we cross till they break
And they break from the seams to the bodies of men

The illusion was ours, it was joy and it was rapture
I would have settled for capture, but a lost life found my bed
And all the wages of another and the secret is no longer mine
Warm the body like so many others
Your discretion means we never lie

We never have to lie

You stole my eyes, so you I will take
You are the test of our grace
Threads become lines, we cross till they break
and They break from the seams to the bodies of men

Withered and Crushed the fire and the fate
You will die for our sake
We will see the world in the blood)

Time says we are meant to suffer slink back to the retch
I called him home
I never wanted them to wither or be crushed by the weight
The choice was all his own
How could I have known
The simple answers that hold people to the fire and their fate

Wait and see for yourself it's in the blood
it’s in the blood, the whole world is in the blood

I'd rather tell you how I ruled the world and never stopped
But this heart mine is shaking like a spinning top
And as it slows all my sins have caught the last of me

That reflection in the water tells a story true
But it's the last thing you want staring back at you
And wrinkled hands weak from plunder barely stir this away

There were years where our faces stayed in front us
There were moments we forgot what this really was
But the death of a memory, is the death we carry

We're desperate and dead set, we carry reasons in our chests
We reset and forget, the songs we sing are for the blessed

Emery,"Align yourself
With the freed men
How can you deny this ground
You sold your flesh

Tell yourself that you’re a free man
Tear your vestments the slave becomes the crown

The thirst filled us the worst years of
Birth and death were held by threads

The turning set about the pages saw escape
The filth of years beneath our fingers washed away
Then gold within our ears drew figures and erased
The wretched lost their way, they’re standing here today

Resist with wounded eyes, wide awake but dead inside

You’re breaking my heart, You’re breaking my heart
Standing here the audience will tear me all apart
The hardened answers you planned fell apart
So blanket me, so you can see, you’ve broken my heart

So I will tell you one last thing, intertwine us for history
It will seal our fates, but I take my place

Your rigid throats proclaim the righteous written word
But you cut out the veins and now you sleep with her
It’s dripping from your mouths, It’s pouring from your skin
The lust of power takes you and the stench has settled in
You have ground your teeth craving control

I see what’s waiting for me, and it’s beautiful so beautiful
I can’t stop these words they all just rush to me
But I guess I’ve lost my senses there’s just so much to see

But here I am and everything I’ve heard is true
And it’s you, so beautiful

The sky is falling in stones of water, the river’s now in sight
I have thought this all my life, but wondered if you’d try
I was half asleep when my bride’s words awakened me

We were always sure that the pages would be written
Not from our hands but the words you left inside of us
We were filling pools with ourselves and ambition
And here we are drowning out from our lives

To the deep, to the deep

The square of forty and I sit here listening in my head
The voice of angels or am I crazy, these places that were said
Would build a family but nothing from her could ever grow my name
Oh what lies we will believe but I’ll find my own promises to keep

I set my feet on the ground I put my back to this place

I sank my teeth in the kingdom come and spit out my years and held back my tongue

Things she remembered from the past
Everything she wants
She gets everything she needs
She smiles, she sighs, and she bleeds

I saw her on a railway station
As I pass a faded destination
I saw her smiling in a crowd
When we played some far off distant land

And she thought you were taking risks
The chances you took would never last
Everything she wants
She gets everything she needs
She smiles, she sighs, and she bleeds

I saw her in an alleyway

She comes at night when I pray
And brings a moment of elation

So what, I take what should be mine
I've searched the sea of empty eyes
And severed all my familiy ties
A mercenary feeds my soul
A plastic world, no getting old
A monkey wears the age-old crown
The other monkeys getting down

She comes
He comes
We come
She comes
Welcome

Walk through fear
Leave you, dear
Never wanted to create a tear
Walk through fear
If you dare

Emigrate,"My sickness slips inside you
Drowning in my poison
Desperately I hide too from heaven
Now we'll be together
I can make you better
Siphon your pain in me, so I bleed

Feed your dreams to fishes
Lie about your wishes
Eat away at your time, seconds are mine
Sometimes it seems we're toxic
Wake me up and shock it
My low self-esteem
Can make me scream

In my tears
Don't let me drown
My fears don't make a sound
My tears
Don't break me down
In my tears
Don't let me drown

It's only my psychosis
Feeling thorns of roses
Fill the void inside me
So you see
Feed me tranquilizers
Calm the storm inside us
It's so perverse to say
That I'm blind

Don't make a sound

Don't break me down

Let me break you down
For your sake
I will break you down

I would try for you
Try to walk you through
I would fight for you

Mesmerize my nights

Whatever's clever will have to wait

The city's got it all
Culture clash and sidewalk trash
Don't look down you might fall

And now we just feel like energy
New York city will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York city it's the place to be

I'm gonna win
I'm gonna lose
I'm gonna chase it till the end
And if you're walking in my shoes
You're gonna make it or pretend

I'd run when she called, summer, winter or fall, I couldn't help myself

It's been a long time, but she's still on my mind, the way she moves should be a crime

Watch her get down (sweet lord) watch her get down (oh no)
And she don't stop, she rock until your eyes are sore,

Watch her get down (sweet lord) watch her get down (oh no )
Maybe you got the shot, but you ain't ever gonna score

She's got the skills, dirty dreams are fulfilled, when she walks in the room
When will you learn, if you play you'll get burned, like a heatwave in June

Outside in the rain, broken hearts cry her name, until the early morn'
She's heaven on earth, like perfection gave birth, let the word be born

Drop that liquid on yo' tongue, put that reefer in your lungs
Close the curtains here we come, boy hush until I'm done

Puttin' it down for the B.C., in the backwoods where we be
Better call a producer when you see me
And get your ass right back in the GT
Y'all lame boys, hangin up lookin' just for a name boy
Goin upsize with the Game Boy
Witcho' mind right go out lookin' for a cane boy, it's a shame boy
You the main one tryna stall right, sold the broads out the game boy
I beat 'em down like chop chop chop
Yessuh, cut 'em up and leave 'em alone
On my cell phone they callin', talkin' 'bout ""Kosha baby, call me""
Leave your name and your number at the sound of the beep
And I'll get back witcha shawty
Most hated by baby daddies for breakin' up happy homes
When the men is on and she don't say no then that mean she wanna bone
So partna don't get me wrong, I'm just bein Kosha
That Southern playa with a stroke that keep 'em wet like a ocean
Yessuh, me and Bubba get rowdy (rowdy)
And me and Bubba get bout it (bout it)
We are violators we annihilate you, no ifs ands buts about it
The air up here stay cloudy, I originate in shotcallin'
We stay up in the club y'all look at us
And say, ""Damn, them boys be ballin""

You the ones be payin' hoes and buyin' them gifts (trick ass)
You mad when you find out some other niggaz get it
Ain't payin' no bills just stayin' real and still be hittin' it
I'm a old school playa I just pay for her dinner
Maybe buy a little liquor I spend some talk in the mirror
This the playa from the soul; love to gang up on hoes
I'm tryna let this pimp shit go cause I don't even like it no mo'
See these niggaz that I hang with they just run through these skanks
Talk about 'em over dinner, pass women like dank

Mmm-hmm, and I'ma put twenty-five
On the them ol' fire ass Mercedes Rolls
That don't never come 'round no mo' that shit right dere
Country-ass Bubba Sparxxx, ain't no fuckin around wit G.O. again
That put me in this backwoods committee
My ace Kosha, Bo Hagin, west central Georgia's finest
Man Bo, go on snap again

Man, I'm gon' tell it like it is, I'm gon' sit the rear
I stand true to high live, this a quest for a mil'
It done took a nigga different places, seen plenty of faces
Whatever may have been the cases I thank God for his graces
See my knife'll tell the fakers, kept me spinnin' like breakers
And every day I play awake a nigga learnin' by haters
See I take a ho, and shake a ho, that's how we live
All women ain't bitches but see most of them is, uhh

Emil Mangelsdorff,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

So early, early.

I can’t help but love thinking that everyone doesn’t get it
To my left there’s a window
Where did I go?
My reflection just planted two rows of coal
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless, and so

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die


I happened to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can’t help but back up when I think of what happens inside
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
What you're callin' a sin isn’t up to them
After all, (after all) I thought we were all your children,
But I will die for my own sins thanks a lot
We’ll rise up ourselves thanks for nothing at all,
So up off the ground up our forefathers are nothing but dust now

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
I am over twenty-five and I can’t make a name for myself some nights I break down and cry
I’m lucky that my father’s still alive he’s been fighting all his life
And if this is all I’ve ever known then may his soul live on forever in my song

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh

Emile Haynie,"Last Halloween when the devil grinned
The tattoos on your face covered up your skin

To throw around your body for a little fun
Put another photo, spend my cash
Put another photo, have a blast

It heals, since you kneel
And at baggage claim bawling til the morning darling

You slip away into the morning sun
When he touches your face and your day's begun
I know you hate yourself for what, what you've done
So you push it away, it's getting harder to run

When you run so fast and you run so long
And it's all your fault cause you were never strong
It's not much of a life though darling
It's not much of a life (life)

We started talkin'
As if nobody else exist

And her lucky 13 on her wrist

Beyond that lonely little life that she fears

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1992

And in a world apart

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Emile Pandolfi,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call

There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

Out of town were the people I knew

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made

Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

I hear it still, I always will

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

That you spend it all with me

Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

맺힌 내 땀을 봐라

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다

Taking this walk tomorrow
'Cause it's you that I like

And I'm hoping that maybe
Do you wanna be my baby
And if you do want me so much
You gotta have that special touch

Rubbing cress on my skin, God it smells so nice

Has given you the call

And call Alice when she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you have just have some kind of mushroom
And your mind is movin' low

Go ask Alice, I think she'll know

Have fallen sloppy dead

She sees a horse and rider pass
She says, ""This man's gonna be my death
'Cause he's all I ever wanted in my life
And I know he doesn't know my name
And that all the girls are all the same to him
But still I've got to get out of this place
'Cause I don't think I can face another night
Where I'm half sick of shadows
And I can't see the sky
Everyone else can watch as the tide comes in
So why can't I

Chorus

But there's willow trees
And little breezes, waves, and walls, and flowers
And there's moonlight every single night
As I'm locked in these towers
So I'll meet my death
But with my last breath I'll sing to him I love
And he'll see my face in another place,""
And with that the glass above

Her cracked into a million bits
And she cried out, ""So the story fits
But then I could have guessed it all along
'Cause now some drama queen is gonna write a song for me,""
She went down to her little boat
And she broke the chains and began to float away
And as the blood froze in her veins she said,
""Well then that explains a thing or two
'Cause I know I'm the cursed one
I know I'm meant to die
Everyone else can watch as their dreams untie
So why can't I

Emilie Autumn,"""Days of old,"" I tell my restless mind
Searching mountains, fields, and meadows green
What is it my heart can hope to find
All I long for I have never seen
Tales of glory written in the dust
Tapestries of deepest purple gold
Legends carved in stone tell me I must
Journey through the mist and bitter cold
Seeking in the corners of the earth
My companions I have never known
Blindly running forth, is honor worth
Endless hours of silence spent alone?

But in this brotherhood I still believe
And for the ones we've lost my soul will grieve
Yet through the world alone I wander for I know somewhere
I will find my brothers, by the sword I swear

In my memory awakening
Like a dream too sweet to cast away
Shadows of the past begin to sing
Calling out to me in their gallant way
Come away with us brother in arms
Through the seas of silver, fields of gold
Join us as we battle those who harm
And fight with valour as in days of old

But in this brotherhood I still believe
And for the ones we've lost my soul will grieve
Yet through the world alone I wander for I know somewhere
I will find my brothers, by the sword I swear

And for the ones we've lost my soul will grieve
Yet through the world alone I wander for I know somewhere
I will find my brothers, by the sword I swear

Rescue damsels fine and maidens fair
Free the noble who have done no wrong
Though it seems the world may little care
Some are left that to the Round belong

But in this brotherhood we still believe
And for the ones we've lost our souls will grieve
Yet through the world alone we wander for we know somewhere
We will find our brothers, by the sword we swear

I will find my brothers
I will find my sisters

Through the sea of painful
You have watched as I pull
Myself from the floor
And you were there when I
Built my tower like pebbles in the rain
Trying to balance all that I had left
With what I didn't have anymore

But would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose
Would you tear my castle down
Stone by stone
And let the wind run through my windows
'Til there is nothing left but a battered rose

You seem so devoted
Your love is unconditional
You were self-promoted

You were my everything

Where are you when I am screaming to my God
What am I coming to

If I had another place to go
Would you break me, is it that you know
I have no choice but to rebuild again
I'm tied so hard I can't remember when
I last walked free upon these feet of mine
But I'll draw the line
There will come a Time
When I am stronger

But you take your love
From under my feet
The very moment I arrive
I hold the invitation in my hand
You smile and I don't understand
When you tell me the writing ain't yours
You were the one thing I could count on
Even if your apathy was what I expected
Oh darling I waited and waited to feel your footsteps
And to hear your breath
But maybe I just wanted someone to wait for

[Chorus]
You were ever in my mind
You were behind my soul each time
I held it to the flame
You were ever in my precious thoughts
I'd leave a room of angels
Just to be alone
If only to say your name
I never told you I needed you darling
Like a rose needs the rain
How could you possibly know how much
So I reach for your love
Like the moon and the stars
Ever in my sight
Ever out of touch

There's a spotlight of a holy kind
Think it comes from somewhere
Up in the sky or from some far off lovely place
But this light never ever ever shone on me
At least as far as I could see
So I sat in the dark and I watched you
Now I just cry to myself
When there's no one around
And I teach myself to walk backwards
Out of any given situation
Yes I can be graceful and try
Not to step on my train and
You don't have to say goodbye
But I'll be right here if you want to

[Chorus]

Now I could paint your portrait
If I never saw you again
When I am old someone may ask me
If I ever loved
And I will speak but they won't recognize
My words, they'll say I'm telling lies
And maybe I am
Maybe I am
All I know is

Emilie Autumn,"I heard a story
It's too hard to mention
I heard a thing once
I can't even say
I had a moment
Of doubtful suspension
But it's almost forgotten
It's been pulled away

By too many hands
Touching where I stand
And I can't fall
Because you'll try and catch me
Never let me go
You don't think I know
I've heard it all
And so you'll never scratch my skin

I heard a boy say
It's all my invention
A fictional statement
It's all in my head
All I can tell you
My only pretension
Was in thinking you listened
To me when I said

By too many hands
Touching where I stand
And I can't fall
Because you'll try and catch me
Never let me go
You don't think I know
I've heard it all
And so you'll never scratch my skin

I've heard your paltering and your lies
And it won't go away when I close my eyes
Do you think of me when I'm no where near
When you shut your mouth tell me what you hear
I've heard it all
I've heard it all
I've heard it

Somebody called me
A paranoid angel
From on the other
Side of the wall
You might be special
But it's too late to change now
'Cause it isn't the first time
I've heard it all
For too many years
To relieve my fears
So I'm advising you
To get away and fast
If it's my mistake
Then the blame I'll take

And you won't be the last

In only six years
If it was an accident
Where are the tears
I am still unidentified
Behind the Cathedral
Is where my body hides
But I'm not inside
Just one of six-teen
In early one day
If it was a game then
Why couldn't I play
I am the abandoner
But still I remain

As my frozen pulse quickness
As the black plot thickens

like the story I heard
A lifetime ago
Where a girl
And this is funny
Took her life
And what she doesn't know
Is how long it takes
For the water to rise
And the breath to stop fighting
And the cold to close her eyes

Morality plays
On stages of sin
The easy way out
Or the easy way in
I am still overglorified
My reasons to live
Were my reasons to die
But at least they were mine
Now I'm freedom unbound
Cut the laces of life
The pistol
The poison
The noose
Or the knife
I have chosen my instrument
And said no goodbyes

As the black plot thickens

The art of suicide, gritty and clean
Conveys a theatrical scene
Alas, 'I've gone' she cried
Veins displayed
Melodramatically laid

Under the arches of moonlight and sky
Suddenly easy to contemplate why, why
Why live a life
That's painted with pity and sadness and strife
Why dream a dream
That's tainted with trouble and less than it seems
Why bother bothering
Just for a poem or another sad song to sing
Why live a lie

Because there's a story that ought to be heard

Emilie Autumn,"How old are you?
I'm older than you'll ever be
I've been dead a thousand years
And lived only two or three
I don't mind telling you
My life was ended by your hand
The kind of murder where nobody dies
But I don't suppose you'd understand

If I am Lolita
Then you are a criminal
And you should be killed
By an army of little girls
The law won't arrest you
The world won't detest you
You never did anything
Any man wouldn't do

I'm Gothic Lolita
And you are a criminal
I'm not even legal
I'm just a dead little girl
But ruffles and laces
And candy sweet faces
Directed your furtive hand
I perfectly understand
So it's my fault?
No, Gothic Lolita

Thank you, kind sirs
You've made me what I am today
A bundle of broken nerves
A mouthful of words
I'm still afraid to say
I don't mind telling you
Now that I'm old enough to love
I couldn't begin to even if
My pretty life depended on it
And funny thing, it does

If I am Lolita
Then you are a criminal
And you should be killed

I am your cream
I am your anti-American dream

I am your worst nightmare

You build yourself indulgent hell

Marry me instead of that strapping young goatherd, but when
I was in his bed, and my father had sold me
I knew I hadn't any choice, hushed my voice, did what any girl would do and
When I'm beheaded at least I was wedded
And when I am buried at least I was married
I'll hide my behavior with wine as my savior

But, oh, what beautiful things I'll wear
What beautiful dresses and hair
I'm lucky to share his bed
Especially since I'll soon be dead

Marry me, he said, god, he's ugly, but fortune is ours
Running in the gardens enjoying men, women, and flowers
Then I break a glass and I slit my own innermost thigh
So that I can pretend that I'm menstru...well, unavailable
My life is arranged but this union's deranged
So I'll fuck who I choose for I've nothing to lose
And when master's displeased I'll be down on my knees again

Oh, what beautiful things I'll wear
What beautiful dresses and hair
I'm lucky to share his bed
Especially since I'll soon be dead

When dining on peacock I know I won't swallow
Through balls, births, and bridge games I know what will follow
We're coupled together through hell, hurt, and hunger
Or at least until husband finds someone younger
Yes, fertilization is part of my station
I laugh as he drabs me in anticipation
Of sons who will run things when I'm under covers
But whose children are they? Why, mine and my lover's!

She knows lovers waking up in their beds

I want to heal you pretty sweet
I'll throw rose petals at your feet
I'll spend eternity
Comparing all my poetry to yours
I want to see love through your eyes
You'll never have to compromise
I'd give up all my fame
To fight your demons and your bloody wars

I want to mix our blood
And put it in the ground
So you can never leave
I want to earn your trust
Your faith, your heart
You'll never be deceived

Emilie Autumn,"Mad girl
Can you believe
What they've done to you?
Wouldn't they stop
When you asked them to leave you alone
In all your faerie tales
How did the prince say he loved you?
How did your father die?
Was he a good man?
Maybe someday you'll know

The beginning and the end
Much closer than they seem
Death is but a dream, I know
Dolls are meant to grow away
All broken and bent from petty play
My friend in this world
Is a bottle of nothing
Still I fly
Still I fall

Mad girl
Can you believe
What they've done to you?
Wouldn't they stop
When you asked them to leave you alone
In all your faerie tales
How did the prince say he loved you?
How did your father die?
Was he a good man?
Maybe someday you'll know

Like the water in the well
My melancholy state
Folly, fear and hate, I know
Even time will never tell
She teetered, she tripped
And then she fell
My faith in this world
Is a bottle of nothing
Still I fly
Still I fall

Mad girl
Can you believe
What they've done to you?
Wouldn't they stop
When you asked them to leave you alone
In all your faerie tales
How did the prince say he loved you?
How did your father die?
Was he a good man?
Maybe someday",Mad Girl,2007
