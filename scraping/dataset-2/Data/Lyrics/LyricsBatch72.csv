Coffey Brown,"We're in the time where many doors are too hard to enter in
And many people really ain't worth the mentionin'
Thugs, me hugs, and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get antetion then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
that's why I'm here, but boo's, any place or date
If there's tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now that's deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didn't think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin' shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if you're down and my pics on you're wall
Just pop in this song and won't let you fall
To all my ladies, got ya letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear lord left

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

With the kindness of people and most don't even know
'Cause this wilderness was'nt designed to see us grow
My thugs through the years who've always been true
Just know that I take the bullet for you
Life ain't livin' without givin', worth fryin' for lyin'
Ain't jack for free, but I'm supplyin' if you're tryin'
Have friends before the Benz, respect before a Lexus
Mama's(Mama's) gave us life, but brotha's have to protect us(Protect us)
Some wonder why I still got love
Why I still live in the hood, and why I still share grub
Why I play with the kids, lose money on clubs
To keep my people off the streets and away from the slugs
Sometimes rats run traps while our sista's get named
Sometimes bitches do thangs, and our queens get blamed
But I'm puttin' things on blast for my women and G's
'Cause you woulda done the same for me

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

Where's my ladies who support and understand when
Yeah I'm tired but I still gotta visit the pen
I appreciate you love the love I show them
Woulda want the same thing if I had to go in
Lost the love of my life over stress and strife
If I couldn't care for me, I couldn't care for a wife
So I looked at the Lord and what he said was right
""there's obstacles but everything is gonna be alright""
If you feelin' what I'm feelin', lay back and give me love
So when you see me on the streets or clubs give me hug
To understand unity, you gotta understand we
You and I, you and them, them and me, see
y'all did for me, now I'll bow for the royalty
Just to know y'all is the love the loyalty
Behind every strong man there's a strong lady with 'em
Behind me I seem to have a whole nation of women

Why do I shout out all my women and adore my queens?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I destroy anything that stops my teams dreams?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my people is and tell 'em what I see to be?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

Coffin Carousel,"Bleed my thoughts inside of me breathe in light no heresy
Will your feelings lie to me? Instinct? Or bat shit crazy?
Lazy breed’s insanity crazy feeds dependency
Animated without truth abandon hope you hold the proof

Will we break? Did we now know it?
I need time to find your spine
Feel no truth hold back my proof
Clawing my mind shield myself blind

No false light pure intent delight
Black parade rotting heart portrayed
Cracked too late walk with my fate
Rain hollow light remove your spite

Bat shit crazy just smoke your shit baby
Bat shit crazy just ride my face baby

Coffin Carousel,"Scream while you’re still breathing
Feel while you’re still screaming
Save the day by leaving
Love forever hate will now sever
Broken hearts still beating
Broken lies are breeding
Breathe instead of screaming
Free your words now from that feeling

Kicking screaming the wound still keeps bleeding
My heart beat remains so vague
Haunting dreaming and praying for healing
Rising beyond the plague

I will never feel fear
Guided by light so clear
Greater than the feeling
Living my dream innocent and clean
Why are you still waiting?
Always contemplating?
Rebuild the love that’s so pure
Healing the need fear is no cure

Coffin Carousel,"Glamour is no grace absent is your face
The mirror shows no gold why is your heart cold?

Welcome to darkness, follows your sadness
Take what is yours now feel what is real now

And this black light will glow…In a black casino

My heart ache is so low and your heart? Just shallow
Two fools will argue one fool is so true

And this black light will glow…In a black casino

Feel what is real now…what is real now?

Witness your darkness, follow your sadness
Drain love from my vain, follow your sadness

Coffin Carousel,"Is this my time am I choking?
Hear her crying coldness soaking
Loss not warning love not calling
Roses falling hearts not longing

I still feel this it’s time I said so
Take my chances so life unfolds
Are you still there? I hear nothing
Is it time to find my mind?

In my silence I am falling
In my eyes a mirror blurring
Words too violent hearts now crawling
Common sense is not so common

Or rewind? All this time? Please hope be kind

I miss you so much I am craving
To hold you close indeed my darling
My pain will now die inside me
The coffin lies here am I ready?

We lost our hearts lost our restart
Life alone now reflects the past dark
Will light find me or will it blind me?
Time stole my heart today reminds me",The Coffin,2017
Coffin Carousel,"You were born for greatness
Does your life feel so true?
Will you be brave through sadness?
Does honesty devour you?

Broken hearts will mend
Broken bones will fight at life again
Who is my friend?
So loyal I am crawling scared

Did I tell you? Did you think?
Now would you understand?
You hold the answers in your heart
Don’t listen to demands

Dread is my best friend again
Doom will be my bride

They will keep destroying
Lies are the art, art is their lies
They torture always knowing

Let them speak
Let them drown
It’s not your fight
It’s not your crown

Now I am living alive without you
Now I am cleansing the lies told by you

Ignorance is now my bliss
It will remove the guilty
Love is the art art is my love
I’ll rise to my own glory

Living to dream longing for temptation

Is what you seek now so pure?
You will find out your answers

I am the one who falls drowning inside reflecting
All these days contemplating
Lifeless and hidden waiting

Watch the great delusion grow
Parade with the freak show

Still a whisper
Born to scream
Hold your vision
It’s your dream

Never again I will live in a world prevailing
Too many times I felt broken apart restarting
They are the ones left hating
Forever deviating

Why am I feeling hate? (I feel it)
Why do I trust fate? (You feed it)

Coffin Carousel,"We are the united
Born in a world so cold
We are the unwanted
Rejected youth untold

Throw away fall away
All the fear I feel today
Run away torn away
Majestic hearts are here to stay

Whispers to lay your truth
Touch death to feel alive
No cure? Reject the poison!

You are the secret inside your own heartache
You are the strength they will never rise up to break

Torn in a world so old
You are the uninvited

Coffin Carousel,"Crawling on my own
With time I stand proud alone
No trust! What is trust?
And you’re just a prey for my trust

Every step one breath
Every step lays one more test
My heart descending
My ghost from the past now haunting

Cry to the sky and drown my heart
Love too cold to restart
Wipe away all the voices
Throw away all my choices
The light you seek is calling
The raven now pale falling
Think how it felt to feel alive?
Carry me home one last time

My heart still burning
The chaos is sorrow lurking?
Shallow needs hollow this ending?
A wish to swallow

No need will follow
One last time",Pale Raven Sky,2017
Coffin Carousel,"Walk with your horror
Are you a failure?
Did you conquer?
Did you serve your purpose?
Or did your purpose serve up you?

Watching me learn lessons you are yet to see

Secretly you loved sorrow
Awaken truth sleeping hollow

Seeing you tear down false ties around me
Seeing my path to purity unfold me",Sleeping Hollow,2017
Coffin Carousel,"Hold your breath now start breathe
Why didn’t I feel your touch?
Heal the wounds that have shattered me
While I descend do you feel me?

Welcome to this horror show
Watch the shadows move and glow
Stop these haunting screams in my mind
Ice cold chill drips down my spine
Why are we now lost in time?
Nowhere to run under the moonlight

Feeling just so cherry this time
I never listened to the voice from your mind
Feel the touch and cold blast of time
What we don’t want is what we will now find

Resist to feel what is real to you
While the smoke still clears does life fool you?
Thank those hearts that have lifted you
The hollow truth will soon feed you

What we don’t want is what we will now find
Feeling just so cherry this time",So Cherry,2017
Coffin Carousel,"Do you hear the voices?
Drowning all your choices
I bleed who will find me?
Have some toxic candy
Time to start this party
Live to trust inside me
I feed what will starve me
No more toxic candy

Can’t separate my past
Show me what will last
Everlasting hearts
Will rise again to star
Can’t feel my trust inside
My every thought collides
Time awake them bones
Sleepwalkers swarm the drones

Does death still hold my bones?
My feeling now it owns
The coldness melts inside
My path through fear collides
No more will I run now
The game has changed this clown
Tomorrow lets me know
And tomorrow I will show

This doom will pop
My doom it drops",Toxic Candy,2017
Coffin Carousel,"There’s no turning back
What’s done is well done
To get caught in no act
Is half of no fun?

Time to find out who controls you?
Feel their needles pinch within you
Scream to feed the force that heals you

Voodoo Riot Voodoo Riot

Push your pin deep
Feel desire weep

Time found out who and controlled you

You have felt this all along
The choice is left all to you
What choice will you choose?

Hear your inner voice and scream it
Feel your hollow heart and feed it

There’s candy in your skull so scream it!

You still feel you don't belong
You have felt this way too long
Choice was left all for you (it’s too late)
What choice have you frozen?

Never will a lie tell a truth so true

All that time is gone let the pain awaken you",Skull Candy,2017

A victim to our fathers lost war
The restless children sit and mourn the graves
Of those they've never seen before
Will they be buried here among the dead?
In the silent secret

The pioneers
In dealing with it they march for dawn, of Will and worthy
The truth be told the child was born

Man your own jackhammer
Man your battle stations
We'll have you dead pretty soon
Sincerely written from my brother's blood machine
Man your own battle station
We'll have you home pretty soon

Awake through motion with curiosity to curtain your first move
Over arm's length they'll break protocol
Jealous envy for the youngest one
To be the hero is all I'll ask
Can I be buried here among the dead?
With room to honor me here in the end
You'll be better off too soon
You'll be better off when you get home

The pioneers
In dealing with it they march for dawn, for Will and worthy
The truth be told the child was born

Sincerely written from my brother's blood machine
Man your own battle station
We'll have you home pretty soon

For you
I'd do anything 
Just to make you happy
Hear you tell me that you're proud of me
For them
I'll kill anything
Cut the throats of babies for them
Break their hearts for they were them
Waiting for you to say
""I love you too""

Do the children really understand 
The things you did to them?
And why, oh why?
Should they conjure up the will? 
For you, my love, I would kill him 

We're coming home pretty soon
Coming home

In the seventh turning hour
Will the victims shadow fall?
Should the irony grow hungry? 
With the victory and all they sought for
We were one among the Fence

We're coming home

A cautious ear to the mouth of your confession
Think of all the things we put him through
In the face of his God would he tell the truth?

Still recorded were the words that dribbled out his kiss
When eyes go blind in this man of what could once become
Sever the limbs off his torso in sleep
And burn what remains so the world may now see

No longer, will we wait for your answers
Back to the hell where you've come from
Think of all the times you've once had
Write them in a letter that says goodbye

You'll listen to reason while you're face down in the dirt
You'll stomach the hurt and break for him here just how much he's worth

Slowly discarded were the remains of his lonely youth
Among the alley where the dwellers scare to notice
Picture a young boy in pieces and streets with leveled malfunctions
No name to be called redeemer

We'll fix him restore him, with the love if no other
Think of all the things you did before
Write them in a letter that says reborn

You'll listen to reason while you're face down in the dirt
You'll stomach the hurt and break for him here just how much he's worth
Following you across the interstate walking away, I'll fire on

On the causeway to never where

But I thought of it so
Like there's no other way it could've been done

For a puzzle I wish not to play a part in it
A heart stained in hate,
A feeling of fear will play circles

But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

I severed my ties
To shroud this body under the streets of this city
And wait for the day
When I am summoned to walk across the face
Well, slowly but clearer now,
In visiouns that play and plague memories
I loved them with all
All as the son should to mother and father

But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

And I walk through the door,
Shaping the light of all life
With our eyes and reform,
Would I com as before
Pray you're not the only one
Pray you're not the only
If I form mistakes, would I take them back
If erasing them could, if erasing them would
But would they be the words that I would say
Your face and a door between
I've parted three ways
For you, the Newo that I love

Did you ever really know before

Did you ever really know before

Did you, did you,
did you come clean in the end from the son?

About to change for the better

And if there's one good thing that comes from my away
It's that you won't be anything like me

Coi Mattison,"We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell

Every Sunday dressin' up, catchin' gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the First Chapter and Second Verse
If we all God's children then what's the word of the reverend worth

Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facin' time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy, it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly

Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryin' to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law accordin' to politicians

Who was King James, and why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessin' not a curse
I learned that heaven and hell exist right here on Earth, word

Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads
That Hell is called Babylon
And that's where them crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinkin' that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan

So it all sound the same to me, that's why when they say
One is right and the other is wrong, it just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No, that ain't vain to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see

The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual and recognize
That life is full of miracles, you could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine 'cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who lookin' for God knowin' to go inside

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup

Livin' in mass confusion, lookin' for absolution
The gas induces psychopath, produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were sayin'
Tryin' to get to God but ended up doin' the work of Satan

Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make the rules of faith that you condition to
And gotta to follow and God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto
Then you know it well

[Incomprehensible] after me
Preacher says, he's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation

[Incomprehensible] you
I pray that God hears you
Take one look at your rear view
And if you see what I see
[Incomprehensible]

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go
You think it's bad here on Earth
But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

It's all goin' to hell
It's all goin' to hell
Yup, we livin' in hell
Yup, they givin' us hell

We know that what we reap we sow
But we forget how low we can go

But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell

Stand up straight and act my age 
Life is a book and this is the first page 
Love, is what I see 
I think it's time that I reach my peak 
Every night can't eat and sleep 
'Cause I'm thinking of a love to keep 
I brought steal, but I refuse to stop 
My search goes on until I drop 
Gotta be somebody, I'm there

We 're flying right up to the sky
We fly so high
We're flying right up to the sky

We fly so high, we fly so high

Cause that's the kind of stuff that makes a mess 
Breakin' me down and takin' me to the test 
Keepin' me brother from givin' my best 
Gotta chill gotta chill gotta gotta kill 
Before I cannot feel anything that's goin' down 
Turnin' my head around and around 
Takin' me to the highest level 
Diggin' my own grave with a shovel 
Many boss remain in my brain 
Cover me truly and sing. 
I cannot speak, I cannot speak 
I wake up sweatin' up in my sleep 
That's why, that's why I'm flyin' high.

We're flying high (We're flying high) 
We're flying right up to the sky 
We fly so high (We fly so high) 
We're flying right up to the sky

The stars are shining round and round 
So high we're flying right up to the sky. 
We're flying high (We fly so high, we fly so high) 
We're flying high. 

Yeah that's the way I got to go 
When everybody's singin' my mo and mo 
Pickin' up the record in a record store 
Hollywood, Hollywood on the radio 
Jammin', jammin' forty people bang me 
It's me and gets his slam in right 
So why don't you play all night 
Puttin' on the jeans and the jeans all tight 
Gotta go gotta go gotta go now 
Try to relax and I don't know how 
Listenin' to the sound I like to hear best 
The sound that makes me cheer 
I'm gettin' away from a everyday cry 
Runnin' away from hardcore lie 
I'm flyin', I'm flyin' high.

I told you so
Listen to me
Ain't nothing changed
So don't expect for me to leave

[Bridge]
I never made you think there was love
I never said there's a chance for us
So there's no need for you to catch feelings for me
What will it take for you to give up?
How could you possibly love so much?
But there can't be anything between you and me

[Chorus]
There never was a time when I loved you
There never was a chance that I gave you
So how could you be loving me when I never loved you?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Don't try and break up my happy home
What must I do for you to see
That there's no you and me?

One year has gone by
So why do you keep on calling me?
I told you the last time
That me and you could never be
Time has gone by
And still you try
To get with me
No questions why
Don't try to find
A place with me

'Cause I really wanna be with you
Say it's so, till the end of time your love is all I know
'Cause I really wanna be with you

When I'm all alone
I surround myself with every thought of you
I love the things you do, yeah

Your love gently lays me down
Turns me all around, makes me love you once again
Yeah, one kiss, lips upon my face
Nothing could erase, everything you are

All we have is a love we share and that's enough for me
'Cause I really wanna be with you
In a thousand years if I lost your love
I'd cry a thousand tears, I'd cry a thousand tears, yeah

Your love gently lays me down
Turns me all around, makes me love you once again, yeah
One kiss, lips upon my face
Nothing could erase, everything you are

Just one look in your eyes makes me melt inside
And I know when you're holding me close
It's for real, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're the love that I've wanted to stand the test of time
And I know in my heart, you will always be mine

Your love gently lays me down
Turns me all around, makes me love you once again
One kiss, lips upon my face, ooh baby
Nothing could erase, everything, everything

Everything you are gently lays me down
Turns me all around, makes me love you once again
One kiss, lips upon my face
Come on and kiss me, baby

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Altho' it's been said many times many ways

His law is love and His gospel is peace
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt its worth
(A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices)
(For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn)

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease
With hymns of joy

In grateful chorus
Let every heart, adore His name
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Colacho Mendoza,"Ese muchacho que yo quiero tanto 
Ese que yo regaño a cada rato 
Me hizo acordar ayer 
Que así era yo también cuando muchacho 
Que sólo me aquietaban dos pengazos 
Del viejo Rafael 

Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 
Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 

Se ponía triste al verme llorar 
Y me daba un pedazo de panela 
Y entraba en discusión con mi vieja 
Por que la pobre le reclamaba 
Que porque diablos me maltrataba 
Que dejara al muchacho tranquilo 

Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 
Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 

Recuerdo la cartilla abecedario 
El primer día que al pueblo me mandaron 
Porque era día de fiesta 
Recuerdo que iba tan entusiasmado 
Por que desde que me habían bautizado 
No llegaba a la iglesia 

El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 
El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 

Ese fue el día que le escuche al padre 
Que dios a todos nos tiene en cuenta 
Y con deseos también de quedarme 
Pa' allá en la nocha de la caseta 
Y me tocó quedarme en la puerta 
No tenia plata para pagarles 
Por eso es que la vida es un baile 
Que con el tiempo damos la vuelta 
Pero el tiempo acaba la fiesta 
Y me voy solito pa'l valle 

Yo aprendí a trabajar desde pela'o 
Por eso es que yo estoy acostumbrado 
Siempre a vivir con plata 
Y con toda la plata que he ganado 
Cuántos problemas no he solucionado 
Pero nunca me alcanza 

Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 
Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 

Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero
Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero 

Por eso Rafael Santos yo quiero 
Dejarte dicho en esta canción 
Que si te inspira ser zapatero 
Sólo quiero que seas el mejor 
Por que de nada sirve el doctor 
Si es el ejemplo malo del pueblo 

Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy

It's hard to let go of the past, but it seems easier as time is movin'

Never wanna let you break my own

That we probably didn't mean

I'm shrouded beneath my fear and doubt
And I don't need it

Cause I'm walkin' down this road alone
And figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you, is you my love
My head is in a cloud of rain and the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for the droplets, droplets

You left a mark
I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best
When I'm with you
Everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret and I don't need it

Like the OLB we call 'em oldies
In your melodies, I'm hearing things you never told me

We stay in tune with each other,
In our room we'll discover new ways to do covers,
No matter how they dub us
We should stay true to the trust
And the winner of the best duo is us

Colbie Caillat,"I remember like yesterday
I carried a heart without hope
I'd given up on mystery
I only saw mirrors and smoke
Thought I was fine alone
It's just because I didn't know

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces
Sitting with you on a crowded bus
Seemed like just the two of us
That night everything was changed
I remember like yesterday

I was living in black and white,
A careful and colorless life
You are like a neon light
Shining through my closed eyes
All the ""right ones"" they turned out wrong
But you were here all along

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces
Little folded up love letters
Sweet songs written for each other
Everything was about to change
I remember like yesterday

You came just in time for me
Changed my mind so easily
Now it's you and me

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
We were friends in different places
Then love began leaving traces
For the first time I love you
On a Paris afternoon
And now everything has changed
I remember like yesterday

I remember like yesterday
Loving you seemed far away
Thought I could live without you
So glad I finally found you
On the street in the pouring rain
Our lives both found their wings
I love how everything changed
I remember cause it's today

But Christmas in the sand don't end
I tell you that's where it's at

Hawaiian Tropic on my skin
A candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

I must have had too much to drink
'Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green, I think
He was playing reindeer games on me
Santa only called him once
But you should've seen him run so fast
They were gone in a dash

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa

Don't need your winter coat
Don't need your winter hat
Just grab the one you love
And say you're never coming back

If you see Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
It's what he did to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two

I don't think I'd spend my last hours at an altar
Or somewhere making toasts to good old days.

Is watch the world end with you.

I'd lay down in a field by your side
And watch every star falling out of the sky,
And I'd steal a kiss from your sweet lips one last time,
And I wouldn't be afraid as long as your hand was in mine.

And you want me to love you
But every time I try to
Ooh the feelings ain't there

I can be a friend like we used to be
Like we were right from the start
I can be right there when you call me up
Even a million miles apart

See, I gave you every part of me that I could
But the one thing I can't give you
Is my heart

Colby O'Donis,"Hey girl, have you seen her?
When's Minnie gonna get here?
Well, I thought she'd be here by now
Yeah, the party's no fun without Minnie Mouse!
Is she in? Is she in? Is Minnie in?
When Minnie walks in then the fun begins!
The place is hummin', drummin', waitin' for her
When's she gonna get here?
We all adore her
The whole place sounds like a beehive buzzin'
'Cause in here she's the Queen Bee-lieve me...
Me too!
Me three!
We're talkin', talkin', talkin' about her
I wish she'd hurry up, it's no fun without her!
Have you heard? Have you heard?
Have you heard what's the word?
The word is Minnie! Minnie!
Yeah, Minnie's the one we're waitin' for
To soar through the door and score on the dance floor
Yo! Check it out! Catch the spin
Put a grin on your chin 'cause Minnie is in!
CHORUS
Minnie Mouse, Minnie Mouse
Minnie Mouse is in the house
Now Minnie's here and it's a mouse house party
Go tell it to Michael and Mona and Marty
Gonna twirl, gonna swirl, and ride the groove
And when you see her you've got to...
Move!
Move, baby, move to the motion
Of the soundwaves like an ocean
Now I'm thinkin', don't just stand there blinkin'
She just walked in all pretty and pink and...
Presto!
Change-o!
Hocus Pocus!
She's a polka-dot princess, she's got the focus
She sticks with Mick through thick and thin
So put a grin on your chin 'cause Minnie is in!
CHORUS
Now you know no one would ever dis her
If she went away, we would really miss her
The dance floor is her
Heart and soul territory
That's her story
The story of Minnie Mouse
Minnie Mouse
In the house
In the house
Mick's girlfriend is in the mix
So, take a chance an'
Take a glance an'
Catch her dancin'
Prancin
All the night and all the day
And you know what I'm going to say
Say when Minnie's here then the fun begins
So put a grin on your chin...
'Cause Minnie is in!

Colby O'Donis,"Hey
Hmm, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa

Behind every good man
There's a woman
She never lets me down
Makes me feel so
Good
When she's loving me
Man it's like
Whoa, whoa, whoa
She's my ride or die
Twenty-four, seven
Three, sixty-five
So no matter what is
Facing me
She finds a way to give me strength
For her I'll wait
A life
But I can't go tonight
Without hearing the voice of an angel

The difference is
She makes the world a little better
The difference is
She makes it hurt a little less
The difference is
She can take away the pressure
The closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference
Now find one right now
You'll walk a little better
You'll talk a little better
You'll eat a little better
You'll dress a little better
She's the closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference
Hey, she makes the difference

She lets the weight
Right off of my shoulders
And with this girl
I could picture growing
Older
And if you got
One like mine
Better pull her
Closer
Don't play the cool guy
You'll lose ya chance
To show her
She promises the
Best for me
A hundred percent
She expects from me
That's why I'm
For life
To see her
Every night
And feel the touch
The touch of an angel

If ya see a girl like mine
Don't push her away

To the rules you might wanna call it obsession but this to my heart
It's just a natural progression and I know that she and me can work things out,
If things get tough, that's why shes a keeper that's why shes a keeper.

[Bridge]
No one but you seems to get me they try to sweat me saying baby make
Me cum bed me even if they sexy it don't matter cause my heart won't
Let me put my other feelings aside, and I don't care what the other
Guys say they just jealous cause they don't have you,
They don't have you girl, they they they don't have you girl.

[Chorus]
Baby they wanna take you away from me, but that's not gonna happen not
To us oh no, they wanna take you away from, but the bond we have is stronger
Than they know, they wanna take you away from me, I ain't your average Joe,
They wanna take you away, they they wanna take they wanna take take you away.

[Verse 2]
I never thought that I'd let this get to me, telling all my friends she and
I would never be closer than what all they expected but I still made sure
That she was always respected, cause I know she possibly could be the one
If things get tough that's why shes a keeper that's why shes a keeper

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Cause it's it's official official girl, now that you be in my world,
In my world your my crystal no no girl be looking fly cause your the one
That got my eye, come and set it off, let it let it off, I'll never stop
If you stick by my side,

[Romeo]
Shes such a vibrant thing a vibrant thing how she work that thing
And twurk that thing and I give a chance so she could hang with a boss
For days and still no name, kellis chick ya shes kinda bossy,
I never did time cause them years'll cost me new six ain't color of coffee
And I stay iced out like my name was frosty, see shorty she the different
Type take home to mother might make ya wife, walk like a model but the
Thugish type pops taught the game so I play it right, she with me and I'm
Labeled a prince, you ain't never had a girl like this, no no, Colby o

Colby O'Donis,"First kiss, when I touched your lips I admit I was nervous baby,
My friend, the only one that I could share my heart with baby,
We rushed too fast into this, only in time will tell
Cause we don't know if love will affect our friendship, it's a risk though,
It's a risk that I want to take, cause baby you know
That I'll never leave your side cause girl I've realized that

You've been under my nose, my nose
After everything we've been through,
You've been under my nose, my nose
I can't believe I overlooked you,
Right under my nose my nose
Momma I had you steady searching,
For something that's been here all along

It was like I was panning for gold,
When I had a diamond mine just waiting at home
It took forever to see that you were the match for me
I never saw this coming, no (I love you baby)
Can't stop it's not exactly the truth, I've always been attracted to you
But I didn't want to ruin what we had, the thought of losing you, it made me sad
We rushed too fast into this, only in time will tell

She was looking for a helping hand, a man to change a tire
We hit it off and we talked forever and I bought that girl a ring
Then quicker than a Richard Petty pit stop, I got down on one knee and said

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track

Till I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and being between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life

You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where the niggas load clips and fats
And get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbanin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside

All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life, you never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

R.I.P to KMG
Still gotta murder rap, and don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building I just give a fuck where the money at
They coaching the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays and if you get a train better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta, y'all testin my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a capre

(Wait, hold up I got next)
(What up X)
Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, oh you fucks guess what, I'm ready to blow
(Yo, oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors scrapin' bumpin' in the driveway
You gave me the pistol told me to kill at will
(Blow, yo, oh no)
(I couldn't give a fuck)
Literally, cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities

But I know I got that shit)
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitches niggas from runnin' their mouth
(It's bout time somebody said something)

One in the glove, one in the clip, one in the chamber
One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger
I'm ready to die I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit, somebody better fuckin' stop me

How there were no V-day heroes in nineteen seventhy-three 
How we sailed into Sydney Harbor
Saw an old friend but couldn't kiss her
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land

And she was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty, till they found their chosen one
And their legs were often open
But their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, pay packet lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
Car parks made me jumpy
And I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and Novocaine

So I worked across the country end to end
Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend
Held a job on an oil-rig
Flying choppers when I could
Oh but the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend

And I've traveled round the world from year to year
And each one found me aimless, one more year the more for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia
But the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting north, to check things out again, yeah I am

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong
There ain't nothing like the kisses
From a jaded Chinese princess
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And it's really got me worried
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm in a hurry
And the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone

Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And it's really got me worried
I'm goin' nowhere and I'm in a hurry

Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

And leave in its place a note to explain
All of the reasons that stealing has led me to leave

May I be so bold as to say

Is as sinful as throwing away

And the sweat of my brow drips to my shaking knees

Name a bit like that place, where the famous
Get so out of their face, they die of fatal
Cocktails all chemically mace, we'll be
Rubbing shoulders with the stars in outer
Space.

There'll be seven-foot women there, five
O'clock shadow rammed into ladies under-
Wear and the animals go in two by two,
Into the circus, into the zoo, into the loo.

And hog boars snuffle with curly pig tails,
Guest list cysts leaving trails like snails,
There'll be the pierced, the piercing screaming
Studs, fiercer than Elvis, pure phets no duds.

Jesus, but pornographic.
Oh do! Yes lets! Lets go to that new place,
With the name like the place where the
Glamorous died, and user friendly all are we,

Says, you don't have to pay because he's a
Member, wearing nothing but a peanut in the
Middle of December. 

Suddenly, I'm on top form
And terribly bright, glitter, tinsel, sparkle me
Baby, every night, I'm an extraordinarily curious
Creature and I know it, how bohemian! Shush
For the poet, nah fuck that! Let's go to the loo,
Like animals two by two, and what was it
You said you do? Is there any way I can
Network with you?

So you tell me about a movie you're making, hopefully making,
Hopefully making, starring Uma Thurman, hopefully making,
Hopefully.

And you talk for too long, then you say, I love this song, must
Shake a leg on the dance floor, with that fashion type wild boar,
And she needs an apple stuffed into her fat gob. Oh look! It's that junky
Lead singer, I hear he's a nob,
Well, I know him actually and he's alright, going solo and
Good for a line every night.

Oh! Come, give me more, give me more to consume, I'm fatter
Than Elvis and cheekier than Jesus in this VIP room, with the
Super models, the rock stars and the superfly.

Then she said, morbidly,
Now would be a good place to die.
Out of my face, in the place with the name like that place, on the
Front page tomorrow, my face, headline reading mystery death
In new place.

For she was best top lover girlfriend of that guy with the chart
Topping hits, that actress, that director and that model with the
Fabulous tits. Then everyone will want to go to that place, because
It has a name like that place, where you get so out of your face,

So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money

But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great! so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this

Feelin' out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric be	, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish

'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
To now test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full",Paid in Full (Coldcut Remix),2007
Coldcut,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais

Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in daylight

Yeah we were dying of frustration
Saying ""Lord lead me not into temptation""
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Since they gone

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only, God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So, up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
There's only screaming
Let the windows, down
As I crawl to the ground

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes

Shattered windows and the sound of drums

So we go through the ?
Next thing you know
You're the first one to leave 'cause

I'm gonna be the one to win this fight (win this fight)

I ain't thinking bout you
Cause I gotta think about me
And if you wear me down
Can't get up, got the best you see, so
Can't go out like that
It's like a monkey on my back
You can't stop this stress
I'm tired of your mess
End up like the rest

You know, I've been down for you, but you
Consistently, fuck it
You treat me like a housewife
All maid and chef
Why you sit around here like you do heck
A woman? Nah you need a blowup doll
A chick like me, I was born to ball
I'm a chick with her own doe for the mall
I'm a chick with her own cell making calls
Drop off, black Benz when I'm loving hard
Get over your selfish ass on the beach in ?

I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga

I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school
And you will never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search of, did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring

I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must
I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit
I said ""Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant""
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, yellin' out ""unpark it""
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick
It's young T

I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand

And I don't really think y'all cool

No, no, give yourself a hand

Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action

We made love in the dead of winter

And those crows and fields
Yeah we set them all on fire
But there was nothing left
When we were done, no nothing left, oh

And do you ever think about me
'Cause I think about you all the time?
We burn so bright, we tore all through the night
And sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?

There was danger and wonder in your eyes
But you felt as free as the big blue sky

And sometimes when the cold night comes
You blow into my mind
And you want my bones all like brand new wine
Just like brandy wine, yeah

Do you ever think about me
'Cause I think about you all the time?
We burn so bright, we tore all through the night
Sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?

There's a place where those young lovers are still together
We ran away to a world past forever, oh oh, yeah

Do you ever think about me
'Cause I think about you all the time?
We burn so bright that we tore all through the night
Sometimes when you dream, do you think about me?

'Cause I think about you
You're always on my mind all the time

Cole Deggs & the Lonesome,"She's working at an office
Where nobody ever notices a thing she does
She knows that it's because
She ain't the kind you see in a magazine

The men keep talking about
Basketball and coffee, never bat an eye
Whenever she walks by

But at 5 o' clock in the parking lot
Her husband's waiting by the car
And she can't wait to see his face light up

Everybody's beautiful to someone
Everybody's beautiful to someone
She might not do much for you, son
But you should see what she does for someone else

Saturday morning and your wife says
She's going out to buy some eggs
While she slides her legs
Into her jeans with the ripped up knees

You're thinking to yourself
That she will look a little better
If her hair was long
Just a touch of make up on

When she smiles at you, says, ""Be back soon""
You don't know she's going
Just to hear the sack boy say, ""Hey, here she comes""

Everybody's beautiful to someone
Everybody's beautiful to someone
When she don't do much for you, son
You should see what she does for someone else

She might not do much for you, son
Everybody's beautiful to someone
Oh, everybody's beautiful to someone
She might not do much for you, son
Oh, but everybody is beautiful to someone

Yeah, you got to know
Oh, you got to hold her and kiss her and touch her
'Cause she's beautiful

I can’t describe it and words can’t say
I pulled myself out of the game
Maybe tonight, I should learn how to play

See, I don’t mind waitin' for a girl like you
No, I don’t mind waitin' for a girl like you

I caught your eye, clear crystal blue
Been swimmin' inside, drownin', nothin' I can do
Take all the time that you need to
Give me your heart, I’ll save mine for you

See, I don’t mind waitin' for a girl like you

Second chances don’t come often
So I’m takin' my walk

Cole Deggs & the Lonesome,"Justine, it's only me out here standing outside your door tonight. 
I took a chance and stopped and knocked when I saw your light. 
I know you think I'm drunk or I'm crazy but I had to talk to you 
To help you to see you don't know me as well as you think you do. 

I got more than this heart of mine 
Way more than you'll ever find 
In all those boys who hang around your door 
More love than you've ever known 
More strength than I've ever shown 
Whatever it is you think you're looking for 
I got more 

You look at me and see an old plow boy. 
Hey baby that's OK 
Proud of my roots, my muddy boots, I grew up that way. 
Girl if you dig a little bit deeper I think you'll be surprised. 
Give me some time, some of your time, and I'll prove to you tonight. 

That I've got more in this heart of mine 
Way more than you'll ever find 
In all those boys who hang around your door 
More love than you've ever known

Cole Deggs & the Lonesome,"I can see her on that sliver sand
Dancing to the local band
With the big red sun sinking down
She's the show attracting the crowd

Hey

Well, I fell hard and I fell fast
If it wasn't for me it would've last
But the fool in me broke her heart
She tore out of town leaving all these parts
To Alabama

Hey, what I gotta do to get heart back on the highway?
Coming my way soon
Hey, what I gotta say to talk her into my arms
Back to Texas, Arkansas, out of Alabama

Yeah, nothing against the crimson tide
I just need that girl here by my side
And I know if I get my way
Alabama's gonna be crying that day

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Coming my way soon
Hey, what I gotta say to talk her into my arms
Back to Texas, Arkansas, out of Alabama

She should be with the one that loves her most
