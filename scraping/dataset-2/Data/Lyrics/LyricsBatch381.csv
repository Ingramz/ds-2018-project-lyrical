Incubus,"7 am
The garbage truck
Beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about
What I've thrown away
Could I push rewind?
All the credits strewn
In signifying the end
But I missed the best part
Could we please go back
To the start?
Forgive my indecision

Then again, then again, then again
You're always first when
No one's on your side
Then again, then again, then again
The day will come when
I want off that ride

11 am
By now you would think
That I would be up
But my bedsheets shade
The heated choices I made
What did I find?
I never thought I could want
Someone so much
'Cause now you're not here
And I'm knee deep
In my own fear
Forgive my indecision
I am only a man

Then again, then again, then again
You're always first when
No one's on your side
Then again, then again, then again
The day will come when
I want off that ride

12 pm and my dusty telephone rings
I get up from my pillow
Who could it be?
I hope its you
It's you, oh

Then again, then again, then again
You're always first when
No one's on your side
Then again, then again, then again
The day has come and
I want off that ride",11am,2001
Incubus,"I'm floating down a river
Oars freed from their homes long ago
Lying face up on the floor
Of my vessel
I marvel at the stars
And feel my heart overflow

Further down the river

Two weeks without my lover
I'm in this boat alone
Floating down a river named emotion
Will I make it back to shore?
Or drift into the unknown

Further down the river

I'm building an antenna
Transmissions will be sent
When I am through
Maybe we can meet again
Further down the river
And share what we both discovered
Then revel in the view

Further down the river

I'm floating down a river",Aqueous Transmission,2001

Incubus,"I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground

Hand over my heart I swear,
I've tried everything I could within all my power
2 weeks and 1 hour
I slaved and now I've got nothing to show
Oh if only you've grown taller than a brick wall
From now on
Gonna start holding my breath
When you
Come around and you flex that fake grin
Cause something inside me has said more than twice
That breathing this air
Beats breathing you at all

I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground

Hand over my mouth
I'm earning the right to my silence
In quiet discerning between ego and timing
Good judgment is once again proving to me
That its still worth its weight in gold
From now on I'm gonna be so much more weary
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
Seeing you is like pulling teeth
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil

I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue every time you come around
Cause blood in my mouth beats blood off the ground

By saying less today
I will gain more, gain more
No tears to you my, my fickle friend
You you brought the art of silent war

I looked pathetic and as helpless as a stinger without a bee
But underneath my presentation. Yeah
I knew the walls were coming down
And the stones that fell were aiming away from me

Hey what would it mean to you?
To know that it'll come back around again
Hey whatever it means to you
Know that everything moves in circles

I saw you standing in my headlights Blink blink blink
I thought Id run you down for the weight you left on me
But then I pressed rewind, reversed and drove away
And see you, disappear in my rear view
Brought to me the word reciprocity

Something I noticed when the light was just right

Could you show me dear?
Something I'm not seeing
Something infinitely interesting

And kiss you lovers lips

I want to stay inside for good
I want to stay inside for good for good for good for good

And everything they say
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait
But the better part of me knows
That waiting in the throws
Is on a par with reading while my eyes are closed

""what can I do""? you say
""its just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips!""

But I'm enjoying the illusion and the things my body says

The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away.
Could I push rewind?
The credits traverse signifying the end but I missed the best part.
Could we please go back to start?

Forgive my indecision
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side.
But then again, a day will come when I want off that ride.

Eleven a.m.,
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bedsheets shade the heat of choices I've made.
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in
That old fear.

Forgive my indecision... I am only a man
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side.

I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins

I don't miss it all that much

Asides from gettin in you, the words will stain you
Permanent like ink in epidermis, from tattoo artists
To scar this, thought of partnership you may have fought
For this position and status, this entrepeneurship
Matter of fact, madness I planned this like serial killers are banished
Flows aquatic like fishes' surroundings, underground and
It's pounding, like pregnancies, with the expectancy
Of three times three, use my mental nine to climb
Like gladiator on wall, on call like physicians
To deliver my labor you savor the flavor like Punisher to the cure
A parent's birth picture, evade mixture of offspring
Ring ring the alarm, cause I set strong cases of fire
From my wire connections and disconnections
To settin sparks cause then I'm wettin, microphone checkin
Disrespectin amateurs plus they mentors don't be a sore sport
If it's meant yours, just pretend I liked yours

I don't just flip shit anyone can kid, I stick the landing
And stand out, amongst most so don't stress
Trying to touch us, you can't come close like phone sex
I stay ahead of the pack, if you fuckin with Treds
Know that I cover the spread so always bet on black
I'll give you your money's worth, serve up somethin delicious
While, most of these rappers be makin my tummy hurt
Got me upset, sick of these crabs who can't kick it
All addicted to rhyming, I'ma stick them in rehab
Get em cleaned up you know, show em the light that they're
All bark and no bite, like a tree trunk

Suckers are finished, may they flow, rest in pieces
Cause we're dominating, so while they're busy happy
Just to be nominated son, we give acceptance speeches

For infinite wisdom seeker knowledge of life rhyme provider

To master one-twenty-four bits at ninety-six KhZ
While you just now trying to get up on Dungeon D&D
Thinking Indelibles will crash and burn you must be lazy and obscene
We fire sequential flyers, my verse ?provides wrecks in concert D?
Slingin em 40 bottles frozen from rooftops and projects
Beware watch below for falling objects, rupturing your optical
Two one-hundred watt mono blocks is optional
To try to match wits with the Diamondback unstoppable
Background poseurs fiend for limelight exposure
When we rally back touch the microphone playtime is over
Who's trying to see the CF graf crew that visualize
Top to bottom, and stand out in New York like an L.A. gang tag do
Master of mathematical empirical principal
Metallic medicinal, mixed with herbs, science and mineral
Yo crews start to walk, when we crack the five series hood
Disengage the ?passive, rip open an issue casing?

Chill let me stop, gotta get my joint dislodged
And retire armies of niggas, with my dishonorable discharge
And get real, pulling from deep and you gots to play up?
You talk about, ""Respect mines,"" steady missin your layups
Hoes to foes, I start staring, wild truculant
Heart tearing style, fuck you then, order your demise
I'm well stocked, shell shocked, describin the bombs alarms

Enlist as, from small pox to syphillis, all stars

Only buck fifty you ever handed out was with a Metro card
I can fit the sum of your Tom Thumb concepts in a thimble
Simple bitches, Doctor Death lacing barbed wire stitches
A herd of mad cows bust through brick walls like Jumanji

Right-Wingers turned leftist, everybody jumped on the dick of independence

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1999

Blood drying on my hands it's really nothing new
The betrayal that I felt because I loved you
And I sit here all alone in the dark
Heart pounding filled with pain (oh the pain)
And I put the razor to her neck
Slash out she screams in vain
And she knew what I was gonna do
No way to identify her now that I'm through
But I swear she knew what I was gonna do

I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Midnight, one dream one chance of coming
The heat of this one choice, the weakness of one voice
Doors that open to sights so uncertain
My heart's open steady with magic get ready, go

This is no different then the other times
But my heart says, ""Make this mine""
You ask me how I know this is the night
'Cuz The future's in your eyes

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Give it up

Melting, past rooftops this feeling that can't stop
The state of the night here, the pleasure of no fear
So long and so kind and so hard yet so fine
I'm not acting steady so I must be ready now, ready to go

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

India,"Oyeme, hija
Voy a hablarte de tu padre
Ese cobarde que a las dos abandono
Palabras dulces como miel supo decirme
Why asi mi vida, sin pensar, yo le entregue

Lo conoci en uno de sus viajes
Me enamoro con su elocuencia why su condor
Juro que junto a mi siempre viviria
Era de adas el cuento que pinto

Cuando le dije que en mi vientre era ese fruto
De la pasion why el sentimientro entre los dos
Me prometio que por nosotros el seria
El fiel guardian de nuestro amor

Pero esa ilusion poco iba a durar
Porque se marcho, nunca mas volvio
Why por eso nunca perdone
Que hundio mi vida con su felonia

Al que conoces no es en realidad tu padre
Las circumstancias me hicieron mentir
Todo este tiempo lo guarde, era un secreto
Dios me bendijo con tenerte a ti

Hija te digo porque debes saberlo
Tienes la edad donde es muy facil dar amor
Solo te pido toma en cuenta mi experiencia
No quiero verte burlada como yo

No desilucion, no quiero mas traicion
Tienes que escuchar para ser feliz
Why asi nunca sufriras como yo sufri
Burlada inocencia

(Perdona hija lo tarde why el error, no quize para ti tanto dolor)
No quize ocultarte la verdad
Eras muy pequeña para entender la realidad
(Perodna hija lo tarde why el error, no quize para ti tanto dolor)
Yo era muy joven why creia en el

Pense que me queria why no era fiel
(Perdona hija lo tarde why el error, no quize para ti tanto dolor)
Padre no es el que hare, es el que cria
El que te da amor dia con dia

(Se marcho!)
Se marcho!
(No volvio!)
No volvio!
(Eran cuentos de adas lo que me pinto)
Eran cuentos de amor why pasion
Hipocrecia, mentira

(Se marcho!)
Se marcho!
(No volvio!)
No volvio!
(Eran cuentos de adas lo que me pinto)
Pero hija a pesar de ser burlada inocencia
Tuve que sacrificarme!
Why seguir adelante!

Escucah las palabras que te digo
(Burlada inocencia no)
Yo no quiero que pase lo mismo contigo
(Burlada inocencia no)

Toma en cuenta mi experiencia
(Burlada inocencia no)
Es que burlada no quiero verte
(Burlada inocencia no)
NO! No quiero verte, Ay! No quiero, verte sufrir

Now it's India, India, I get into ya, styles I got plenty 'a
I'm bout it bout it, you know my ones stay crowded
Fuck around and doubt it, and get that ass louded
The future me, 2003, ultra magnetic, this MC... (MCs, MCs, MCs freeze)
I'm not afraid of you niggas, I'm ready for the masses
I keep it tight like spandex do asses
Palmer's cocoa butter for the ashes, while Chanel laces up my lashes
Uh oh no, stop! It don't get hot because I locked it
Got it, give me 6 million like you gave Tupac it
Hot forever 'coz that's how I plotted

verse 2 (G. Salah)
I'm that are rated nigga from the films with mistique
With taste from the hamptoms but still street
Don't sleep I reach the ghetto to elite
Blessed with the vocals gifted with the feet
Pretty nigga, pearly white teethe
I can't for now 'coz my mind says from Asia
I'm unreachable, fuck a portable and pager
Made nigga, no time for posin', leavin' niggas like Moses
Front and get swollen The black italian G. Salah the chosen
I beat you down with love get you stuck frozen
'Coz I talk shit like caches, and I backs it
Can you match this my magic
Catcy like habits, digest and swallow

Belle Venezuela, rockin' Argentina
Hot like heaters, swift like cheeters

(Let me tell you 'bout a girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Brooklyn, and her shit is always cookin')
See I be flowin' yes constantly
That's why the cabbage that I stack is deep winter green
And the way that I be hittin', unlike any other sister, I get into your

Ladies, you know that if you don't have a yard man
You can't be a hard man
You know what I'm talking about

And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come
So if a boy want to test you, tell him come, come

Yo, yo, yo, uhh, uhh, yo, yo, whoo whoo whoo whoo, yo, uhh, hey!
Sometimes you gotta, catch yo' breath and,
all the time you gotta watch yo' step and,
catch me all on yo' neck, stressin' 'bout ""What you doin' next?""
And I ain't got much left; tolerance wit' the hoop-la
La jodienda no se para nunca, yeah
They give it to you but I,
keep it movin' while I'm runnin' wit' the rap race
But I need a little damn space, to breathe
I gotta just do me; why I always gotta be sexy huh?
Would you mind when you spill it like me?
In a pair of Air Max sweat pants hoodie huh?
Would ya, get off my back, c'mon, let a nigga relax
Cause I'm, all woman now, hear me roar
Right now I'm 'bout to hit the door,
so I can parle', it's my day, 'bout to pick up my girls at the highway
Gotta get away, gotta do it now, gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah

[Chorus: Angie Martinez & La India]
Gotta be free, gotta do me
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta gimmie some time to breathe
Gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah
c'mon ladies come ride wit' me
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta relax your body!
Gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah
I just really need some time to ease my mind and let my spirit gooo!

Gonna fly.. c'mon..
How many women cook and clean, wash the clothes
work a job, come home - mop the floors, watch the soaps
Nah, no time for that, besides, Young And The Restless is kinda wack
Plus that's that time you can be in the gym,
gettin' ya legs tight, gettin' ya head right
Doin' it every night in summer time almost
You want to ass lookin' firm when they come up close
One of single mother types wit' a couple of kids?
Nuttin' come before them, don't give a fuck who it is
You a proud ass woman, never cry for help
Been doin' it for years all by yourself
For cryin' out loud, can ya get your props?
want to pull your hair out cause the shit don't stop and,
ya nigga want to stress, gettin' no rest
Takin' no breaths, it's PMS
want to know when do I get my day
want to pick up my girls at the highway
Gotta get away, gotta do it now, gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah

[Chorus - La India]
Yo necesito un poco de paz.. en mi vida!
Necesito un poco de paz.. en mi vida!
Some times a girl just wants to be free
from what you think of me baby please
get up off my back and give a girl some space

India,"[Chorus:]
Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin
I can't tell where yours begins, I can't tell where mine ends
Brown skin, up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then oh hey

Where are your people from? Maybe Mississippi or an Island
Apparently your skin has been kissed by the sun
You make me want a Hershey's kiss, your licorice

Every time I see your lips, it makes me think of honey-coated chocolate
Your kisses are worth more than gold to me 
I'll be your almond joy, you'll be my sugar daddy

[Chorus:]

Every time you come around, something magnetic pulls me and I can't get out
Disoriented, I can't tell my up from down
All I know is that I want to lay you down

Every time I let you in, abracadabra magic happens as we swim
Higher and higher finally we reach heaven
Come back to earth and then we do it all again
Yeah...

[Chorus:]

Skin so brown, lips so round
Baby how can I be down?
Beautiful mahogany, you make me feel like a queen 
Tell me what's that thing you do that makes me want to get next to you, yeah

Yo te recordaba y pensaba en ti
Ese tiempo que pasamos tan distante
No los quiero recordar

Los momentos más amargos que vivimos
Nuestro siempre los pudo superar

Hija, sólo existe una
Como el sol y la luna
Eres mi vida y mi luz

Madre siempre ten presente
Que te amaré hasta el día de mi muerte
No hay nadie como tú
Como tú, como tú
Como tú, como tú

Madre mía, no hay nadie como tú
Siempre presente
Siempre presente
Estás en mi mente
Estás en mi mente

Madre mía, no hay nadie como tú
Nadie podrá separarnos
Nadie habrá espacio para amarnos
Madre mía, no hay nadie como tú

India,"A veces no pongo a pensar
De lo que un día fue nuestro amor
Un amor tan natural
Con sentimientos y corazón

Dime, dime porque todo ha cambiado
En un momento en un instante
Ya no me amas como antes
Tal parece que ya no quieres saber de mí

Ya no es lo mismo, ya no es lo mismo corazón
Ya no me buscas, ya no me llamas con pasión
De esté romance no queda nada
Ya no vale la pena

Ya no es lo mismo
De que nos vale continuar si no hay calor
Ni tus caricias ni tus besos ya no están
De este romance no queda nada, ya no hay amor

A veces me pongo a llorar
Cuando pienso en ti siento dolor
Nuestro amor tan especial
Ya no existe por tu traición

Dime porque se ha acabado
En un segundo en un momento
Ya no me extrañas como antes
Y pareces que tienes otra junto a ti

Ya no es lo mismo, ya no es lo mismo corazón
Ya no me buscas, ya no me llamas con pasión
De esté romance no queda nada
Ya no vale la pena

Ya no es lo mismo
De que nos vale continuar si no hay calor
Ni tus caricias ni tus besos ya no están
De este romance no queda nada, ya no hay amor

(No es lo mismo, ya no se siente igual)
No se siente igual
(No es lo mismo, ya no se siente igual)
Esto se acabo

(No es lo mismo, ya no se siente igual)
Si no hay corazón
(No es lo mismo, ya no se siente igual)
Ya no me buscas
Ya no me llamas dime que pasó

(No es lo mismo ya no se siente igual)
De este amor no queda nada ya
(No es lo mismo ya no se siente igual)

Por favor negrita, ay dime
Dime, dime porque todo se acabó
Ya no hay sentimientos
Ya no existe la pasión

(No es lo mismo corazón, no es lo mismo)
No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo
(No es lo mismo corazón, no es lo mismo)
No se siente igual

Ya no estamos juntos
Te has ido por el mundo
Usando una razón

Ya no hay nada que decirme
No tienes como herirme
Aquí está mi decisión

Tengo que dejarte ir
Tengo que dejarte ir
Entre la espada y las paredes
Haces conmigo lo que quieres
Pero eso ya se termino
Oh, oh, uh, oh

Te fuiste me dejaste sola
Sola en mi mundo
Donde eras feliz
Te fuiste así lo decidiste
Para que perder el tiempo
No mereces mi perdón

Pero ahora
Sólo me falta olvidarte
Pero siento como odiarte
Es mejor decir adiós

Haces conmigo lo que quieres

Es dejarte ir

Así no podemos convivir
Así no podemos amarnos

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!
Este nivel solamente es alcanzado por aquellas súper-estrellas!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24

Estos cabrones quieren que los dejemos feos
No bromeo y no les tengo miedo a los feos
Soy guerrillero y en la calle como les campeo
Mucha cazaera, mujeres y fumeteo
Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

Que tengo escobas pa' barrer

Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo

Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

La forma en que ella se mueve no es natural

Why ya ninguno de ellos quiere bailar

Ella tiene fuego, tiene un ciclon en las piernas
Ella tiene fuego, es la atraccion de la fiesta
Ella tiene fuego, why todo el mundo pregunta de que esta hecha

Esa mujer parece estar poseida
No hay nadie k la siga por donde va
No se de donde saca tanta energia

¿Cuanto daño te habran hecho?
Se muy bien que es por despecho
Que no confias en mi

Inocente de ti
¿Cuantos no te habran mentido?
¿Cuantos no te habran herido?
Pero yo no soy asi

Yo también fui lastimado
Sé muy bien lo que se siente
Yo también fui inocente
Y me engañaron sin piedad

Para serte mas sincero
A nadie rencor le guardo
Aun con todo y sin embargo
Les perdono una vez mas

Por que
Todo lo pasado
Si no es bueno hay que olvidarlo
Sé muy bien que no es tan facil
Pero que le va uno hacer

Imposible de estar siempre
Dandole tanta importacia
Ya veraz que a la distancia
Todo queda en el ayer

Por la forma en reaccionas
Te comprendo y te respeto
Tu veras que con el tiempo
Yo te voy a demostrar

Que todo lo que te he dicho
De este amor es puro y cierto
Pero nunca me compares
Nunca me compares
Con los demas

into our love for the future
on a night that has ended
I'm going to delay the time
so that I may dream beside you
that our love is eternal

And we'll fly, we'll fly far away

Where no one will obstruct
our thoughts
we'll fly, we'll fly without fear
like doves as free as the wind

And we'll live, we'll live what's ours

And we'll love ourselves
until we are left breathless
we'll dream, we'll dream awake

In a world without reasons
without colors, nor laments

Without anyone who'll be opposed to
you and I loving each other

From a high mountain
as high as the stars
I'm going to shout that I love you
so that the whole world will know
that we are made for one another
and we'll never leave each other
and even if no one understands us
we will stand by our love

We'll dream awake
we'll live what's ours

I'm going to delay the time
and maintain by my side
our love that is sacred

like free doves
like the wind

We'll dream awake
we'll live what's ours

I'm going to should that I love you
so the world will know already
that I love you
without you I despair

India Martínez,"Es que ya lo sabia lo sospechaba desde el primer día
Pero temía que en tus brazos yo me quemaría
Y sabia que de pronto todo cambiaría
Y otra vida empezaría

Es que ya lo sabía que robarías mis noches y mis días
Me lo temía que ni queriendo yo te olvidaría
Y sabía que todo empieza y todo se ilumina
Cuando tus ojos me miran

Y cada día que pasa sube la marea y me arrastra
Justo al borde de tu boca donde los sueños trasnocha
Y no me dejes solo que contigo estoy mejor
Quédate un ratito que ya pronto sale el sol
Y recojo los recuerdos y me guardo la ilusión
Despacio sin apuro que traigo el corazón desnudo

Y ya lo sabía que por tus ojos yo me perdería
Y seria lo más hermoso que me pasaría y una vida
Una vida no me bastaría pero quien me lo diría

Es que ya lo sabía que cuidarías al aire que respiras
Me lo temía que ni en sueños me abandonarías
Y sabía que todo empieza y todo se ilumina
Cuando tus ojos me miran

Y cada día que pasa se reduce la distancia
Que separan nuestras bocas y la sangre se alborota
Y no me dejes solo que contigo estoy mejor
Quédate un ratito que ya pronto sale el sol
Y recojo los recuerdos y me guardo la ilusión
Despacio y sin apuro que traigo el corazón desnudo

Y no me dejes solo que sin ti no se que hacer
Quédate a un ladito donde yo te pueda ver
Y que mis manos no se pierdan cuando vaya amanecer
Que mientras yo más te descubro
Más me acerco al paraíso estoy seguro

Y no me dejes solo que contigo estoy mejor
Quédate un ratito que ya pronto sale el sol
Y recojo los recuerdos y me guardo la ilusión
Despacio y sin apuro que traigo el corazón desnudo

Y no me dejes solo que contigo estoy mejor
Quédate un ratito que ya pronto sale el sol

And now it falls into his hands, to protect his mother

Sometimes you'll fly and sometimes you'll fall

To come back to the middle

Needing to protect your self now that is just a part of life

you've got to show that
That you're worthy of my time

Why are you hiding from me
I'd quickly give my freedom
To be held in your captivity

I am ready for love
All of the joy and the pain
And all the time that it takes
Just to stay in your good grace
Lately I've been thinking
Maybe you're not ready for me
Maybe you think I need to learn maturity
They say watch what you ask for
Cause you might receive
But if you ask me tomorrow
I'll say the same thing

I am ready for love
Would you please lend me your ear?
I promise I won't complain
I just need you to acknowledge I am here

If you give me half a chance
I'll prove this to you
I will be patient, kind, faithful and true
To a man who loves music
A man who loves art
Respect's the spirit world
And thinks with his heart

I am ready for love
If you'll take me in your hands
I will learn what you teach
And do the best that I can

I am ready for love

My voice
My Eyes
My soul
My mind

Tell me what is enough
To prove I am ready for love

carry on
Tell the kids about me
when they're old enough to understand
tell them that their daddy was
a good man

remember we
chose a star
And as i stand under it
I can't help but wonder if
You see it where you are
For whatever reason
You don't see the seasons
Change again
Go there with peace of mind
We'll meet on the other side
Cause true Love don't end

But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you'd found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck and all the struggles we went through
How I lost me, and you lost you
What are all these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment and beg for something more?

I've been learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak, and my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined and people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
And the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness 
Are the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms 
And the world they put between us - you know it doesn't keep us warm

I've been trying to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
And all the things I thought I'd figured out, I have to learn again
I'm tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak, and my heart is so shattered
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

Oh, there are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down; you know they hurt your pride
You got to put it all behind you 'cause life goes on
You keep carryin' that anger, it'll eat you up inside

I will live happily ever after and my heart is so shattered
But I know it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter

Small, tryin' to ball, always been black
And my hair, I tried it all I even went flat

Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
And I hit the barber shop real quick
Had 'em give me lil' twist and it drove 'em crazy (crazy)
Then I couldn't get no job
'Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs from the block

You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey

With nothin' to lose, postin' with the wave cap
And the cops wanna harass 'cause I got waves

India.Arie,"See, I can kinda recall a lil' ways back
Small, tryin' to ball, always been black
And my hair, I tried it all I even went flat
Had a lumpy curly top and all that crap, now
Just tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
And I hit the barber shop real quick
Had 'em give me lil' twist and it drove 'em crazy (crazy)
Then I couldn't get no job
'Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs from the block
Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far
All these girls these cribs these cars?
I hate to say it but it seem so flawed
'Cause success didn't come till I cut it all off

Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight, I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen, and I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
February, 2002
I went on and did what I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the woman that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Good hair means curls and waves (no)
Bad hair means you look like a slave (no)
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock like Bob Marley
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey
If it's not what's on your head, it's what's underneath, and say

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Who cares if you don't like that?
With nothin' to lose, postin' with the wave cap
And the cops wanna harass 'cause I got waves
Ain't see nothin' like that in all my days
Man, you gotta change all these feelings
Steady judging one another by their appearance
Yes, India, I feel ya, girl
Now go ahead, talk to the rest of the world 'cause

(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I am expressing my creativity

Took away her crownin' glory
She promised God if she was to survive
She would enjoy every day of her life, oh

Indigo Girls,"""There must be some kinda way out of here""
Oh, said the joker to the thief
I want to tell you now there's just too much confusion
And I can't, no, I can't get no relief

Ah, these businessmen, they all, they drink our wine
And the plowman, well, he dig my earth
And you know that ah none of them along the line
Can show me what any of this is worth
You know we wanted to see it now, didn't we? Didn't we?

""There ain't no reason to get excited""
Ah, the thief, you know he kindly spoke
Well, now there are those among us right here, right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke

But you and I, we have been through that
I tell you that this, this is not our fate, no no no
Now, let us all not talk falsely now
You know the hour, well, it's getting late

I said all along the watchtower, the princes, they kept the view
While the women, the women, they came and then they went
Oh, and the barefoot servants too, that's me, that's you
But outside there's a cold distance
Listen for the wildcats, here them growl
Two riders were approaching as the wind began to howl

Oh, there are those among us right here, right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke
All along the watchtower, said, all along this watchtower
Those of you who still have eyes to see, ears hear me

You will be saved by grace in the end
Saved by time if you don't understand
That your hatred is rooted in your fear
And your paranoia and insecurities
Well, they don't belong here

You got to take someones hand
You got to learn to make your stand
And it's a one, two, three, four
Look at the sky, you can open the door
And take my hand, take my hand, take my hand

Ah, don't you want to touch
Don't you want to feel
Don't you know that this is real
I said shelter me, shelter me
Shelter me, shelter me

And save yourself, save yourself
Save, save, save
Save, save, save
Save, save, save
Save, save

And you, and you
And you are a part of the world
You, you, you are a part of the world
You gotta learn to touch, to feel
You know that you are real
I said, learn learn
You are a part of the world

Indigo Girls,"Everybody loves you and they want to know your story
You go riding out a mystery concealed in all your glory
But when it comes to flesh and bones you remind me of Shalot
Only made of shadows even though you're not

With affected conversation trying to pry inside your mind
You are as brilliant as truth and empty as a shell
And I came to you one night and it made me feel like hell

Oh, to reach through all your surface
Just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool
Left me a fool

Antithesis of everything inside theirselves they hate
But you'd better close your eyes when it's time for them to die

And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool

Indigo Girls,"Fare thee well my bright star 
I watched your taillights blaze into nothingness
But you were long gone before I ever got to you
Before you blazed past this address

And now I think of having loved and having lost
But never know what it feels like to never love
Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above

Fare thee well my bright star
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise

Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings
For a cool evening I began to yearn
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire
Waiting to see if I would burn

Fare thee well my bright star
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive

And I caught you then in your moment of glory
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me
My once in a lifetime star of an age

So fare thee well my bright star
Last night the tongues of fire circled me around
And this strange season of pain will come to pass
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down",Fare Thee Well,1994

College farms, hubcaps, and falling rocks
Voices in the woods and the mountaintops

I used to search for reservations and native lands
Before I realized everywhere I stand
There have tribal feet running wild as fire
Some past life sister of my desire

[Chorus]
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now
Steady now and don't come out
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face
Whose turn is it anyway?
Anyway?

Now when I was young my people taught me well
Give back what you take or you'll go to hell
It's not the devil's land, you know it's not that kind
Every devil I meet becomes a friend of mine
Every devil I meet is an angel in disguise

[Chorus]

White, chain, rope, fear
(hush my darling)
Be still my dear

A bullet in the head, now he's dead
A friend of a friend, someone said
He was an activist with a very short life
I think there's a lesson here - he died without a fight

In the war over land where the world began
Prophecies say it's where the world will end
But there's a tremor growing in our backyard
Fear in our heads, fear in our hearts
Prophets in the graveyard

[Chorus]

Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now
Steady now I feel your ghost about
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face
Whose angel are you anyway?

I said there's prophets in the graveyard
(now I walk in beauty)
Prophets in the graveyard
(beauty is before me)
Prophets in the graveyard
(beauty is behind me)

Indigo Girls,"I don't know if it was real or in a dream
Lately waking up I'm not sure where I've been
There was a table set for six and five were there
I stood outside and kept my eyes upon that empty chair
And there was steam on the windows from the kitchen
Laughter like a language I once spoke with ease
But I'm made mute by the virtue of decision
And I choose most of your life goes on without me
Oh the fear I've known
That I might reap the praise of strangers
And end up on my own
All I've sown was a song
But maybe I was wrong

I said to you the one gift which I'd adore
The package of the next 10 years unfolding
But you told me if I had my way I'd be bored
Right then I knew I loved you best born of your scolding
When we last talked we were lying on our backs
Looking at the sky through the ceiling
I used to lie like that alone out on the driveway
Trying to read the Greek upon the stars
The alphabet of feeling
Oh I knew back then
It was a calling that said if joy then pain
The sound of the voice these years later
Is still the same

I am alone in a hotel room tonight
I squeeze the sky out but there's not a star appears
Begin my studies with this paper and this pencil
And I'm working through the grammar of my fears
Oh mercy what I won't give
To have the things that mean the most
Not to mean the things I miss
Unforgiving the choice still is
The language or the kiss",Language or the Kiss,1995

Indigo Girls,"Each time you'd pull down the driveway
I wasn't sure when I would see you again
Yours was a twisted blind sided highway
No matter which road you took then
Oh you set up your place in my thoughts
Moved in and made my thinking crowded
Now we're out in the back with the barking dogs
My heart the red sun
Your heart the moon clouded
I could go crazy on a night like tonight
When summer's beginning to give up her fight
And every thought's a possibility
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen
Why do you spend this time with me
Maybe an equal mystery

So what is love then is it dictated or chosen
(Handed down and made by hand)
Does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years
Or is it just pop emotion
(Handed down and made by hand)
And if it ever was there and it left
Does it mean it was never true
And to exist it must elude
Is that why I think these things of you
I could go crazy on a night like tonight
When summer's beginning to give up her fight
And every thought's a possibility
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen
Why do you spend this time with me
May be an equal mystery

But you like the taste of danger
It shines like sugar on your lips
And you like to stand in the line of fire
Just to show you can shoot straight from you hip
There must be a 1000 things you would die for
I can hardly think of two
But not everything is better spoken aloud
Not when I'm talking to you

Oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight
Breaks a bottle to christen her
Basking in the exploits of her thief
She's a very good listener
Maybe that's all that we need
Is to meet in the middle of impossibility
We're standing at opposite poles
Equal partners in a mystery
(Handed down and made by hand)

We're standing at opposite poles

Indigo Girls,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
Putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace

I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
Gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
And I wish I had a river

I wish I had a river so wide
I would teach my feet to fly

Indigo Girls,"I come to you with strange fire
I make an offering of love
The incense of my soil is burned
By the fire in my blood
I come with a softer answer
To the questions that lie in your path
I want to harbor you from the anger
Find a refuge from the wrath

This is a message
A message of love
Love that moves from the inside out
Love that never grows tired
I come to you with strange fire
Fire

Mercenaries of the shrine
Now who are you to speak for god
With haughty eyes and lying tongues
And hands that shed innocent blood
Now who delivered you the power
To interpret calvary
You gamble away our freedom
To gain your own authority

Find another state of mind
You know it's time we all learned
To grab hold
Strange fire burns
With the motion of love

Fire
Fire

When you learn to love yourself
You will dissolve all the stones that are cast
Now you will learn to burn the icing sky
To melt the waxen mask
I said to have the gift of true release
This is a peace that will take you higher
Oh I come to you with my offering
I bring you strange fire

A message of love

Indigo Girls,"Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough
Me I'm standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
I'm heading out to the east coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

she was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
And we drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
We split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around and looked at me
As I was walking away
Then I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday
On the avenue
Tangled up in blue

I was living in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to new orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Yeah I was working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of de la croix
And all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I'd seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

she was working at a topless bar
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
Now later on as the crowd thinned out
And I was just about to do the same
Yeah but she was standing there at the back of my chair
She said don't I know your name
Well I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
We were tangled up in blue
I know I know I know

she lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
And then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an italian poet
From the 13th century
Every one of his words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue
Yeah yeah

I lived with them on montague street
In a basement down the stairs yeah
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
That's when he started into dealing with slaves yeah
Something inside of her died just died
And she had to sell everything she owned
And she froze up inside
Finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
Oh yeah

now I'm headed back again
I gotta get to her somehow
And all the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
I don't know how they all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me I'm still on the road
Headed for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view

I know I know I know
Yeah yeah oh yeah

Indigo Girls,"Some will strut and some will fret
See this an hour on the stage
Others will not but they'll sweat
In their hopelessness and their rage
We're all the same the men of anger 
And women of the page

They published your diary
And that's how I got to know you
The key to the room of your own and a mind without end
And here's a young girl
On a kind of a telephone line through time
And the voice at the other end comes like a long lost friend
So I know I'm all right
Life will come and life will go
Still I feel it's all right
Cause I just got a letter to my soul
And when my whole life is on the tip of my tongue
Empty pages for the no longer young
The apathy of time laughs in my face
You say ""each life has its place""

The hatches were battened
The thunderclouds rolled and the critics stormed
The battle surrounded the white flag of your youth
If you need to know that you weathered the storm
Of cruel mortality
A hundred years later I'm sitting here living proof
So you know you're all right
(All right)
Life will come and life will go
(Life will come and go)
Still you'll feel it's all right
(All right)
Someone'll get a letter to your soul
(Someone gets your soul)
When your whole life is on the tip of your tongue
Empty pages for the no longer young
The apathy of time laughed in your face
Did you hear me say ""each life has its place""

The place where you hold me
Dark in a pocket of truth
The moon had swallowed the sun and the light of the earth
And so it was for you
When the river eclipsed your life
And sent your soul like a message in a bottle to me
And it was my rebirth
So we know we're all right
(All right)
Though life will come and life will go
(Though life will come and life will go)
Still you'll feel it's all right

I'm coming home with a burning hope turning all my blues to black.

Indigo Girls,"Clearing webs from the hovel
A blistered hand on the handle of a shovel
I've been digging too deep, I always do

Standing on the edge of a drowning blue

I look behind my ears for the green

Indigo Girls,"They said some men would be warriors
Some men would be kings
Some men would be owners of land
And other man-made things
False love as the eternal flame
Would move some to think in rings
And gold would be our power 
And other foolish things
And you who dream of liberty 
Must not yourselves be fooled
Before you get to plea for freedom
You've agreed to being ruled
If the body stays a shackle
Then the mind remains a chain
And that will link you to your destiny

It won't take too long at all

One is knowing and two are scared
They say time is in the river

And drinks his bitter tears

It don't take too long at all
No it don't take long

I don't know what you're talking about
And I say 
You mean to tell me that's all
And I stand before you now
I am hopeful in my rage
You know love has finally called for me
I will not wilt upon its stage
But you know still smaller than my nightmare
Now do I print upon the page 
And do we have to live inside its walls 
To identify the cage
'cause it takes so long
Why does it take so long
And it takes so long
You may say
I don't really care what you're talking about
I'm gonna ask you
You trying to tell me you don't belong
I am my mother's daughter
But I have seen myself in you
It's this blessing that I follow now
And so I must speak true
I dreamed of thousands dying
It was you and you and you
And while the city sleeps so quietly
There is something we must do
And it won't' take long
It won't take too long at all
It won't take long 
May say
I don't know if I want to know what you're getting at
It makes me want to say 
So long
Grief shall come in measures
Only grief alone will know
And you'll see it on your family
And on your own face it will grow
Then they'll try to keep you hungry
And they'll tell you to eat snow
You know pride can be a moving thing
If we learn the strength of no
And it won't take long
It won't take too long at all
No it won't take long 
You may say
I don't think this has anything to do with me
Did you ever think you could be wrong
At noon on one day coming
Human strength will fill the streets
Of every city on our planet
Hear the sound of angry feet
With business freezed up in the harbour
The kings will pull upon their hair
And the banks will shudder to a halt
And the artists will be there
'cause it won't take long
It won't take too long at all
No it won't take long 
And you may say
I don't think I can be a part of that
And it makes me want to say
Don't you want to see yourself that strong
Division between the peoples
Will disappear that honoured day
And though oceans lie between us
Lifted candles light the way
Half will join their hands by moonlight
The rest under the rising sun
As underneath the sun and moon
A ritualed wailing has begun
And it won't take long
It won't take too long at all
And it won't take long 
And you may say
I don't know how to be a part of what you're talking about
And it makes me want to say 
Come on
Come on
Oh beware you sagging diplomats
For you will not hear one gun
And though our homes be torn and ransacked 
We will not be undone
For as we let ourselves be bought
We're gonna let ourselves be free
And if you think we stand alone
Take a look around and you will see
We are children in the rafters
We are babies in the park
We are lovers at the movies
We are candles in the dark
We are changes in the weather
We are snowflakes in July
We are women grown together
We are men who easily cry
We are words no quickly spoken
We're the deeper side of try
We are dreamers in the making
We are not afraid of why",It Won't Take Long,1995

And I've misplaced my cues
And there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on,
And I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from

The big bang and the bigger joke
You seem to know all of them
And injustice makes you red with choke

One thing I could give you,

It since at least 1985. A live version of it appears on the

Festival '90"" CD.
Many is the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused.
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right
I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
So far away from home - so far away from home.
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to it's knees
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right
We've lived so well, so long
Still, when I think of the road we're travelling on
I wonder what's gone wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong.
And I dreamed I was dying
Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was dying.
Oh, we come on a ship they called the Mayflower
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come in the age's most uncertain hour
And sing an American tune
Oh, oh, but it's all right - it's all right, it's all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest
That's all I'm trying - to get some rest

Indigo Girls,"Laughing in a crown of jewels,
Numbness from a sceptors wound.
Toss and Turn, I spin and learn,
""Catch yourself before you burn.""
A joker's dance before the king,
Jangling beads, a silver ring.
Close your eyes and bare the sound,
Jumping up, falling down.

Falling, falling, falling, falling down.
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.

Royal rebels discover you.
Trust? you turn there is no truth.
And circle, circle, why are you scared?
Why a smile instead of tears?
I'm gulping smoke to fade away.
Figures floating down to lay.
Meet the joker and the thief,
The king and queen but, no relief.

Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.

""the king is in the        Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.
Counting house,          Look yourself in the eye before you drown.
Counting out his
Money""

Her parlour, eating      Look yourself in the eye before you drown.

Your actions will follow you full circle round,

Indigo Girls,"She won't recover from her losses,
She's not chosen this path, but she watches who it crosses
Maybe move to the right, maybe move to the left
So we can all see her pain she wears like a banner on her chest
And we all say it's sad, and we think it's a shame
And she's called to our attention, but we do not call her name,
The girl with the weight of the world in her hands.

We're busy with our happiness, busy with our plans
I wonder if alone she wants it taken from her hands
But if things didn't get any harder
She might miss her sacred chance to go a consecrated martyr,
The girl with the weight of the world in her hands.

I wonder which saint that lives inside a bead
will grant her consolation when she counts upon her need
It makes us all angry though we feign to care
But who will be the scale to weigh the cross she has to bear,
The girl with the weight of the world in her hands.

""Is the glass half-full or empty?"" I ask her as I fill it
She said it doesn't really matter, pretty soon you're bound to spill it.
With the half logic language of the sermon she delivers
And the way she smiles so knowingly at me gives me the shivers
I pull the blanket higher when I'm finally safe at home
And she'll take a hundred with her, but she always sleeps alone,

I don't usually talk to you,
But my baby's gonna leave me and there's something you must do.
And I am not your faithful servant;
I hang around sometimes with a bunch of your black sheep,
But if you make my baby stay I'll make it up to you;
And that's a promise I will keep.

Hey Jesus, it's me.
I'm the one that talked to you yesterday.
I asked you please, please, for a favor.
But my baby's gone away,
Went away, anyway,
And I don't really think it's fair.
You got the power to make us all believe in you,
And when we call you in our despair
You don't come through.

Hey Jesus, it's me.  I'm sorry,
I don't remember all I said;
I had a few, no, too many,
And they went straight to my head,
And made me feel like I could argue with God.
But you know it's easy for you, you got friends all over the world,
You had the whole world waiting for your birth,
But now I ain't got nobody.
I don't know what my life's worth,
'Cause when I die and I get up to your doors
I don't even know if you're going to let me in the place.
How come I gotta die to get a chance to talk with you,
Face to face",Hey Jesus,1998
Indigo Girls,"I went all the way to Paris to forget your face
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed
Statues of lovers every place
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory
Smashed by the bombs from above

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil
There's just no medium for life
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral the living God called
And I prayed for my life here in earth

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon
Bleeding its light like a lamb
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me the time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keep.

I would tattoo me
With lines crossing into a hand

Indigo Girls,"During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek
To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

There I am in younger days, star gazing
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass, faith in love's perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one along the road of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bend
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away, eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me
I'd still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift that we could give
Tell all the friends who think they're so together
That these are ghosts and mirages, all these thoughts of fairer weather
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery",Love's Recovery,1998
Indigo Girls,"I'm in search of greener pastures
Don't like my garden's what I said
Although I'm working harder than last year
I'm still deep in the red
I am rowing as hard as I can
And they're selling me up a stream
I'm always one more step away
From the american dream

I got a chip on my shoulder
About the size of a mental block
I've got someone on the telephone
Trying to sell me a future in stock
Maybe I work too hard to be happy
And I should practice letting go
But it's hard not to rock the boat
When you're sailing against the undertow

[Chorus]
I want to slide into the black
And wear the black mask
I might not get what I lack
But it doesn't hurt to ask
If I want to sail
I need my life to be breezier
I said please god or someone
Make it easier

I went to Sunday school every Sunday
Swallowed the bait and I got the hook
When I needed something someday
I would read the good book
Tell me what does it take to get ahead
Sometimes I know I'd sell my soul
When it looks like everybody else is flying
And I'm crawling in the hole

Well maybe if I open my own business
Maybe if I buy a lottery ticket
Someone tell me what is the secret
To getting out of the thicket
Give me more than just a sample
I need a whole lot of glory
My life become an example
Of the american success story

Light the bayou with our taillights in the night
Eight hundread miles to El Paso from the state line
And we never have the money for the flight

Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans
I'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black

Where the waters flow with confidence and reason

With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations
And the peach trees stitched across the land

And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers
And the smoke from the chimney meets its maker in the sky
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers.",Southland in the Springtime,1998

Then you sting me like a viper

To bring your heart back to my island
As the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence

To be weakened like Achilles
With you always at my heels

And still came to no conclusion
We started a fight
That ended in silent confusion

And as we sat stuck
You could hear the trash truck
Making its way through the neighborhood

Picking up the thrown out
Different from house to house
We get to decide what we think is no good

We're sculpted from youth
The chipping away makes me weary
And as for the truth
It seems like we just pick a theory

Ah it's the one that justifies
Our daily lives
And backs us with quiver and arrows

To protect openings
Cause when the warring begins
How quickly the wide open narrows

Into the smallness of
Our deconstruction of love
We thought it was changing
But it never was
It's just the same as it ever was

A family of foxes
Came to my yard and dug in
So I looked in a book
To see what this could possibly mean

Yeah cause there's fate in the breeze
Signs in the trees
And possible tragic events


When forces collide
With the damage strewn wide
And holes blasted straight through the fence

I'm OK if I don't see beyond the shore

And the miracle of daybreak doesn't move you anymore

Made by another in another life time

Must have crashed his little airplane

If we wait for the time 'til all souls get it right
Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation in my life time

I offer thanks to those before me
That's all I've got to say
'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime

To let the next life off the hook

I read the names in stone and say a silent prayer
When I get home you're cooking supper on the stove
And the greatest gift of life is to know love

In our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever
From the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons
Shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty
But it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across
With five steps down
And I guess that's how you started
Like a pinprick to my heart
But at this point you rush right through me
And I start to drown

And there's not enough room
In this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost
And time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits
I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret (don't tell a soul)
That gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamed about you (don't tell a soul)
Last night make me blush
And you kiss me like a lover
Then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river
Play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness
How this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers
Of your fire willingly
And dance the edge of sanity
I've never been this close
In love with your ghost, ooh

Ooh
Unknowing captor
You never know how much you
Pierce my spirit
But I can't touch you
Can you hear it
A cry to be free
Oh I'm forever under lock and key
As you pass through me

Now I see your face before me
I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island
As the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence
And I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles
With you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow
Is the silence that I keep
It poisons me I can't swim free
The river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch
I am no worse than most
In love with your ghost (in love with your ghost)

You are shadowing my dreams

And eat this simple fare
What you need is to feed on something
Warm and hand prepared

The ice at the edges
Waters, change is near
And send you, give in to
And free your long imprisoned tears

Walk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in the sky meet

So sick mad seas made me
Tossed at such a clip
How I clung to you, horizon
The captain of my ship

Your flame never faltered
Even in the fiercest wind
Even the strongest wick grows dim and sick
When it's burning at both ends

Walk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in my sky meet

There is nothing but now
Here's a cloth for your brow
You've done well
But it's time you rest awhile

You've taken on the whole world
Like a boy, like a girl
You're a full grown wonder
You're a child

Speak with ease a cynic tongue
All is simple and loaded
Like buttons come undone

Like dreams and guns and questions
On fire but still alive
Unlock your best potential

Indigo Girls,"When we get back to winthrop
A few miles from the airport
On a plastic chair
On a deck where my friends live
I watch the taking off airplanes
I watch the ocean waves crashing
With all of this movement something's got to give

Down at the hi-tide
Passed down through the family
The fishermen gather to complain about the catch
They talk about time
They talk about tides
The pull of the moon and the coffee deep night black
And I listen to them
And I listen to you
And for everyone there is something never coming back

But for all that we've been through
For all that we've promised
Your wayward direction seems insensible
Words fall off like breathless fish
All flopping and scattered
And hearts picked over deemed dispensible

Down at the hi-tide
We're there for our last meal
The broken loaves are still enough for all
And we talk about time
And we talk about tides
Under the moon with the deep night coffee black
I hear the dim roar of the last flight out
And for someone there is someone never coming back

Indigo Girls,"I wasn't looking to shift my direction 
My eyes straight ahead hands ten and two 
The gravity of our first connection 
Veering off the road and into you 
All the people drive by slowly gawking at the scene 
Of the smoldering inevitable spark and gasoline 

All the way I met you head on full speed 
At the heart the blue flame burns 
All the way I took the crash course impact 
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn 

No amount of playing safe could save me from this day 
The head seeking path of my trajectory 
Didn't we cooly divest of predestination 
Slamming into futures we can't see 
I know what can happen when there's more than meets the eye 
But there's no way to avoid it just get in the car and drive 

All the way I met you head on full speed 
At the heart the blue flame burns 
All the way I took crash course impact 
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn 

It makes me laugh, we?re talking over tea 
When I can still smell the smoke on my sleeve 
Steaming like gun smoke the wreckage of our past 
The scene of a crime I still can't leave 
Oh you and me, we should let well enough be 
But each revisitation points to clues 
There's the oil slick of uncertainty 
And warning signs back there we didn't use 
At least we laugh about it now how we escaped alive 
It's remarkable the mess we make and what we can survive 

(repeat chorus)
",All the Way,2006
Indigo Girls,"You're looking at foreclosure
And doing time,
And it don't sound good this time.
They found the meth and the scales,
And the wife that made your life Hell.

All that time you were telling me
You were fine.
Silly man.

So I got your dog.
How is that?
I made it nice, I wrote a check.
You cut the weeds back on my drive,
'cause you're a good guy,
Deep down inside.

What makes a boy like you go bad?
What makes a man so lonely and sad,
That he's poison all he knows
And in one year, just let it go?

And all that time you were telling me
You were fine,
Silly man, you're a silly boy.

It's been you and me on this frontier
Trying not to be suburban pioneers.
Fightin' off the pavers
And the associations,
And the covenants against the trailers.

I remember how we use to laugh 
At all those rotten men in camo' drag-
With their advantage and their guns,
Up in the deer stand, shooting up a storm.

And all that time
You were telling me all those lies.
Silly man, I'm a silly girl.

You and me-
We used to hibernate like bears
And when we finally came up for air,
Everything's all marked and cleared,
Survey flags flying everywhere.

Once you told me what,
What I'll miss the most
Is just being the only ones-
With our dirt and our dead ends
And no one to turn us in.

Any place in this open mouthed world
Begs to be fed like a bed that beckons you, but you won't rest
Everyone's got a need to go
Most of us stick with our row to hoe
But not you, you're the black crow
With a straight line, and no time
For the birds of prey who wreck your nest
Twice your size steal your best
They set you on this course of your collision

I am a stop along your way
I am the words you'll never say
I crossed the great beyond of fear
I opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view
You went there too

Fly away little bird
Find the song in you that no one's heard
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight
Through this short life
Everyone's got a deep regret
We try to ground ourselves to forget
But your race to the end is neck and neck
You love them, you love them not
The birds of prey who wreck your nest,
Twice your size steal your best
They set you on this course of your collision

I am a stop along your way
I am the words you'll never say
I crossed the great beyond of fear
Opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view
And you went there too

But all along your chosen path are
Window panes and sheets of glass
That you won't see
You fly too fast
One day it will be over

Was the one that I wrote you in my heart
That never made it to the world

Indigo Girls,"When we tried to rework all of this
Each to her rendition
Painted ourselves in a corner
Lost for ideas blindly fishing
For a compliment or kindness
Just to bring us into view
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you

I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds
I tried to make out some connection 
We were at a loss for words
After all that we've been through
I could not see giving up
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
And I believe in you and I believe in love

So we went rolling on down through the years
Taking time off we could steal
Until the thief of things unreconciled
Stuck it's stick into the wheel
Now we're tumbling in a freefall
No one's gonna go unscathed
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
I believe in you and I believe in love

There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands
So just let it go and see where it lands

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
I believe in you and I believe in love

Look at us getting loose 
She leans back against the wall and she watches, tugging her collar like it might be a noose. 

And everyone's tied to their thing 
To their past or their drink or the date that they bring 
I just get tired all of sudden taking it in. 

And I want to lay my head down on you 

Because you're the only solid thing in this room 

A room full of changes, strangers, illusion, confusion, 
I speak from my heart but I'm not really sure if it's true. 
I wanna lay my head down on you. 

Oh they say don't waste too much time planning 
Or you'll get rug ripped out 
And the only way you?ll be satisfied 
Is learning to live without. 
But some plan for the kingdom of heaven 
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven

And I wanna lay my head down on you 
Because you're the only solid thing in this room 

A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers 
If I don?t get out I'll do something I don?t wanna do. 

And I wanna lay my head down on you. 

Was it so long ago 
That we sat and talked in your car 
Your things were all packed 
And the place you were headed not really that far 
Years later I think 
That I would have been much more alive 
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive 

Oh well everything that?s come before us leads us to where we are now
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling 
That I'm lost somehow 
I'm just a ghost looking in 
Out of my own life just visiting 
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep. 

I wanna lay my head down on you 
Because you're the only solid thing in this room 
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache 
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view 

And I wanna lay my head down on you.

The question that says everything.

But where did it come from in the first place?

Cause it'll never leave you alone.

You see possibilities and you're glistening
Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em
When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman

I dream like a mad one
Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can
I'm a psychic and a laywoman
I see love and I like to make it happen
What we get from your war walk
The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock
I want the pendulum to swing again
So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind

It doesn't come by the bullwhip
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips
It's not the company of gunslingers
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger
She is she is she is

It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit
Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate it
Too hard just to go by a blind faith
But they left out the sisters
I've been praying to a father god so long I really missed her
The goddess of benevolence
You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left

Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress
Relegated by the Vatican
But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again

If we're a drop in the bucket
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it
Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right

Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you about hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you about hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you about hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you about hard work
Hard work, hard work, you don't know nothing about hard work
Hard work, hard work

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?

Indigo Girls,"I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' 'bout my life.
Maybe give me insight between black and white.
And the best thing you've ever done for me
is to help me take my life less seriously.
It's only life after all.

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable,
and lightness has a call that's hard to hear.
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket.
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it.
I'm crawling on your shores.

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
There's more than one answer to these questions
pointing me in a crooked line.
And the less I seek my source for some definitive,
the closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine.

I went to see the Doctor of Philosophy
with a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee.
He never did marry  or see a B-Grade movie.
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me.
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind,
got my paper and I was free.

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
There's more than one answer to these questions
pointing me in a crooked line.
And the less I seek my source for some definitive,
the closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine.

I stopped by the bar at three A.M.
to seek solace in a bottle, or possibly a friend.
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board,
twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before.
And I went in seeking clarity.

I woke up with a headache like my head against a board,

And I went in seeking clarity.

We go to the Bible, we go through the work out.
We read up on revival, we stand up for the lookout.

Kids had the mornin' news show on
Bryant Gumbel was talkin' 'bout the fighting in Lebanon
Some senator was squawkin' 'bout the bad economy
It's gonna get worse you see, we need a change in policy

There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad story's one more than I can stand
Just once how I'd like to see the headline say
""Not much to print today, can't find nothin' bad to say"", because


Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'ed, nobody burned a single buildin' down
Nobody fired a shot in anger, nobody had to die in vain
We sure could use a little good news today

I'll come home this evenin'
I'll bet that the news will be the same
Somebody takes a hostage, somebody steals a plane
How I want to hear the anchor man talk about a county fair
And how we cleaned up the air, how everybody learned to care
Whoa, tell me

Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today
And in the streets of Ireland, all the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA

Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found

There's a man all alone
Telling me his friends are gone
That they've died and flown away
So I told him he was wrong
That you friends are never gone

Someone looked me in the eye

It's that same old cannonball
Coming back for your heart again

I felt a simple thing going past
Was it the day in old Georgia
When you were trying to take a bath?
She sees the Day Lily's Boston sign
And the tears spring to her eyes
You turn the car around and your headed back down that track

She's had a heart attack
But the bottle of Jack sits on the counter like the devil she knows
And he beats her up and she fills her cup
With the ambers of a dying fire glow
See how she looked in her school year book
Her friends signed the margins all around
But would you stay in touch you know I miss you so much
I hope we get out of this town

Every day that you get up and force your cards
Playing your story in fits and starts
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream

And you learn how to breathe and you learn how to grieve your past
You study the masters and their books
Giving in to the barbs and hooks
Till you except it with grace when your true love doesn't last

A Pepsi in his hand, getting off the school bus.

Now its tattooed girls with a past they can't remember,
Who pledged allegiance to a life of bending the curriculum.

Drinking with the older guys, tripping by the lakeside.

Feeling bad for giving it up to the man just to make the scene.
Where were you, back when I had something to prove,
With the switchblade set and the church kids learning my moves?

Pollen dust and Pixie sticks, kissing in the deep end
Of swimming pools before I knew what's in there.

Puts his two poles in the sand

What pleasures the surface can bring
I've lost my best craft
Going foolishly back
To where to Sirens sing

And though I stopped breathing I still believe I should try
Maybe a boat in search of lost treasures will pass by.

Climbed over mountains so high
Through jungles and plains

To the construct of our days through the thinning of the trees.

I owe you an apology too many thanks and that's not all.

My calendar lies crumbled laid to waste.
It's been scrawled on, thumbed through and changed.
Will this be the measure of my days?
Dinners and appointments and deadlines I can't make.
And when I start to see I start to see it making sense for me.
That's just hope springing eternally.

Outside the summer's gone for good.
Dying impatiens stacked up wood.
My friend will get together to cook.
To talk about what happened to take a second look.

The snake will always bite the hand that feeds him.

Don't do it if it hurts inside, 
cause either way you're screwed, eventually you'll find. 
You may as well feel good; you may as well have some pride.

Indigo Girls,"In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him... 
Give my heart.",In The Bleak Midwinter,2010

That a kiss under the mistletoe
Would walk out through the snow

Peace be with me

Please baby please
Please baby please
Just let this love be

Sweet to sleep for awhile
And to see this as a reason
To bow to the seasons
And just give them time

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!

Indigo Girls,"I opened my hands up to see what I've got
My days slip like coins into a slot
They are gone 
The shadows lie long

I've been banking on a broken machine
Left unattended like most of my dreams
Rusted components of an unmarked song

We've been staring down a brilliant dream
The sun burns our eyes
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

All around us things come apart
Broken pieces broken hearts
Fix me oil me match me with the next best thing

Person to person nation to nation
Heels dug in no communication
While the time speaks of weathering

We've been wanting to be helped by binding ties
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

And when it breaks down I beg you don't go
A sinking ship I'm ready to blow
I try to outthink you with an army of words
I strategize
I am fighting for the love of my life

Fire and water oxygen
Scotch and soda or any combination
Starts the reaction

Is there no mastermind of modern day
Who can blueprint a plan to make love stay
steady and weatherproof usher in a new revolution?

After trying more the hopeful ones still try
How can we help it
When we're fighting for the love of our live?

Indigo Girls,"I've come a long way
I was a show on ice
Dazzling and brittle
But subject to the sun

And then one day
I went little by little
Back to the water
The place where I'd come from

And I went under
Like stones tied in a sack
And I got emptied
And started my way back

My name
It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

And all my schemes drowned at the seams
Have left me fine in my own skin
I've come a long way
Just to begin

I've come a long way
Under the cover of darkness
Trusting a stranger
A boatman at the shore

The scourge of hope
The ugly face of danger
The keepers of the keys
Had me down on my knees
In front of the gilded doors

And in a world where every ax was poised to grind
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine

My name
It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

And all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind
I've come a long way

I used to be twisted
When you called it an opiate
A simple way to cope
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes

They start out tight
And then they hurt your tired feet at night
But then they give a little day by day
And then before you know it
You look back and you've come a long way

It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

You call my name
My name
You call my name
My shame
You call my name
My home
Everything I own
You call my name

If it's got my name, it's got your name on it
Everything I own has got your name on it
When I was trying to cross the river
You were at the river getting me across and now
Everything, everything I own
Has got your name on it
Oh everything
I've got your name on it",Come A Long Way,2015
Indigo Girlz,"Dear Mr. President I
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?",Dear Mr. President,2009

J'aurais été voir mon grand-père une dernière fois
Dire que je m'occupe de sa fille, qu'il ne s'inquiète pas
Je serais parti voir Martin Luther King
Après son discours, lui montrer la photo de Barack Obama
J'aurais été au temple d'Harlem
Pousser Malcolm de la scène avant qu'une balle l'atteigne
J'aurais été dans la cellule de Mandela
Pour lui dire 'tiens l'coup,
Tes idées seront président du Sud-Africa
Amoureux de lady Diana,
J'aurais créé un gigantesque bouchon sous le pont de l'Alma

Pour déclencher à 7h une alerte à la bombe dans les 2 tours
J'aurais été en Irak
Apprendre aux journalistes à mieux viser avec leur chaussure
J'aurais été en Afghanistan
Jeter les caméras de la dernière interview du commandant Massoud
J'aurais été en Angola

Débrancher le transpo d'EDF avant que Zyed et Bouna arrivent

En mode oriental, palace, Dubai, Marrakech
Bugatti, Bentley dans le cortège
Escortés par la pègre bébé, que Dieu nous protège
Fuck mon ex et ses sortilèges
Ai le cur lège 
Les anges nous enveloppent, savoure ce privilège
Prend ce billet de 500 pour essuyer tes larmes
Ta robe tue, elle est aussi blanche que mon arme
Ton mari vient de la rue, le costard taillé par une lame
On l'appelait déjà monsieur, demoiselle devient une dame
T'es plus une gamine
Zappe les clubbeuses de copines
Orgueilleuse, bousillées à la nicotine
Fais-moi confiance, tiens mon code pin
Si tu me réveille pour prier derrière moi, je dirais Amin
Tu veux un enfant de moi, faut que t'en restes digne
Pour les jours où notre mariage aura une sale mine

Je marie tes rêves, miss, marie mes cauchemars
Impose la trêve que je puisse m'évader du corbillard
Avant que les corps remontent à la surface du brouillard
Que je me fasse une bande ou finisse au trou comme la poule noir
Les corbeaux survolent mon passé sans foi ni loi
J'enterre ma vie de garçon dans les profondeurs d'une fille de joie
Une rose rouge pour implorer le pardon si je déçois
Habille-toi de moi, je t'irais mieux que de la soie
Ne me demande pas de faire un choix entre ma mère et toi, yeah 
Ma place au paradis se trouve pas sous tes pieds
Je lâcherai pas ma famille
N'insulte pas mes amis
T'amuse pas à poser le doigt où ça fait mal à ma vie

Ma confiance compte plus que des bisous
Mon honneur entre tes mains vaut plus que tous tes bijoux
Tire moi vers le haut, je te le rendrais me amor
Ai plus de valeur que l'or
Je t'aimerais jusqu'à la mort

Mariée à la street
Mariée à mes principes
Mariées à mes vices 
Mais pas mariées à un sal type
Soit on est hnin, soit on ne l'ai pas
Garde-moi seul confident entre les hauts et les bas
Quand on se dévoile, les vautours s'alimentent
Une alliance ne garanti pas l'entente
Ni la réponse aux attentes
Pas l'ombre d'un doute, si t'ensoleille mon existence
Sacrifie ton physique pour enfanter ma descendance
Accorde-moi cette danse
Sous notre pleine lune de miel
Deux étoiles dans le ciel
Dans mon cur noir, une étincelle
Tu veux un homme ouvert 
A la fois autoritaire
Qui te fais PTDR
Qui te rappelle ton père
Je t'ai déshabillé de son nom pour te vêtir du mien

I am the better man
When I look to leave her
I always stagger back again

Once I built an ivory tower
So I could worship from above
And when I climbed down
To be set free, she took me in again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back again

Once I sought an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her blues back again

There's a big

Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When I go to cross that river
She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her eyes

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun

So I tried to warn her
I'll turn to see her weep
40 days and 40 nights
And it's still coming down on me

There's a big

[Indo G]
Fresh out the whome, 1973
A baby boy, I'm ready for war
Now this just can't be
Wit my daddy
He don't love us, just too young to know
I love you mama, work real hard
It got us out the ghetto
No more dependin' on my mama
See I'm a cra... man
And I got kids of my own
But if I call she there
Somehow, someway
Indo gone shine like diamonds
Imortalize to my rise dodgin' demons and phantoms
Realize your situation, ain't gettin' no better
They building more and more prisons
I wrote my nation a letter
Conversation and hation
I talked to god last night
Like from last saw 6 phantom
And I'ma lie in twilight
Zonin', think I'm gonin'
Maybe bro hoe
Was I talkin' on that level
Crusafix on my door
Race em', rece em', racin'
got my heart pacin'
Listne learn it's my turn
I'd a free mase em'

Chorus x1

[Gangsta Boo]
The late generation 6
Never caught up in clicks
How can you haters
Claim you real
Turn in (??)
But anyway that stories old
Let me kick in the loot
I'm tellin' heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe's
Claimin' platnum LP's
I can't believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin' your cheese
Whatever punk, I'm on my own
Still stackin' g's
I'm young in ages
Only the hair trick, I've been everywhere
I'm takin' flights to NY
Lookin' for somethin' to wear
I don't be carin' what you say
I'm hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin' wine
Wit my 6's behind
Call up Chris
I'm in crystal
What you got for me baby
Me and Paul comin' over
Range Rover we're reelin'
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtn' all I fall

Chorus x1

[Indo G]
Triggas bleed the same blood
We killin' each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin' and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What's your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I'm steady coastin'
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin' shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin' for freedom in my sleep
I'm bout' to lose my mind
But them angels watchin' over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
WOrd is born, they won't capture me
I'm on a mission, I'm wishin'
Up on a star
Workin' on a meal ticket
While I'm eatin' caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin' to get me
But when I die, I'm takin' six of ya'll wit me
Killuminati
I got my soldiers
And I'm ready for war
Check mate, rockafella
Now they jumpin' in the door

Une premiere mission, bombarder la ville

Il n'why aura pas de survivant
Que la fumee...

Trois mauvais garcons
Au gout de l'action
Trois filles dans la lune
Qui dansent sur les dunes

Les filles sur la plage ne font pas attention
Aux premieres sirenes que font tous les avions
Les pilotes en ordre attaquent sans pitie
See'est dans les flammes qu'ils vont tout exploser
De tous cotes...
De tous cotes, see'est la bataille
Pas de quartier...

Les chasseurs mitraillent sur tout ce qui bouge
Les femmes et les enfants laisseront le sable rouge
Et quand les 3 filles ouvriront leurs grands yeux
Il sera trop tard car toute l'ile est en feu

Les trois garcons les oublieront
Et les trois filles...
Et les trois filles why echapperont

Magie noire, Satan mon Amour
Allons voir ce qui passe ce soir
Une petite frayeur dans les griffes de la peur
Avec toi au service do diable
Main dans la main avec le monstre do train

Quand apparut Ramba
Elle m'a tordu les doigts
Assise pres de moi
Attention ca va commencer

See'est effrayant ce qu'il a sur l'ecran
La panique gagne les premiers rangs
Terrifies devant ce qu'ils voient

Tu no sabes que color amor
Tu me tuviste abandonado tu me tenias pisoteado
Ya no puedo estar contigo
Como pretendes que te crea si me atacaste

Por que te tengo que creer? si no me tratas 
Nada bien no se que hacer
Aunque me muera por besar tu piel eh
Por que te tengo que creer? 
Ya tu sonrisa no es igual a la de ayer
Hoy tienes que saber perder saber perder
Hoy llegaste con la cara de una chula malcriada 
Y vestida de mentiras
Me a costado no quererte y me duele tenerte 
Pero tu no hicistes nada

Y tu pretendes te perdone si me has colmado de dolores

Industria del Amor,"El camino que lleva a Belén
Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió
Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su Rey,
Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón
Al Redentor, al Redentor

Yo quisiera poner a tu pies
Algún presente que te agrade Señor,
Más tú ya sabes que soy pobre también,
Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor
(rom pom pom pom, rom pom pom pom)
En tu honor frente al portal tocaré
Con mi tambor

Voy marcando con mi viejo tambor,
Nada hay mejor que yo pueda ofrecer,
Su ronco acento es un canto de amor

Y aún no se nada de ti

Y regalos y tarjetas
Que tal vez recibirás
Pero se que mi presencia

Para esta navidad
Dios bendiga tu camino
Y te de felicidad
Que no sientas la nostalgia
Que aún siento por tu amor
Hasta ayer tu fuiste buena

Que yo te amara así
Con esa fuerza y ese amor
Que nada mas por ti sintió
Mi pobre corazón

Si lo hubiera sabido
Que un día me ibas a dejar
En el olvido
Jamas me hubiera persuadido

If you want to know what's shaking
But don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm wrong, but I want to believe in humanity

I know it's often true - sad to say
We have been unkind to one another
Tell me how many times has the golden rule
Been applied by man to his brother
I believe if I realll looked at what's going on
I would lose faith I never could recover
So don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm wrong, but I want to believe in humanity.

Alembrando daqueles tempos
Que não mais há de voltar

Numa festa do Divino

Mas antes não tivesse ido

I gotta keep it real... for my peeps, it's my destiny

I gotta squeeze the steel.. in the streets, you won't get the best of me
Uh-huh, I ain't never gonna stop... never

[Letha Face]
Yo, why this life have to be like this? I hang with the righteous
And bang with a tight fist gripped on the handle
Samples of my product, got fiends lurkin' the block
For them teens murkin' them cops, for death penalties at stake
Shakes scrapped off of porcelein plate, to the last grain
Never make the mistake of givin' my last name
To a woman who blames me for all the problems in her life
I play the wheel of fortune, spinnin' revolvers on my life
My life, is similar to a shooting range, but I'm aimed the target
And everybody's takin' shots at me
I pull up fab', but you was love, but I'm not happy
Ask me what motivates me, I'll tell you my baby son
Now it's back to the slums, where about 80 tons of bricks
Creative a building where I stack my chips
Flip, eject and keep squeezing, to the heat recordings
You disrespected, now you fertiziled trees deep in the soil

[Chorus]

[INF-Black]
Still in the same struggle, many pieces'll make a bundle
Like a jungle, make me wonder sometimes, still gotta hustle
On my grind, seen some furious eyes, some went blind
In the midst of the sunlight, it's like I'm stuck in the times
Hope for better days, gotta get mines, get out this cage
Full of rage on my life, now I express it on stage
Relieve the tension over mics, in the whole first page
My deepest feelings hide inside but always show over my face
A young youth behind the cage, now I'm growin' a fast pace
As I notice, and unfolded the years start to age
Reality'll hit you like a hand held grenade
Give me thanks to my earth, she knew when she made official
Birth of her first son, young gun, .38 special
For my daughter, now, I gotta think before I use the pistol
Wait in temple with today's plan, for tomorrow's issues
Wanna see me in the can? I'm too righteous in the mental

You're never gonna make it in this rap game
My baby mamma cries out, as I'm jiving in the crack came
Swimmin' in fat chains, strapped with the dame
Backstrokin' to the blames of corruption
I'm sucked in the whirlpool of gus bustin' and drug hustlin'
Not for nothin', I need a lifeguard to save me from drowin'
I'm down for men, murderers, who murder murderers
And serve customers with that all night service
Purchase burners at retail, I'm tryin' balance the scale
The streets say the prayers, ya'll be conquered by the prodigal
Got it in hennessey, got my brains in a frenzy
Is sellin' cocaine my destiny, or the best of me?
Secret recipe for my music, I create thunder that shatters
The frame, on your H2 Hummer
I'm a bloodhound at heart, it's in my blood, I live it up
If I could trade this crime life for the music, I'll give it up, what

So whenever my dogs call me, I'll be there, the end of story
Surrenders gory, close the book after the final chapter
Gradual bullets that travel faster than yacht masters
Hot ratchets that'll spin you, like a spinning top backwards
Cut your cabbage and turn it into coleslaw
I'm so raw, that my mom should of middle named me Diesel
These lethal bars perfected, can't be injected by needles
Breeding eagles out of Park Hill's hell hole

The impact will crack an elephant's skull

I'm the concrete, the gates, the bars, gunnin' my goof
I'm the drugs, the money, the booze, and every rules
Fuckin' Betty who? Niggaz is petty, can get it to
Watch your mouth nigga, watch me, watch you
Like a movie, thought it was cool, how you wanted to do me
See me live with the snakes and get rid of them rats
I'm the fire in the lake, I burn faster than a match
But longer in a forest, at the speed of a mach
Spittin' out, bangin' off ground, I'm tearin' it down
There's never no fear in me, and they tellin' what's in me now
I've done tasted the dust, washed my face with the mud
Off with these clowns, my shoes is only made from my blood

You know how many chinks and jews 

Drag's done dragged out, on a cash route? 

'cause when I walk in, stop the talking 

I don't give a fuck if its a nigga with a walkman

With a truck full of birds feedin them bread
And before why'all bet just noticed that (uh-huh)
I treat dice games like football;
I pop niggaz and don't give 'em a quarter back
And then I'm spendin that in the store where the linen at
Same night in the club where the Cris' and the women at
why'know, twenty-three with a hell of a flow
Six with no steering wheel, I just tell it where to go, uh
""Stop, make a right at the bar"" - to all the C.E.O.'s it's ten o'clock
Do you know where your artists are?
Dee, I'm in the club smellin like Cristal cologne
Dial Star-8-2 before you call my phone

Real bouncy, hood shit, double are, shit, nigga
The best of the best street team
You know what it is or how it is

Motherfuckers want to act now
Keep toast by the waist now
Got a block full of crack now
Still got to hold the hood down

Little chickens want to run around dig dig down
Got a clip for the full pound
That will put your ass under the ground
With a thunderous sound

Send heat through your goose down
Then I'm blow cool day
All over your body
Ride or die with me today

And when I cook that shook that
Ran a roll back
In an all black
360 doing 160

She want to know what my stamina be
Told the chick real gangstas hard to please
Stash hard in the Honda seats

You got to know how the game will freeze
Especially when you pimp the heat
You got to pop that thing
Put an ass to sleep
Better cock that thing 'cause the walls will creep

All my niggas own real estate
My money can't estimate
On the roll you can't tell the time or the day, and date

Have your bitch in the back of the Escalade
We can make things escalate
Pull out, make his man run on him and he had a gun on him
Busted you then make the right

To cut through the gas station and take the light
Can't tell me Ruff Ryders don't make it tight
Got to wonder what a Harlem, niggas life is like
And I transport keys if the price is right

Then ride back through your hood on a mountain bike
Got bullets that will go through your stomach
Then come out your head
I'm Infrared, you ain't know, I'm about this bread

And I wonder what your family gonna do
When they pronounce you dead
Then come through your hood with Gucci rims on
In the six with the rims on

Look at the hole that you fell in

I might as well slow down

Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive

And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

Her kiss was warm, her touch was tender

In my dreams, she holds me tight

and when the clouds roll in at twilight

I sit and dream of a starry night

Then one day down in Virginia
My blue eyed girl she went away
I miss her love, I miss her Kisses
I'll always mourn that cloudy day

Went in with them stunnas, came out with them cuttas, cut up
You shoulda seen the muthafucka jumpin' thumpin'
Bullet after bullet pumpin' fully after fully
You muthafuckas went in bad choppas
I still got 'em, that nigga begged for his life but I still shot him
I let him know bitch, this is how I feel 'bout ya
I asked him out but now his momma 'bout to hear about him

I'm from the era of the goodfellas, you know
Nigga like Big Ike, Big Nose Bob and Bo Dilly
I growed up on the turf watchin' Murph and them
Murph dropped the top on the bird, that nigga was hurtin' them
I take this shit back to thirties and vogue
Let's see that's way before them Bama-ass hammers and loaves
That's in the days when the ave was jumpin'

Every nigga was gettin' money
Every corner was pumpin' and jumpin'
Huh, but now we in the new era
A new game a different thang and a whole buncha new killas
Money, money, money
Every time, goddammit I'll say it every time
Betta call us murderers

All I need is big guns on the side of me
'Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me
(Hey, hey, hey)

All I need is big guns on the side of me
'Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me
(Hey, hey, hey)

The boy think he gettin' paid, jumpin' out
Squeezin' AK's, on the ground they lay
That's how we do this shit in Dade
Killer bee's, snappin' pictures plottin' killin' me
Them killed my dogg, hell naw it couldn't be
Gotta straighten this shit, got SK's with extra clips
Holla ""killer head"", and make them bitches flip the script

Cut it back to light, fake the left, rip the right
Them feel my eyes, these bitches down to die tonight
Pull right on the side, raise it up squeeze that thang
Went ""bang, bang"" till their muh'fuckin' brains hang
I live for this, so damn right I kill for this
And when I get that feelin', ain't gon' be no hit or miss

All I need is big guns on the side of me
'Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me
(Hey, hey, hey)

",All I Need,2002
InfaRed,"And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs
Keep it real though!",Keep It Real,2003
InfaRed,"[DMX]
Uhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is
Yah mean? We untouchable baby

[Chorus]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

We built this Double are thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggaz round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!

Thorough type niggaz that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out

Come on fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9

Double are and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
What! We untouchable, alright?
Yea, WHAT!

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, YEAH! Be strong..

I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggaz with the weed spots
And all my niggaz on them cell blocks
We goin' are-you-double-F are-why-D-E

You can't fuck with my army
My niggaz is untouchable, eatin' niggaz like Lunchable
.45 be crushin' you when the bullets be touchin' you
Paul bearers'll carry you

To the cemetery where your momma goin' bury you
Black suit be fittin' you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees

Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggaz who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable

[Chorus]

Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane

Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm untouchable, nigga

[Chorus]

Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo

U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double are chain from the side of the car

Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?

Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on

That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
to stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

[Chorus]

[Drag-On]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, come on!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines

I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms

Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh

I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X what up?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we ""Ryde or Die""
You drivin by, we clap at your ride, good-bye

[Chorus]",Untouchable,2003
InfaRed,"We, we are the champions, we can't stop
Cause you just can't keep them
Ruff Ryders down, down, down

By any means necessary, I'mma hold down tradition
White tee, blue jeans, yeah, I fit the description
Know what's richer for the drugs in our waist
We dark so they put the flashlight in our face

Racial profiling send me straight to the island
Hit me with the night stick, the captain start smiling
The foul smell of the ghetto will burn your nose hair
It's forbidden, so no one goes there

The struggle never stops 'til we wake up to spoiled milk
And roaches crawling out our cereal box
They feed us lies, blind our eyes
If you're hand's the same color as mine's, black man rise

To all my hustlers pumping cracks behind the buildings
Ghetto children this is how we living
All my gangsta soldiers in the prison

Ghetto children this is how we living

For the fact that we couldn't take minimum wage
We had stacks in the back of the building
Brothers is crooks but we still read books to the children

Now I keep my mind in the movement
Time in the movement 'cause the ghetto need a lot of improvement
Now we gotta plan for the future and watch for the man
Cause they don't cuff you no more, they just shoot ya

Time for a new beginning, revolution is coming
See the bullets out the Kruger spinning
And we ain't gon' stand down, we gon' stand up

Don't worry it's a totally new beginning

I used to wear bow ties and listen to Farrakhan
Now I'm on the block like the strip is a marathon
The hood ain't been the same since Malcolm and King gone
Tales from the hood is what I sing on a rap song

Everybody petrified ever since 9/11
The hood was under attack before 9/11
Tell me how we got crack and automatic weapons?
My worst nightmare is Bush getting re-elected

The jails is packed, everybody stressed out
Gimme the key and I'm letting all the lifers out
So they could rebuild and work for a dollar bill
Take the shackles off ya mind, we running outta time
