Najwa,"Are you gonna love me back?
How much is long time for you?
Are you gonna love me back?
So capable, so capable
So capable, so capable
So capable

So capable
You're still here

You were preparing something to eat
And you let me know
And you blue fairy, Pinoccio, Pinoccio

Cause they made us too smart
Too quick, too many of us
Cause they made us too smart,
Too quick, too many of us

Are you gonna love me back?
How much is long time for you?
Are you gonna love me back?
How much is long time for you?
So capable
So capable
So capable
So capable
So capable
So capable
You're still here

So for someone of you experience
It has to be'easy to understand
And for someone of you background
It has to be'easy to play around
And for someone of your money
It has to be'easy to pay the round
But your never, you never
You never pay the round

If you pass me by
I just lose my mind
It's so easy for you to be smart
You' re a moron, little idiot
And you've only got a single neuron

You're missing a double click, little idiot
Can't you go a little more quick?
So I'm wasting, I'm wasting
I'm wasting my time with you

Are you gonna love me back?
How much is long time for you?
Are you gonna love me back?
How much is long time for you?

Najwa,"I can't contain my love for you
I wouldn't mind, fighting
For you, for you

I get it now
I get the strength
I'm so ashamed,
Don't you see I'm sorry?
Yes I'm sorry

And now I know
That to get insulted
And fight for love,
Loving that I like it,
Yes, I like it

And when you lie by my side
Your love Keeps us warm inside
Showing us how It's like

A new day comes
And all is true
And nothing's what it seems
Nothing

And no-one doubts
And no-one shuns
The fear for love has gone at last
I like it

Something disappeared
My face is dried with tears
And now you keep on trying
Try, try
And you say why
You say why
You say why
You say why
Then I cry

And you get fine by my side
You're love keeps us warm inside
Now I'm high, high, high

And you get fine by my side
You're love keeps us warm inside
Now I'm high, high, high

And you get fine by my side
You're love keeps us warm inside
Now I'm high, high, high

And you get fine by my side
You're love keeps us warm inside
Now I'm high, high, high

And you get fine by my side
You're love keeps us warm inside
Now I'm high, high, high

Najwa,"Finding a base
To grow up smart

There's nothing
Like being far away from home to understand
How it's like

Even the phone calls didn't work
Future plans, success and glory?

Blows your mind,
Blows your mind

Strange days have found us
We have to let them go
Next time, next time we're here

Ready, ready, ready
For so long ready

So I feel like a walk,
That's when I walk
So I sleep not,
But I continue dreaming,
Dreamy dreaming

So I'll wait for the desert
And I'll wait for us,
Yes I'll wait for us
Future and past

And I'll wait for the tide
And I'll wait for us
Yes, I'll wait for us
Future and past

Listen, listen...

I'll wait for the desert
I'll wait for us
I swear to God I'll wait for us

When you realize
I'll wait for the summer day
I'll wait for the tide to stay
I'm waiting for glory
Not much of the story

Drop in my eyes
Drop in my eyes
Drop in my eyes
Drop in my eyes

So I fell like a walk,
That's when I walk
And I sleep not
But I continue
I continue, I continue
I continue...

So I fell like a walk,
That's when I walk
And I sleep not
But I continue
I continue, I continue
I continue...

Najwa,"I felt inside electrified
What gives the shine is our light
We're blowing up missiles in the air

Like being in love
It's speed of light
Intangibility
I see the possibility
Say hello life
When dancers wave their hands in the air

Fasten your seat-belt again
Fasten your seat-belt again
I read into your dirty face
Just in case, just in case

Fasten your seat-belt again
Fasten your seat-belt again
I read into your dirty face
Just in case (Just in case)
Just in case (Just in case)

We are metal squads
Melting love with fuel
Here comes the death
But just after this song
Cheap hamburgers, bank offerings
Dirty nuclear stuff
Say hello life
Dancers wave their hands in the air
When dancers wave their hands in the air

Fasten your seat-belt again
Fasten your seat-belt again
I read into your dirty face

Najwa,"(sexy, sexy)

Under the blankets my body
Like when I was fifteen
Today I need something new

My skin has become my enemy
In a genuine way
Today is the day

Emerge from my bedroom to the real life
From the coffee the sugar high
You know it's saccharin time

Emerge from my bedroom to the real life
From the coffee the sugar high
You know it's saccharin time

I want to feel a sexy light
I want to feel a sexy light
I want to feel a sexy light
I want to feel a sexy light
I see you like a priviliged vision
And you are starting at me
Do you feel what I feel?

In this public space a private moment
I need some desperate love
In a primitive way

Emerge from my bedroom to the real life
From the coffee the sugar high
You know it's saccharin time

I know that's what I'm feeling
(I know you got the feeling)
I know that's what I'm feeling
(I know you got the feeling)
I know that's what I'm feeling

I want to feel a sexy light
In my chest, in my life

I remember the way you used to betray
And sometimes I pray for the errors I made
And you're goddess
You are my God

When he ran from you
In a private detective overcoat
And dirty dead man's shoes

The pretty things of Knightsbridge
Lying for a minister of state
Heard a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at Traitor's Gate

Oh, the high heel he used to be
Has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps
As they follow him around

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

There's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

For his private wife and his kids somewhere
Real life becomes a rumor
Say his up Dutch courage, just three French letters
And a German sense of humor

He's got a mind like a sewer
And a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted
And he pays for the privilege

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?
A man out of time

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire short and sharp
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought

Somebody's creeping in the kitchen
There's a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
Who's up late polishing the blade

Love is always scarpering
Or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive
And hate yourself in the morning

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to O's
O's to pounds I'm just holding it down

[Chorus: x2]

I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender
Have it rock hard plus white as December
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days
So if I get jam I know where it came from
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine
Some money come with blood and some money come with time
Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe
Money in the wrong way I'll lead you to the wrong place

[Chorus: x2]

I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row
And I wouldn't give a fuck if you nod or stay woke
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint
Back in Memphis Tenn with drank
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count
I'm a hustla' don't make me say it again
I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying
I'm congruent to them boys I'm out there slanging them pies
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed

Look here, you know what I mean, I done did a lot of
shit in my life, Yo Gotti, street raised street paid...

[chorus]
I'ma sell my dope can't trust no bitch
Pop my wheel break bread with my click
If a nigga don't hustle than a nigga don't eat
steady chasin paper out here running these streets
I'ma sell my dope can't trust no bitch
Pop my wheel break bread with my click
Kinfolks we block burn till we get these mills
We do it how it go so we gone get it how we live

I'm back to the basics
Face it I'm back on the rise
Back with my guys
Back 22 for them pies
I'm back rollin' clean
Back lookin' mean at niggaz
That's throwin' up signs
Lettin' off rounds for mine
Back in the hood
Like my niggaz think I should
But knockin' on wood
They got a nigga back on that good
Back on a mission
In other words I'm back in the kitchen
Water whippin' with my niggaz tryin' to sew up the city
Back in school
Gotti back to actin' a fool
But seekin' some knowledge
Southwest community college
Took hold a nigga
Enrolled and showed a nigga
When Gotti around, ain't enough hoes for niggaz
Never did I
Get the big head or lie
And say I'm the mayne
I just said I'm workin' with change
And doin my thang
I can't help I don't trust hoes
Move birds on the low and seen a hundred or mo'

[chorus]

You want to sue me? You want to rob me?
Get your choppers come to my shows and try to mob me?
I took birds from your people
So you gone kill me
Say my beats be aight
But you don't really feel me
Dog, I ain't hard to find I be in the bay
Ridgecrest, Shady Vista street everyday
Sellin yay with my nigga G.B. and Todd
Lil' Mont Big G we all got heart
Rap shit aight but I'm from the streets
Under all circumstances I gotta eat
I gotta ki
What you know about thirty six o's in a drought
Double up make 'em bounce whoa...Look at my mouth
Blockburner nigga be rollin'
I go the title from (?) my shit ain't stolen
I'm watchin' TV's and DVD's
I'm thug bruh
One more time Dre and Shine
It's love bruh, It's love bruh

[chorus]

Dope just (???) and can't stop me from gettin this paper
Nineteen years a closet full of gators
Platinumed out chain beggets around my charm
One hundred fifty shots shtos four five caliber drum
Got 4 spots
One for the money
One for the drugs
A third spot for all of these hoes that I don't love
A fourth spot for me and my shorty that stayed down
The one who stayed strong and helped me through shady grounds
I'm a mean mugger,head buster
Nothin nice
I'm a street hustler
And my motto is rock ice
Streets is callin
Why not picture me ballin
Enjoy it while I got it cause one day I'm gone be fallin
Dope boys do what they want not what they can
You boys tag along and protect the man
Cheap hoes jockin them niggaz cause they got paper
All hoes change like weather because it's nature

Eu gosto quando fica louca, cada vez eu quero mais

Whisky ou água de coco pra mim tanto faz
Eu já tô cheio de tesão e cada vez eu quero mais

Um, dois, três, quatro
Pra ficar maneiro eu jogo o clima lá no alto

Em cima, em cima, em cima, em cima
Alto em cima, alto em cima, alto em cima, alto em cima,
Em cima, em cima, em cima, em cima

Chego cheio de maldade eu quero ouvir você gemer
Eu te ligo e chega a noite, vou com tudo e vai que vai
Tem sabor de chocolate, sexo que a gente faz
Corpo quente estou suado, vem melar e vem lamber
Só o cheiro, só o toque já me faz enlouquecer
Já me faz enlouquecer

Every time I want more

High, top, top, top
High, top, top, top
On top, up, up, up 
On top, up, up, up

I'll fuck everything, I take firm for real
I arrive full of evil, I wanna hear you moan
I'll call and arrives at night, go with everything and that vai vai

i've been waiting for days to turn into nights for so long
i'll just sit here alone watching the tone turn to blue
maybe i tried, maybe i was looking for you
i got lost in the waves this bottle has taken my mind
hey there my old friends won't you sit a while with me
stay here and drink away time till we all just can't see...no we all can't see 

that the captain is wasted he's been drinking all night
and we're headed out to sea
it's the worst storm we've seen in 15 years and i just can't seem to believe
that she won't be waiting for me
no she won't be waiting for me
so i cry load up the cannons and go get the guns
we'll fight through all that we see
i've got nothing to lose cause she's taken my heart
and she won't be waiting for me
no i just can't seem to believe
that she won't be waiting for me.
",The Captain,2003
Named by Strangers,"half a bottle of jack it hit me accross the back 
I said hey there mister well I feel like this is all wrong 
I asked him once again he just looked at me and grinned 
he said man I don't know where the hell we are 
too many nights at the bar can't find the keys to my car 
this night is growing grim and I just can't wait for the end 

Chorus 
cause we're all lost and gone o but I just wanna to go home 
twice on the highway I heard your song and it made me wanna go home 
cause I've been away too long but I just wanna go home 
Cause I am lost and gone but I, I just wanna go home 

Everything moves too fast I forget to stop and look at the past 
and I think I will try this thing yah I will try it one more time 
Maria sits across the bar sometimes she looks so far 
but I think to myself that I would like to stay a while 
wanting one more song surely it comes along 
She sits back a while just sits and enjoys my smile. 

I can't seem to get away three times we laughed today 
everybody wants to look away, they seem all kinds of scared 
well I fell down again I need a little help from my friends 
well I think that in the end we'll, we're going to be just fine 
we'll have just one more beer and then I swear we'll get out of here 
it's time for us all to go out and get lost",Gone,2003
Named by Strangers,"politics as usual we're giving the dog a bone 
singing everyone's sitting around talking about freedom 
all afraid to be alone. 
everyone's fighting for something but we all want to sit at home 
we've only traveled a short little way 
we've still got a long way to go... 

when we see the light and we watch it flicker 
then we make a box our home 
and when we see pain and we start to snicker 
then we turn into the drone 
buying and selling in a fried fish smell even dinner time's in the 
know 
we've only traveled a short little way, 
we've still got a long way to go....

We all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it faze you no way (no way)

One day (one day), One day (one day)

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence
Down with the hate
One day we´ll all be free
And proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like

There are a few things I haven't told you yet.

Nametag Alexander,"All that I ask is for you to wish me well
But you find it fitting to wish that I fail don't wanna see me excel 
The field - is not leveled, it's tough to find balance that's why I'm tippin’ the scale, But far from a Libra conveniently I'm a leader, 
Learned more from Jay and Jeezy than my teachers 
And they ain’t even get the degree to teach us, 
I'm from the school of King of Rock and My Adidas 
Light above me as I'm executing my brightest ideas, 
This story is of glory, you gotta believe in me 
A victorious champion the Muhammad Ali in me, 
Here I am in the present my gift is of importance 
When I ex-it, bury me a legend who was historic it was destined, 
It's all drawn out by the most high check the sketches 
I-neva failed I've only absorbed lessons, no takin Ls only two Vs-weaved, connected, That's twice the victory let's create history

I didn't climb this high, only for me to fall
I’m puttin’ in that time, because I want it all
So I been grindin my whole life, strivin my whole life 
Workin all day I ain't-slept through a whole night, 
I climbed this high, and I don't plan to fall

Please miss me if you-doin’ the most at doin’ nothin, 
I got little time to waste wit a lot to accomplish, 
Followed my own compass, my own routes it's no hand outs 
The last dragon, Leroy the master I own somethin, 
You doubt I prosper that's yo’ opinion and own assumption, 
And my assumption and opinion is you not a profit, 
Back against the ropes...I was taught how not to get boxed in, 
Roll wit the punches weavin’ and bobbin’ 
Cause life got a way of throwin’ you uppercuts and haymakers 
You try to prevent it wit a block or you gotta take the hit
I entered the game wit- no intention to quit, 
Leadin’ in the far left lane no signal on to switch-you can say that I was sent
You can't prevent what was meant-you either wit me or you in the way- take a pick 
I made a quick decision to wanna be rich in spirit and in wealth,

Es schmeckt uns nicht, doch wir wollen von allem kosten
Bei tausend und einer Möglichkeit unentschlossen
Wir sind Nichts-Verlanger, aber Alles-haben-Woller
Ist das Glas halb leer, dann schütten wir es einfach voller
Und wir teilen uns den Kleiderschrank, teilen unser Essen
Hält man uns die Tür auf, wissen wir es zu schätzen
Schau uns an, wir haben nichts zu verlieren
Aber alles zu gewinnen, wenn wir richtig investieren
Man sagt mit Geld ist nicht immer alles leichter
Doch ich find', wir sollte reich sein

Du bist broke, doch reich an Liebe
Wirst von deinen Träumen angetrieben
Auch wenn es scheint, als könnt' ich fliegen
Im Grunde sind wir gar nicht so verschieden
Wir knicken ein, doch wachsen weiter
Bald steht ein Baum da, wo ein Keim war
Wir alle fallen, bevor wir lernen zu fliegen
Im Grunde sind wir gar nicht so verschieden

Wir sind alle Millionäre
Unendlich reich an dem was wir fühlen
Wir sind alle Milliardäre
Unendlich reich, will nichts mit dir teilen

Du bist broke, doch reich an Liebe

Es ist eine coole Katze in der Stadt
Streunt, wenn alle schlafen, durch die Straßen in der Nacht
Sie springt über Dächer, ungehindert von Verboten
Katzen stürzen nicht, sie landen immer auf den Pfoten
Sie ist launisch und wirkt ignorant
Sie weiß, dass sie schön ist und fühlt sich interessant
Sie ist pleite, aber elegant
Denn sie isst die Reste nur in allerbesten Restaurants
Grüßt jeden Hund und jede Maus
Du wirst lachen, doch ihr kann man nichts vormachen, sie kennt sich eben aus
Das Spiel verstanden, alle Regeln gerafft
Weil sie das schon ganze neun Leben lang macht
Sie hat alles gesehen
Und vielleicht ist sie deshalb 'n kleines bisschen schizophren
Keiner weiß, was sie sich als nächstes überlegt
Deshalb geh dieser Katze lieber aus dem Weg

Nein, sie ist einfach nur zu cool um ihre Krallen auszufahren
Sie hat keine Angst, bleibt entspannt
Und läuft in aller Seelenruhe über Autobahnen
Du hörst die Katze nie fauchen, doch sie bezwingt auch mal 'nen Hund
Sie kann sogar tauchen, sie geht den Dingen auf den Grund
Auf der Straße zuhause, sie kommt viel herum
Egal was für 'ne Strecke, für sie bleibt's 'n Katzensprung
Findet Regeln albern und auch die Tiere aus dem Zoo
Sie hält die Welt doch eh nur für 'n riesen Katzenklo
Keiner weiß, was sie sich als nächstes überlegt

Schlafenszeit, morgen drückt sie wieder die Schulbank
Sagt „Gute Nacht“ und lässt die Tür einen Spalt auf
Betrachtet ihre Mutter mit nem kugelrunden Bauch
Sie wirkt ständig müde, packt Überstunden drauf
Verzichtet auf sich, gibt ihrer Kleinen was sie brauch
Sie ist eine starke Frau und weint nur ganz heimlich
Allein, wenn Sie weiß, dass keiner schaut
Plötzlich klingelt's es an der Tür, er is' wieder da

Die Kleine hört wie jedesmal, was er mit ihrer Mutter macht
Ein komplett anderer Mensch wenn er getrunken hat

Sie darauf acht gibt, leise zu atmen
Damit er nicht hört, dass sie noch wach ist

Griff in den Mandarinenkarton und schnell weg von hier
Den Touri am Eck fixiert
Ungefragt den Dreck von seinen Schuhen poliert
Nur für vier Dirham

Unterdrückt den Schmerz, um nicht zu schreien
Er hinkt weiter, um nicht gekriegt zu werden
Und er duckt sich
Die Polizei kommt, er nimmt ältere Leute als Schutzschild
Bis er umkippt, Schlag eins, Schlag zwei

Und mein Vater von Privatdetektiven gejagt
Später erfahren wir, dass er vor Jahren abgeschoben wurde
Sitzt die Haftstrafe ab in 'nem Knast bei Nador
Wird entlassen mit der Diagnose Krebs
Kommt auf die Idee, seine Familie wiederzusehen
Fordert uns zurück, so als wären wir sein Besitz
Nicht mal das macht er selbst, nur sein Schwager wird geschickt
Droht damit, mich zu kidnappen, falls er mich sieht
Seit diesem Tag durft' ich nie wieder alleine draußen spielen

It's not that you don't care
There'll always be someone who's there to take

Who cares if you're cheating

As life keeps repeating
It will always be all about you or me

Namnambulu,"Day by day we have our little problems
Don't think about it


There's no time to look behind
It could be so easy


Take a step aside to see the difference
If you really dare to
The problem that you have's a different kind


Knowing where to go is not so easy
But you have to focus


Taking time to look is sometimes hard
You just have to want to


Looking for the reason why you stay here
It's a change of perspective
Seems like playing with a deck of cards


Misunderstanding - starts shouting
Love and devotion - for sad things
Fear and confusion - is religion
World domination - for nothing


Communication - is ending
All in one nation - an illusion
Negotiation - is worthless
Contamination - in process",Perspective,2004
Namnambulu,"Die Zukunft steht auf einem anderen Blatt
Und keiner weiss wer es beschrieben hat
Wir ahnen nur was dort geschrieben steht
Gewissheit kommt nur wenn die Zeit vergeht

Die Gegenwart ist wo all dies geschieht
Wo künftiges in die Vergangenheit flieht
Die Träume allenfalls zu Grunde geh'n
Um uns zu zeigen wo wir wirklich steh'n

Vergangenheit hält uns in ihrem Bann
Obwohl sie keiner mehr verändern kann
Verlust ist einzig was sie uns beschert
Traurigkeit darüber was vergeht

Ganz egal wie wir uns wehren
Die Zeit sie wird auch uns verzehren
Sie fährt uns durch ihr Labyrinth
In dem wir stets verloren sind

Ganz egal wie lang es geht
Keiner wird ihr widersteh'n
Auf Schritt und Tritt verfolgt sie dich
Und irgendwann verschlingt sie dich",Zeit,2004
Nan Bell,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

And stops my mind from wandering

And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

And I still go

And stops my mind from wandering

Daily survival tactics and I pray
Dear lord forgive me and show me the way
To the light and the place called paradise
No matter when or how it I should I'll fight
You better be ready before you come to the ringside
No tears my friend only the strong survive
It always comes hard and direct in my face but my man

But today now I know I can feel it through my body and soul

It made me bad I didn't have the chance to ask dad
Nightmares in my sleep I wake up frightened and scared
Who cares a boy in young years all I wanted was to see the
Light in full gear
Yeah here I come here I am here I slam
Rollin' with the clique with another dope party jam
Look for what you want and finally succeed and believe
Your dream will come true yes indeed

I know I got to pay the price

Thank you for the blessin' and the skills on the mic
Five years we know there's no diggity
Free at last see the light in me
What goes up must come down
I'll be around while you heading towards deathtown
Always look forward hardly never look back
So many tears and the snakes on my jock
Now I'm riding in my big fat ride
Your ass is late so look for the line
Nana in the house to let you know
What I see is how I feel so leave me alone
Lonely (3x)
Knock on my door whom you lookin' for
A dream or reality enemies at my door
Eyes I realize it's fantasize I must be high
So let me live before I die
Once again grab the bottle twist the cap
To survive your life is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step my step and be versatile
Love peace and crash that's what it's all about
Alone by yourself than you lack there's no doubt about
I'm always into something making moves to improve

Nana,"""Away,
Astray but on track to what I think 
Will be the best of times when I'm on my own.
So if I may, I'll say yes, I am the player
Always on the move, I'm strong when I'm all alone.

Some things will change -
I can feel it coming but I don't know what it is.
Feel out of range -
Don't know what to do, but I'll live.

It must be like paradise,
If only someone could tell me how
So please start rolling the dice
'Cause I can feel that my time is now.
It must be like paradise.

Confused, reduced to a life where I'm no longer in control
All in all I got used to be
I'm not afraid, I played all the cards that I was dealt
But this is new, I'll just have to wait and see.

Some things will change -
Don't know what to do, but I'll live.

It must be like paradise,
If only someone could tell me how
So please start rolling the dice
'Cause I can feel that my time is now.
It must be like paradise.

It must be like paradise.",Paradise,2004
Nana,"You have two new messages

?
?

Growing up in the big small world have you thinking you don't need your loss?
All I did was smoke up 
All I did was grow up
Shit, I'm such a grownup

My Uber driver from Pakistan, he says what he has is in enough
All I did was pour up
All I did was grow up
Oh shit, I'm such a grownup

If I shoot for the stars and I don't know how to land, am I lost?
Or an astronaut
If I push my minivan and I betray my macho man, am I lost?
Shit
Sliding doors

We're all on the other side
Screaming you should cross the border
We're all on the other side
Swearing we know Messiah
Ay, ay

All I did was smoke up
All I did was grow up
Shit, I'm such a grownup
All I did was pour up
All I did was grow up
Shit, I'm such a grownup",Grown Up,
Nana,"Refrain:
Oh can you hear him comin'
Is the darkman you better keep runnin'
Always believe in what ever you say or do
That's the point that's why I can't say I love you
I got more than a thousand problems on my mind
I'm commin' from the dark and light's so hard to find
Can't concentrate I steady loose control
The pain in my brain make me wanna explode
Like the fugees day and night searchin' for the score
To bring the vibes I'll be the key to your door
It all started off with a glass of wine
But now I need nine to feel fine before I sign
Somebody help me or else I'M gonna die
Don't be shy ask why before passin' me by
The best things in life is what I heard are free
Michael Jackson will definitely tell you the story
It's the darkman flowin' of the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
I take a look in the mirror I see somethin' wrong
Last year I was strong somebody please blow the horns
Daily survival tactics and I pray
Dear lord forgive me and show me the way
To the light and the place called paradise
No matter when or how it I should I'll fight
You better be ready before you come to the ringside
No tears my friend only the strong survive
It always comes hard and direct in my face but my man
That the deal that the rule of the game that we play
Everyday what can I say
Real brothers don't die 'till they get their peace of the cake
Go for it go get yours stay on the course
Physical force like a rebel no doubt without a pause
Darkman flowin' on the mic
With the flava in your ear to be or not to be
Mama always said son you reep what you sow
But today now I know I can feel it through my body and soul
Separate the good from the bad
You better do your own thing than ending up sad
It made me bad I didn't have the chance to ask dad
Nightmares in my sleep I wake up frightened and scared
Who cares a boy in young years all I wanted was to see the
Light in full gear
Yeah here I come here I am here I slam
Rollin' with the clique with another dope party jam
Look for what you want and finally succeed and believe
Your dream will come true yes indeed
Make a small step forward than a big step back
Any other direction will probably break your neck

I remember the time the time that we had
I remember the things that use to make you mad
And I wish I could turn back the time
And I wish I wouldn't cry every night
I remember the time

Clock always tickin' that's no question
I did you wrong I must confess not my intention
When I mention your name the pain I feel ashamed
If I could I would it's only me that I can blame
My time was on I had to move no substitution
I took the risk although no conclusion
Lack of piece of mind to go the same direction
Time is never personal you win or loose relationships
That's the way how it goes
Deeply hurt from your head to your toes
Slow mo' see you dragging
Down the hole
You should be where you belong in the front row
I cried everyday improved my behavior
You can't see what I see tell me why are you in anger
Forgive your enemies let the lord be your savior
In God I will trust
'Cause I know he will remember

[Chorus: x2]

Join me on a ride what's the clue explanation
Talk about the time you and me let's go fishin'
Brainstorm' I bring the vibes shut your mouth better listen
Fighting everyday still don't know the definition
Time is money and time will tell
Sunshine in heaven or grill in hell
Society makes the pace join the race and obey
One for the money and two the space three hooray
I want to thank g.o.d. the inventor kept at least an eye on me and put me in the Center
I remember 1996 in December
Booya is the name and Nana is a member
I cried everyday re-arranged my behavior
You can't see what I see tell why are you in anger
Forgive your enemies let the lord be your savior
Finally he'll put you through,

Nana,"Chorus:Nobody gets too much heaven no moreIt's much harder to come by, I am waiting in lineNobody gets too much love anymoreIt's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
Bridge:And then my life - have you seen meI am foreverEverything we are will never dieLove is such a beautiful thing
Once upon a time there was a place called earthFounded by the most powerful manMy Lord showing me the way I have to go, to growLet there be woman and a man you knowEat what you want and drink as much as canShare what you got with your other fellow manLive in harmony family freeEverybody has a chanceDespite envy and jealousyNow would you please mind your own bizDaily operation due to life is a bitchWhat's on your mind let me knowAs we roll a thousand problemsMessed up in your headControl the flow of your body your mindWe spoke beforeRunning out of timeOnly the Lord and heaven knowsDecide stand up be manAnd make it tightFight for your rightTill you get there to see the light
Chorus
Who's in charge of the mess that we madeWill be served with a platterOn the first of judgement dayFaces, faces nothing but your facesFaces, I can see your facesLonger than a showlace in caseYour never prayed to God to the G.O.D. the man himselfInventor creator Holy GhostNow ring the bellsCaptured my my soundNext customer my clienteleSee ya later see ya alligatorMake you chill relay like Anita BakerBring it down to the point and make a positive moveSo we can groove till we loose our coolMiracles happen everywhereGuided by the lightI guarantee one will come your wayAdvisable straight from the horses mouthLove, peace - I'm out

Eu danço com você o que você dançar

Se você deixar o sol bater nos seus cabelos verdes
Sol, sereno, ouro e prata
Sai e vem comigo
Sol, semente, madrugada
Eu vivo em qualquer parte do seu coração

Se você deixar o coração bater sem medo

Mesmo que exista outro amor que te faça feliz
Se resta, em sua lembrança, um pouco do muito que eu te quis

Nana Caymmi,"Meu castelo é a casa da fazenda onde teço a minha lenda
Sei, meu príncipe virá
Nesse sonho bom que me alimenta a espera é menos lenta
Se o desejo delirar
Eu prefiro assim pois com essa espera
Domo a fera que há em mim

É imaculada, a semente do prazer rosa ardente, por florescer
A criança deixa o paraíso fadas, córregos, sorrisos
A pureza virginal
Planta no seu seio adolescente a maçã e a serpente
Do pecado original
Quero ser mulher no lugar e hora
Que meu príncipe quiser
E assim conquistada pela espada do querer
Continua a ser imaculada

Nana Hedin,"When everything I do just make
Me feel the same
I need to get away
To somewhere far away
I wonder, why is that
I can't play the game
And find another way
To focus and take aim

Going away to clear my mind
I know I need it when
I have to start again
Going away, I know I'll find
Somewhere I can be myself once again

Whenever I am far up in the air
No one knows where I am
Where I'm going
So far up in the air
Trying to let go
Cause here I know how
To live day by day

I know that this can't be
Nobody's fault but mine
Tried to be everywhere
Like anyone would care
I always thought that everything
Would be just fine
If I just played it fair
But now I crossed the line

Going away to clear my mind
I know I need it when
I have to start again
Going away, I know I'll find
Somewhere I can be myself once again

Astray but on track to what I think 
Will be the best of times when I'm on my own.
So if I may, I'll say yes, I am the player
Always on the move, I'm strong when I'm all alone.

Some things will change -
I can feel it coming but I don't know what it is.
Feel out of range -

If only someone could tell me how
So please start rolling the dice
'Cause I can feel that my time is now.
It must be like paradise.

Confused, reduced to a life where I'm no longer in control
All in all I got used to be
I'm not afraid, I played all the cards that I was dealt
But this is new, I'll just have to wait and see.

Some things will change -

In my dreams I am down on my knees
In my dreams I am begging you please
Let my soul rest in peace

Dreams sometimes I ask the Lord why
Mama back again in my dreams you are alive
I don't know reality or fiction
I guess you and the Lord guiding on my mission
Who am I an actor or musician
Dreaming all these years
Finally the right decision
I can't breathe my mind is wide open
Nightmares in the night bedsheet like an ocean
Sleeping deep I can hear god speak
Your life in my hands
Check the Bible read and preach
My eyes open begin to realize
I am still in my dreams
Who's the man in disguise
I start trippin' think a sec about the kitchen
Have to face the fact
About my future reputation
In addition minimize my ambition
Lord wake me up change my situation

Life is too short to live in anger
Can't stand these negative vibes
Life is too short too short to live with danger
Please help me God to survive

Dreams I can't just explain
They bug me out make me trip in so many ways
I want the truth nothing but the truth
Entire 411 I am going back to my roots
Woop woop that's the sound of the police
Young gifted black I am down on my knees
Irritated lost nowhere to go
Help me please rescue me I am losing control
The show must go on
I wanna have my piece of cake
Seperate good from the bad and fake
Snakes always wanna ride your jock and place
Their behinds in your face dispossess your space
In my dreams I see a picture of your face
Life is too short take a break
I wish good luck for you and yours
Dreams see me walking through that door

In my dreams God is talking to me
In my dreams I am down on my knees
In my dreams I am begging you please
Let my soul rest in peace

Could you ease my pain
And show me good things in my life
Could it be that I am just too blind

Without you, without you
Each song in my breast dies of bornin'
Without you, without you
Are you goin' away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well I should have loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind",The Last Thing on My Mind,1969
Nana Mouskouri,"The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top
The snow is softly fallin'
The air is still within the silence of my room
I hear your voice softly callin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead
My glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon the page
The words of love you sent me

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are liftin'
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane
Where whims of snow are driftin'

If I could only have you near to breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
And to be once again with, with you
To be once again with, with you

Nana Mouskouri,"Yes, I've been dreaming about you everyday
Each and every day
And I've been thinking about you
All night long, I even wrote a song

Just to try and tell you how I really feel
To make you understand my love is real
That you're on my mind all the time
I wish to God you were mine once again

I remember talking to you
I remember walking with you
I remember laughing all the time
When you were mine

Now the day seems so long
I can't face the night alone
I beg you please
Won't you please come home

Nana Mouskouri,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when he flies
Turning on the world the way he smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of his eyes

Waking in the morning to the feeling of his fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Coming close together with a feeling that I've never know before in my time
He ain't ashamed to be a man or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way he opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
And loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again",Loving Him Was Easier,1970

Got my money in my secret pocket

I'm dropping pebbles in my tracks
I will not get lost when I come back

On my way to town
Got my lunch tucked in another pocket
On my way to town
And I will only stop to wash it down
Cool water is good enough
Can't waste my gold on finer stuff

Got to keep your mind on the maps
Feet on the ground and eyes on the traps
Jewels that shine and the pleasures that blind
And ties that bind and you're left behind
I know this road
I was on it a long time ago
I know this road
And I know every mind that could explode
You got to keep walking on through the rain
Trees that shelter fall and bring you pain

And when I get to town
I will go straight to the market
When I get to town
I will do my best until the sun goes down
And come the end of day
I'll look for the stones I dropped along the way",On My Way to Town,1970

The cries at night, the nightmare fears

All were children like yourown
So long ago

But sons of tycoons or sons of the farm
All of their children run from your arms
Through fields of gold through fields of ruin
All of their chidren vanish too soon
In towering waves in walls of flesh
Among dying birds trembling with death
Sons of tycoons or sons of the farms
All of their children run from your arms
Sons of your sands or sons passing by

Children we lost in a lullaby
Sons of true love and sons of regret
All of their sons you cannot forget

Some went to war, some never came home

See your world that's new begun
Growing the land beneath our feet
Heaven sent across to eat crust
Hush-a-bye taste the sweetness of your years
By and by we'll all learn the taste of tears.

Open your eyes my growing son
There is hard work to be done
Follow your father to his toil
His bend your back and break the soil
Who can say what you sow beneath the sand
Day by day something stirs our sleeping land

Open your eyes my gentle son
Take your leave and take your gun
Follow your father through the hills to the hills
Heaven gives and heaven kills
Go with God and the youg men in their prime
Here I'll wait where I waited all through time

Open your eyes my beloved son
Is your day so quickly done ?
How can you fall asleep so soon
When the sun stands yet at noon ?
Walk with me where we walked spring ago
Come and see the flowers have begun to grow

If only I can find my way to you

Nana Mouskouri,"'Tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone 
All her lovely companions are faded and gone. 
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh 
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh. 
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! to pine on the stem 
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them 
'Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed 
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead. 
So soon may I follow, when friendships decay 
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away 
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown

And it's got the sweetest harmony
And as long as you want me to, I'm singing with you

La la la la la la
I'm singing my loving song
La la la la la la
I'm singing it all day long

Not a song that's going strong
On any music chart
Just a la la la la la la
Playing in my heart

It goes round and round with a special sound
That you hear wherever love is found
And loving you like I do, I'm singing with you

Nothing can go wrong when you've got a song
And there's someone else to sing along
And I hope I will live life through, singing with you

La la la la la la
I'm singing my loving song
La la la la la la
I'm singing it all day long

I wish that boats were little glasses filled with wine
So I could drink to love with all your friends and mine
Some day we'll pull your boat ashore
The day you sail away no more

My friend the sea says you'll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w'll be
And I believe my friend the sea

I wish the mountain was smaller than a star
So I could see your boat and know just where you are
I wish my arms were nuts of gold
For you are all I want to hold

My friend the sea says you'll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w'll be
And I believe my friend the sea
Some day I'll fill your boat with wine
My friend the sea will know you're mine

Nana Mouskouri,"There's a time, there's a time
Time for summer and for snow
Time for love to grow
And to end in lonely tears
There's a place I adore
That I fear I'll see no more
I will see no more
Though I live for a hundred years

There's a time for losing all you want
And a time for travelling on
But the hurt in my heart
It goes on from day to day
Will not go away
Keeps on longing for what's gone

There's a time, there's a time
When a love is young and new
Heaven's painted blue
When we lay in the summer grass
For a time, for a time
You were so in love with me
So how was I to see
That the summer would pass

Now you ride the ocean, change the star
Underneath some far away sky
And the hurt in my heart
Knows you're never coming home
Never coming home
Till the day the sea runs dry

In my dreams, in my dreams
You have left yourself behind
You caress my mind
When the nights grow dark and chill
Vagabond, vagabond
Always travelling beyong
Where's the magic wand
That will bring you nearer still

There's a time for holding to your dreams
And a time for starting a new
But the hurt in my heart
It goes from day to day
Never goes away
For it's all I have left of you",There Is a Time,1979
Nana Mouskouri,"If today was not on a lost highway
If tonight was not a crooked tale
If tomorrow was not such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

I can't see my reflection in the waters
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my foot-steps
Can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes and only if my true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
Only if he was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed...once again

There's beauty in the summer singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the skies
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes and only if my true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
Only if he was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed...once again",Tomorrow Is a Long Time,1979

Nana Mouskouri,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

From some small town I never knew
It told me you were on your way
But not where you were going to

You said you're following the sun
But do you really know for sure
For after all is said and done
Just what it is you' re looking for

There's a place in my heart
I wish that your eyes could see
And there' s no one on earth
Who loves you as much as me

If you just travel on and on
Till I don't know where
There's a place in my heart
You may never find again

And so you travel with the wind
You'll find some road to fly along
And though your letter says the word
Your heart may soon forget the song

Then you may someday write the poem
That tells your life in words of fire
But you will never have a home
Or find the love that you desire

There's a place in my heart
I wish that your eyes could see
And there' s no one on earth
Who loves you as much as me

If you just travel on and on
Till I don't know where
There's a place in my heart
You may never find again

And so heading for the sea
Now that the flowers are in bloom
Just when the wild mimosa tree
Is like the color of our room

Flood every newborn seed

And in the morals of despair

Don't have the inclination
To look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain
Of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment
I see the Master's hand
In every leaf that trembles
In every grain of sand

Oh, the flowers of indulgence
And the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath
Of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps
Of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness
And the memory of decay

I gaze into the doorway
Of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way
I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey
I come to understand
That every hair is numbered
Like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches
In the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream
In the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness
Fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence
On each forgotten face

I hear the ancient footsteps
Like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn there's someone there
Other times it's only me
I am hanging in the balance
Of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling
Like every grain of sand",Every Grain of Sand,1986

Nana Mouskouri,"Only love can make a memory 
Only love can make a moment last. 
You were there 
And all the world was young

When love was all, 
All you were living for, 
And how you gave that love to me. 
 
Only then I felt my heart was free, 
I was part of you and you were all of me. 
Warm were the days and the nights of those years, 
Painted in colors to outshine the sun.

Nana Mouskouri,"Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",The Rose,1986

Dans un village, on vit naître un jour
Un enfant à la peau de cuivre
Une gazelle le même jour,
Près de là commençait de vivre
D'un même lait et d'un même miel
On nourrit leurs amours naissantes
Les mêmes sourc's et le même ciel
Leur ouvrirent des fleurs géantes

Elle courait plus rapide que tous les vent
Que l'oiseau dans le ciel
Et s'arrêtait pour pouvoir entraîner
L'enfant dans sa course au soleil
Parce qu'un jour, il n'obéit pas
On garda le gamin loin d'elle
Des hommes blancs qui ne savaient pas
Ce jour-là ont tiré sur elle
Il a cherché tout un jour et toute une nuit
Son chemin dans le ciel
Il l'a trouvé toute froide et le dos rougi
Au deuxième soleil

On dit qu'il part au matin levant
Et ne rentre qu'à la nuit pleine
On dit aussi qu'il pleure en dormant

It seems I'm far away

Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn

Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

so mellow.

There's such an air
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song final
But how strange to change
From major to minor
Every time we say goodbye

Every single time we say goodbye",Every Time We Say Goodbye,1991
Nana Mouskouri,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies, my love
To the dark and the empty skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
And felt your heart beat close to mine
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

The first time ever I lay with you
I felt the earth move in my hand
I thought our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love
And last till the end of time

If you love me, really love me 
Let it happen, darling, I won't care 

Shall I catch a shooting star 
Shall I bring it where you are 
If you want me to, I will 
You can set me any task 
I will anything you ask 
If you'll only love me still

Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Love, love changes everything
Days are longer words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before
Love will turn your world around
And that world will last forever
Yes love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Off into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears
Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules we make are broken

Love will never never let you be the same

Love will never never let you be the same",Love Changes Everything,1991

Where the eagle all too often overtakes the dove
There is one thing in this life we can be certain of
Your love, my love

We will not despair

For we know that our salvation
Is the gift we share

Lock me, desert me

I'll get by love
Now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me
Now I'm sure of your love

When our castles crumble, when our dreams take flight
And we sometimes find it hard to face the morning light
There is one thing that will see us through the darkest night
Your love ,my love

I will never fear what fate may have in store
For with every passing year
I love you more and more
And as long as I'm alive

I will be living for

Nana Mouskouri,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind,1993

One tear that falls so furtively
From her sweet eyes has just sprung,
As if she envied all the youths
Who laughingly passed her right by.
What could I want more than this?
She loves me! I see it.
One moment just to hear her heart,
Beating so close next to mine,
To hear my sighs like they were hers,
Her sighings as if they were mine!
Heavens, please take me now:
All that I wanted is mine now!

Nana Mouskouri,"Quien no ha llorado diciendo un adiós 
Quien no lleva esa herida en el corazón 
Que ni el paso del tiempo ni un nuevo amor 
Han podido aplacar su dolor 

Quien no ha creido una noche soñar 
Que tan solo era un sueño la cruel realidad 
Quien por unos instantes no tuvo valor 
Deseando jamás despertar 

Nada me puede hacer olvidar 
El vacio que un día dejastes tú en mí 
Y si allá donde estes aún me puedes oir 
Hoy yo canto en recuerdo de Tí

Cada noche estrellada que veo salir 
A una sombra en mis ojos un brillo fugaz 
Cuando pienso que Tú ya no estás",En Recuerdo de Ti,1994

Granada, tierra soÃ±ada por mÃ­
Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti
Mi cantar, hecho de fantasÃ­a
Mi cantar, flor de melancolÃ­a
Que yo te vengo a dar

Granada, Manola cantaba en coplas preciosas
No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas
De sueÃ±o rebelde why gitano cubierta de flores
Why beso tu boca de grana jugosa manzana
Que me habla de amores

Granada, tierra ensangrentada en tardes de toros
Mujer que conserva el embrujo de tus ojos moros
De rosas de suave fragancia
Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena

Granada, tu tierra estÃ¡ llena
De lindas mujeres, de sangre why de sol

Cinco sirenitas te llevaran
Por caminos de algas y de coral
Y fosforescentes caballos marinos haran
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bajame la lampara un poco mas
Déjame que duerma, nodriza en paz
Y se llama él no le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y se llama él no le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo
Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros

Esto no puede ser no mas que una cancion
Quisiera fuera una declaracion de amor
Romantica sin reparar en formas tales
Que ponga freno a lo que siento ahora a raudales
Te amo
Te amo
Eternamente te amo
Si me faltaras no voy a morirme
Si he de morir quiero que sea contigo
Mi soledad se siente acompaÃ±ada
Por eso a veces se que necesito
Tu mano
Tu mano
Eternamente tu mano
Cuando te vi sabia que era cierto
Este temor de hallarme descubierto
Tu me desnudas con siete razones
Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas
De amores
De amores
Eternamente de amores
Si alguna vez me siento derrotado
Renuncio a ver el sol cada maÃ±ana
Rezando el credo que me has enseÃ±ado
Miro tu cara why digo en la ventana

Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield for dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass, young man lookin' in the shadows
That pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass for dignity

CHORUS #1:
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low, searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go, ""Have you seen Dignity?""

Blind man breakin' out of a trance, puts both his hands in the pocket of
Chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-lou, she said I don't want nobody see me
Talkin to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity

CHORUS #2:
I went down where the vultures feed
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men, wasn't any
Difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade, house on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, ""Have you seen dignity?""

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years for dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity

CHORUS #3:
Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand, steps goin' down into tatoo
Land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light, in the bordertowns of
Despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat, I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin'
Boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote about dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure, lookin' at his hands for the
Lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin his hair back his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity

CHORUS #4:
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed, dignity never been
Photographed
I went into the red, went into the black, into the valley of dry bone
Dreams

So many roads, so much at stake, so many dead ends, I'm at the edge of
The lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity

Ã?'ll be a friend
When you need someone to hold
When you're out in the cold
I'll take you in
Whenever you're lost in the night
And ther is no end in sight
I will show you the way,
Turn the night into day
Whenever you need me,
You just call my name, baby
You can count on me,
You can count on me,
Oh endlessly

3-
Everytime I see your face
I want to say a little prayer
Heaven's such a sacred place
Can you take me there?
Can you take me there?

This love of mine is a fire
Day after day it gets higher and higher
This love of mine is a mountain
So sure and so strong that you cannot doubt it, baby
This love of mine,ah-ha
This love of mine,ah-ha
This love of mine,ah-ha

The clouds have cornered my life again
The horizon has blinded my sight again
AndI know I must be strong 
Carrying on alone
Whenever my dreams have stormed 'till morning
You were there, an angel, a blesssing
No, I cannot see your smile
And I'm defenseless like a child

When love comes calling
You'd better be at home
Nobody knows the pain of walking
Through this life alone
When love comes calling
Open up your door
They say that those who love grow stronger
Than they ever did before

And I believe there's still time to love somebody
Yes, there's still time to hold someone
'Cause my life has been an empty story
Tossed and turned on every stone
But I pray there's time enough to find the one
My heart is longing for

Nana Mouskouri,"""The night is cold, the air is still""
The earth lies frozen in the chill
My fingers idly trace your name
Across the icy window pane
The stars look down so bright and clear
I close my eyes and wish you near
""You come to me, you always do""
I dreamed you
All at once the winter's done
And warm my field the summer sun
We walked through fields where flowers grow
The way we did so long ago
I leave this weary world behind
And softly find you in my mind
'Cause lying in the morning dew
I dreamed you
I dreamed your fingers touched my face
I feel you're locked in my embrace
""As once more you are mine, but now...""
The summer sun is growing dim
I stand here lonely in the wind
And hear the sounds of spring no more
For like so many times before
You drift away and I recall
But you were never here at all

Wonder how I got along

And everytime that I was down
You would always come around
Get my feet back on the ground

Over the sea to skye

Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
Thunder clouds rend the air;
Baffled our foe's stand on the shore
Follow they will not dare

Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep
Ocean's a royal bed
Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head

Many's the lad fought on that day
Well the claymore could wield
When the night came, silently lay
Dead on Culloden's field

Burned are our homes, exile and death
Scatter the loyal men
Yet, e'er the sword cool in the sheath,
Charlie will come again.

*note: This song commemorates the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie from these
Shores when Flora MacDonald took him, disguised as a serving maid,
From Uist to Skye in a small boat.
Flora is buried at Kilmuir on the north coast of Skye. Prince Charlie
Near Rome where he was born.

Nana Mouskouri,"There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees and forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Lil' Jimmy Brown was born

So his parents brought him to the chapel
When he was only one day old
And the priest blessed the little fellow
Welcomed him into the fold

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing
Was for baby, Jimmy Brown

There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy Brown was to meet his love

Many friends were gathered in the chapel
And many tears of joy were shed
In June on a Sunday morning
When Jimmy Brown and his bride were wed

All the chapel bells were ringing
'T was a great day in his life
All the songs that they were singing
Were for Jimmy and his wife

From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul wound its way to Heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away

Silent people gathered in the chapel
To say, ""Farewell"" to their old friend
Whose life had been like a flower
Budding, blooming 'till the end

Just a lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
'T was farewell that it was singing
To our good old, Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation""
Make his soul find a salvation
Of thy great eternal love""

Nana Mouskouri,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Sulla vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E' una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica

Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide uscire
La luna da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte

Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma e un falso
Che con un po'di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti quardano
Cosi vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensierei

'cause diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti la in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Dietro la scia di un'elica

Ma si, e la vita che finisce
E non ce penso poi tanto
Anzi, si sentiva gia felice
E ricomincio il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Now that spring is in the air

We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

You would always come around
Get my feet back on the ground

Nana Mouskouri,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.
",Tapestry,1998

I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go

When twighlight is fading I pensively rove;
Or at the bright moontide in solitude wander,
Amid the dark shades of the lonely Ash Grove;
'Twas there, while the blackbird was cheerfully singing,
I first met that dear one the joy of my heart!
Around us for gladness the bluebells were ringing,
Ah! then little thought I how soon we should part.]

Still warbles the blackbird its note from the tree;
Still trembles the moonbeam on streamlet and fountain,

I heard a maid sing in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""
Remember the vows that you made to me truly
Remember how tenderly you nestled close to me
Gay is the garland, fresh are the roses
I've culled from the garden to bind over thee.

Here I now wander alone as I wonder
Why did you leave me to sigh and complain
I ask of the roses, why should I be forsaken,
Why must I here in sorrow remain?

Through yonder grove, by the spring that is running
There you and I have so merrily played,
Kissing and courting and gently sporting
Oh, my innocent heart you've betrayed

How could you slight so a pretty girl who loves you
A pretty girl who loves you so dearly and warm?
Though love's folly is surely but a fancy,
Still it should prove to me sweeter than your scorn.

Soon you will meet with another pretty maiden
Some pretty maiden, you'll court her for a while,
Thus ever ranging, turning and changing
Always seeking for a girl that is new.

Thus sang the maiden, her sorrows bewailing
Thus sang the poor maid in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""",Early One Morning,2000

Don't go to strangers
Darling, come on to me

For when you hear a call
To follow your heart
You'll follow your heart
I know
I've been through it all
And I'm a old hand
And I'll understand
If you close up

So make your mark
For your friends to see
But when you need
More than company
Don't go to strangers
Darling, come to me

Don't go to strangers
Darling, come on to me



",Don't Go to Strangers,2000
Nana Mouskouri,"Hold me, hold me
Never let me go
Until you've told me, told me
What I want to know
And just hold me, hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you
(Hold me tight, never let me go)
Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)
They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do
I know that you will miss me, miss me
If we ever say adieu, so kiss me, kiss me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you","Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me",2000
Nana Mouskouri,"My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you

And let me be lonely
You won't believe me

The right time for kissing
But night time is my time
For just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting
With somebody else

There'll be no one , unless
That someone is you, you, you
I intend to be independently blue, blue, blue
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow

And to give back tomorrow

When your heart is on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes""
So I shut them, and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I'm without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide

A lovely melody
Our hearts will sing along
In perfect harmony
But you forgot all the words
While I still remember the tune

Each time our lips will cling
I heard a silly name
Of love when you can spring
Forever to be played
But you forgot all the words
When I still remember the tune

We used to dance
Instead of walk
We used to sing
Instead of talk
Why with a love song that used to be
All the stars are blue for me

But songs are funny things
They never really die
And so my hope still clings
That someday you will try
To just remember the words

How many gentle flowers grow
In an English country garden?
I'll tell you now of some I know
And those I'll miss I hope you'll pardon
Daffodils, heart's ease and flox
Meadowsweet and lilly stalks
Gentain, lupine and tall hollihocks
Roses, foxgloves, snowdrops, forget-me-nots
In an English country garden.

How many insects find their home
In an English country garden?
I'll tell you now of some I know
Those I miss I hope you'll pardon
Dragonflies, moths and bees
Spiders falling from the trees
Butterflies sway in the mild gentle breeze
There are hedgehogs that roam
And little gnomes
In an English country garden.

How many songbirds make their nests
In an English country garden?
I'll tell you now of some I know
Those I miss I hope you'll pardon
Bobolink, coo cooing doves
Blacbirds and the whirlwind thrush
Bluebird, lark, pigeon, nightingale
We all smile in the spring
When the birds all start to sing
In an English country garden.

Robin, don't forget the Robin.

By love's light my foot finds the old path way to thee.

And my father won't slight for your lack of kind
And he stepped away from me and this he did say
""It will not be long,love,till our wedding day
He stepped away from me and he went through the fair
And fondly I watched him move here and move there
And then he went honward with one star awake
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake
The people were saying ""No two were e'er wed
But one had a sorrow that never was said
And I smile as he passed with his goods and his gear
And that was the last that I saw of my dear

So softly he came that his feet made no din

Mamma's got her chicken soup of love 
For the bad old world is sick with hate

That you can hum when you're alone

That opens up another door
And finds someone comes back for more

Maybe this time
The cards will treat you right
Deal a little magic in the middle of some lonely night
Maybe this time, this time

I always smile, act caviler
But what I feel behind the smiles, a little fear
I'm just like you, nobody's fool
Whenever someone gets to close I play it cool

But maybe this time
We'll find the other key that opens up another door
And find someone comes back for more

You turn to go but then you hesitate
I wonder can I make you wait
Aren't we a pair afraid to care?

I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Now just a memory the tears that I cried
Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed
Dreams that I cherished all have come true
All my tomorrows I give to you

Over and over I whisper your name
Over and over I kiss you again
I see the light of love in your eyes
Love is forever, no more good-byes

Life's summer leaves may turn into gold
The love that we share will never grow old
Here in your arms no words far away
Her in your arms forever I'll stay

You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.
And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.
Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.",Suzanne,2002

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you

Haven't found him yet

For this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he
Turns out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some girls think of
As handsome
To my heart
He carries the key

A man is born but he's no good no how

And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind""
And she stepped away from me and this she did say,
""It will not be long, love, till our wedding day""

She stepped away from me, and she went thro' the fair.
And fondly I watched her move here and move there.
And then she went homeward with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake.

So softly she came that her feet made no din.
And she laid her hand on me, and this she did say

As every fairy tale comes real.

But now old friends are acting strange.

Nana Mouskouri,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life tha's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit it off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and threw it out, I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subsides
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a woman, what has she got?
If not herself, then she has naught
To say the things she truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

",My Way,2006
Nana Mouskouri,"Sometimes I remember the old days
When the world was filled with sorrow
You might have taught I was living
But I was all alone, in my heart the rain was falling
The wind blew, the night was calling
Come back, come back, I'm all you've ever known

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you my friend
You're like a rainbow coming around the bend
And when I see you happy,well it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you as you are to me

There were friends who could always see me
Through the haze, their smiles would reach me
Saying ""OK "" saying goodbye, saying hello
Now we've perhaps stormy weather, the sunshine though
When we' re together I' ll be your friend, right through to the end

Open the door and come on in

Nana Mouskouri,"Baby,
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes.""",Smoke Gets Your Eyes,2006
Nana Mouskouri,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Nana Mouskouri,"When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

Is when I fall in love with you.

Nana Mouskouri,"Across the morning sky all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the Winter's fire

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah and yet they know it time for them to go

But I will still be here
I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near
And I know it will be so until it's time to go

So count the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

And who knows where the time goes?

Nana Mouskouri,"In a world as changeable as skies above
Where the eagle all too often overtakes the dove
There is one thing in this life we can be certain of
Your love, my love

Nation fights with nation, everyday somewhere
But through every situation we will not despair
For we know that our salvation is the gift we share
Your love, my love

Lock me, desert me
I'll get by love, now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me, now I'm sure of your love

When our castles crumble and our dreams take flight
And we sometimes find it hard to face the morning light
There is one thing that will see us through the darkest night
Your love, my love

I will never fear what fate may have in store
For with every passing year, I love you more and more
And as long as I'm alive, I will be living for
Your love, my love

Lock me, desert me
I'll get by love, now you're my love
Nothing can hurt me
Now, I'm sure of your love

In a world where peace and harmony are strange
And whatever dreams our destiny may rearrange
There is one thing on this earth that time will never change
Your love, my love, your love, our love

I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.

I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup

Who is the top Dogg of them all?""
There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard""
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my White Sox, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset
She said um

It's all because of you, I'm feeling said and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me

Damn, now what was I to do
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, ""Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother steps then says to me ""Hi!""
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, ""What was going on?""
I tried to break up, I said, ""Stop it, just leave her!""
She said, ""If I can't smoke none, she can't either!""
She grabbed my closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbing my dick
And saying

Why don't you give me a play
So we can brake it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said, ""Cheer up!"" so I gave her a hit
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!""
She said, ""No you're not,"" then she starts crying
I says I'm nineteen, she says, ""Stop lying!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover""

I'm wasting my time counting
Stains on a barroom floor
Thinking 'bout my hometown
And the friends I'll leave behind
Mostly 'bout the man who writes
His songs with smiling rhymes
And I'm holding on to a smokey view
Of his dreams in the midnight light

Michael counts his songs
In the years of wasted miles
I used to think he was really part
Of that fantasy in rhyme
But looking back on all his tunes
Of butterflies and sunshine
There was only one about the
Man he kept inside
About the time he crossed the line
And let a tear come to his eye

I used to hide out
In his pretty smile
And hope it would shine me
Through the morrow
Until I learned the way
It feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile
Without a soul to share his sorrow

The light here at the freeway
Well, it's turning green to gold
The stains on that barroom floor
Ten miles back down the road
Thinking 'bout how that old bar
Brought Michael back to mind
And how I can sing his blues
And be smiling here inside
I guess a weary soul will always

I used to hide out
In his pretty smile
And hope it would shine me
Through the morrow
Until I learned the way
It feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile
Without a soul to share his sorrow",Michael's Song,1978
Nanci Griffith,"Well, it's that old time story
Of a new face to glory
Someone wanted my soul for their pride
What about the system
Of fools arranged for missing
Well, I can't lie, they all pass with time

Why do my people come and go?
I keep on leaving them behind
And Lord, I miss them so
I've watched my heroes change from
Silver into gold
As the time goes, only memories grow

It's your smiles that I remember
The dreams of the young and tender
Coming real, but now it seems
That highways are for foolish travelers
Always bonded, always shackled
By the prayer that they're remembered
In our dreams

Why do my people come and go?
I keep on leaving them behind
Lord, I miss them so
I've watched my heroes change from
Silver into gold
As the time goes, only memories grow

I am just a barroom child
Tried so damn hard to learn the style
Of your drunken tears, the way they smile
I guess I'll never learn the rules
I still play the simple fool
Who loves without the chains of lies

Why do my people come and go?
I keep on leaving them behind
And Lord, I miss them so

Silver into gold

And see what makes it shine, Mary Margaret?
It's almost morning, and we've talked all night,
You know we've made big plans for ten-year-olds,
You and I.

Have you met my new boy friend, Margaret?
His name is John, and he rides my bus to school,
And he holds my hand.
He's fourteen, he's my older man.
But we'll still be the best of friends,
The three of us, Margaret, John, and I.

Let's go to New York City, Margaret!
We'll hide out in the subways
And drink the poets' wine, oh,
But I had John, so you went and I stayed behind.
But you were home in time for the senior prom,
When we lost John.

The fantasies we plan, I'm living them now.
All the dreams we sang when we knew how,
Well, they haven't changed.
There's never been two friends like you and me,

It's nice to see you family growing, Margaret.
Your daughter and your husband there,
They really treat you right...
But we've talked all night
And what about the light, that glowed beyond
Our woods when we were ten?
You were the rambler then.

The fantasies we planned, well, Maggie,
I'm living them now.

How, but I haven't changed.

All the angry times we shared
All the feelings and the
Sorrows come and gone
We have let them slip away
Because I'm standing here today
And I'm smiling at your old
West Texas sun

I remember times
When you'd weathered out my mind
But you always had a peaceful
Word to say
And you could always bring a smile
With the mischief in your eyes
Still, I'm glad the miles
Keep me separate from your games

You know you're still as wild
As those old west Texas plains
Standing by the highway
Do you still call my name?
Lord, I can't believe
It's been such a long, long time
Since I've seen that Texas boy smile

Well, I'll be heading out of town
I may stop by next time around
Hell, it's raining, but at least
That's something real
I came shackled down with fears
About our dreams and wasted years
And now I know exactly how to feel

It's a harvest moon when she's home to count her blessings
She's saved that love from passing

[Chorus:]
Heart of a miner, kept her feelings buried deep
Heart of a miner, could there be something she needs?
Just a treasure that could hold her
That's not fool's gold

I was waitin' for my Omie to take me outta this south
It was me and my sisters, like to wore that front porch out

[Chorus:]
And there can't be more to this livin' than loving my Omie
We're both sittin' back here watchin' our children grow
If there's a better ace in the deck,
Well, baby, come on and show me,
If you ain't got a hand then get on your wheel and roll,
'cause there could never be a better hand than these hearts I hold

Me and my Omie, we settled down here in Houston
Oh, and one by one, we moved my sisters west
We bought a house in the suburbs and we've got four fine children
We are black middle class because Omie wouldn't settle for less

My children are the first thing in my mornin``
My Omie is the last thing in my night

And I bless my daddy for the love within that house
But, I thank my Omie for takin' me outta the south

look at these hearts I hold, oh, look at these hearts I hold
look at these hearts I hold, there ain't no place like home

take a look at those hearts you hold!",Mary and Omie,1984
Nanci Griffith,"Oh the grace that true love holds when hearts grow weary for
Time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold

And it'll always come home

Hearts know when they should fly alone
When the mind is rested and the heart's at ease,
Two loves can give to each other's needs
Oh, the grace that true love holds when hearts grow weary for
Time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold

And it'll always come home
You can fool yourself and fool your dreams
But you can't fool your heart and you can't fool me

Where the wintertime speaks softly in the fallin' rain
I'm goin' back to my green eyed lover there
And we will dance along the banks of old Lake Pontchartrain

Where the voices ring like bells in French-Canadian
And the rivers stand imprisoned till the thaws

Sinking like a stone
Deep in my heart I can hear love callin'

Nanci Griffith,"Oh, he said it was the sound of the winter callin'
From up around the bend
Or it could be the cry of your restless heart

They keep on slappin' my face with dust so thick
That the tears won't roll again

Last of the true believers
Have you grown weary all alone?
You could go home again,home again,home
Last of the true believers
You pack your things and go back home
You could go home again,home again,home

'cause they say love doesn't last that long

It's shelter from the cold"".

My youth was so crazy, my heart was so lazy
Love never could stand me still
But, love's found a shoulder now that I'm older
With plenty of time to kill

Oh, I'm gonna take us back where we belong
Where you can see it in the stars that the weather's comin' on
One of these days

Now, our Daddy's grew cotton, spittin' dust of a mornin'
We met on a school bus rollin' thru the Autumn fields our Daddy's raised
Beneath a hot August sky, our Mothers waved goodbye
My Daddy tipped his hat with a tear in his eye
When we left for the city where the sun rarely shines
It was a hundred and two in the shade

Watch the skaters go

[Chorus:]
I made up my mind late last night
That I would leave your city behind
Oh, and love is not in question
When you're holding the answer
In your cold heart and your closed mind
You've got a cold heart and a closed mind

Out in these streets these people are angry
Well, they push and shove one another aside
Well, I worked from the heart and you worked for the money
But I paid the price for your will to survive

Nanci Griffith,"She drove west from Salt Lake City to the California coastline.
She hit the San Diego Freeway doing sixty miles an hour.
She had a husband on her bumper, she had five restless children.
And she was singing as sweet as a mockingbird in that Ford Econoline. 

And she's the salt of the earth,
Straight from the bosom of the Mormon church,
With a voice like wine,
Cruising along in that Ford Econoline. 

Her husband was a gambler, he was a Salt Lake City rambler,
And he built a golden cage around his silver-throated wife.
So many nights he left her crying with his cheating and his lying,
But his big mistake was in buying her that Ford Econoline. 

She's the salt of the earth,
Straight from the bosom of the Mormon church,
With a voice like wine,
Cruising along in that Ford Econoline.

Now she sings her songs around this country from Seattle to Montgomery,

Along the back roads of our nation, she's become a living legend,
She drives a Coupe De Ville but her heart rides still in that Ford Econoline.

Where the Peabody Hotel meets the velveteen sky
She sings like the waves in the cool Mississippi
That brought her from St. Paul in '75
And men come to court her with roses and sweet wine
Where hands cross the ivories from six until nine
She sings away sorrow each night when she leaves him
She goes home alone,
She's not the marrying kind

[Chorus:]
Love is a memory that she'll always hold
Cause love in a memory never grows old
Why she did leave him, well nobody knows
Love in a memory never grows old

Now he works the toll booth on the New Jersey Turnpike
The ring on his finger grows cold to the bone

Ribbons and long curls
Reflections of yesterdays past
Headlines and footlights
Wee hours and long nights
Keep everything moving so fast

It's taken a long time
And she's walked a fine line
For fortune and fame have arrived
She kept on striving
And half-way surviving
Till part of those dreams came alive

[Chorus:]
Now she wishes she looked like they tell her she looks all the time
What she'd give just to feel like she tells them she's feelin' just fine
All that money she makes every night ain't as much as it seems
Cause it's a dollar a wrinkle and less than a nickel a dream

Well, her heart may be breaking
But she keeps on taking what she thought she wanted back then
It's too late to change her,
There's always a stranger to tell her she's someone again

Nanci Griffith,"Summer Sunday evening, around the old home place
Well, I would play my guitar and sister sang along
Sister's smile would always light up my Daddy's face
And when they'd get to dancing, well they'd dance all night till dawn

[Chorus:]
And I would sing one for sister 
Play one for Papa, moan one for mama 
Then I'd cry one for you. 

Mama liked the slow ones and she'd shuffle 'cross the floor
Sister liked the fast ones, Lord she could step so high
And I'd see my Daddy dancing, till he could dance no more
And when I'd play a sad song, well he would start to cry

And here I am again
I'm in the company of strangers
It's a cold winter wind that sings a song
You say your love is lost
I'm not the kind who lingers on
So it's farewell to your heart
Cause when the love is gone, it's gone.

I never did feel lonely till I looked in the mirror and all I could see
Was a little bit of you in the corner of an eye in need of a good night's sleep

Down in this lonely town there's a lovely silver frost

We are nursing, pretending
Cursing then defending
And yet it's never ending
Makes ya' wonder when those sweet
Dreams will come

I am lookin' for some love
I guess that's why people buy dogs
Is there someone up above?
And I wonder is the Captain keeping
Logs
I am cursing and I'm praying
Not knowing what we're saying
And yet, it's everydaying
And I wonder when those sweet dreams
Will come

I feel like a fire
In the morning when the fire is out
I am walking on the wire
And the wire's what the whole
Thing is about
The pretender is thinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's a beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come

Don't cha wonder when those sweet
Dreams will come

Nanci Griffith,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow-capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land

It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band

Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
It's the hope of hopes, It's the love of loves
It's the song of every man",From a Distance,1988
Nanci Griffith,"I Would Bring You Ireland 
I would bring you Ireland
The cool sweet of the Dublin rain
If you would keep my heart for me
In the quiet of your Texas days
And my old friend, will you shelter me from pain
In return I'd bring you Ireland

One day I'll build a tower
High upon my Texas plains
I can see from coast to coast
On hot platinum summer days
When the dust is still, and the cotton prays for rain
And the thirsty passers-by wonder why they came

I dreamed of Amarillo
On a foreign night in Dublin
The dust was on my pillow
When the raindrops started falling
In a hotel window, where I could see his rainbow
And I thought I'd send my heart to you
Cause that's the way the wind blows

And I'll reclaim my heart one day
We'll sit and watch your children play
And I will bring you lullabies
From the Emerald Isles for back porch days
And my old friend we will always meet again

Hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine

And Eddie was a sweet romancer
And a darn good dancer
And they waltzed the aisles of the five and dime

And they'd sing
Dance a little closer to me
Hey, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight

Dance a little closer to me
Hey, it's closing time 
And love's on sale
Tonight at this five and dime

Eddie played the steel guitar
And his mama cried 'cause he played in the bars
And he kept young Rita out late at night

Soon they married up in Abelene
Lost a child in Tennessee
But still that love survived

And they'd sing
Dance a little closer to me
Hey, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight

Took a shine to Rita's hand

Singin' a different tune
Sporting Miss Rita back by his side

And they'd sing
Dance a little closer to me
Hey, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight

Eddie played in the barroom band
'Til arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side

And Rita's got her house to keep

I read your warm words from the plains
While the poets say that I should never
Be thinking of you this way

They say that I misread your lines
Because I've been lonely all my life
And I'd be reaching for some silver
And leave my heart out in the fire

Have you seen the folks in line downtown at the station
They're all buying their ticket out and talking the great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
But if we sell that new John Deere
And then we'll work these crops with sweat and tears
You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
Come harvest time we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love, here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
And there's a little bit of you and a little bit of me

Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;

'To Bethlehem, be not afraid, 
For there you'll find this happy morn,

Directed by a glorious star,

Where our beloved Messiah was, 
They humbly laid at his feet, 
Their gifts of gold and incense sweet.",The Wexford Carol,1989

With their heads on their chests,
They told lies about whiskey on a womans breath

Yes, and some tell the story of young Mickey Free
Who lost an eye to a buck deer in the Tongue River Valley
Oh and some tell the story of California Joe
Who sent word through the Black Hills
There was a mountain of gold

And the gold she lay cold in their pockets
And the sun she sets down on the trees
And they thank the Lord
For the land that they live in

With some news that he'd read in some St. Joseph paper
And it was Drinks all around cause the news he was tellin'
Was the one they called Crazy
Has been caught and been dealt with

And the Easterner he read the news from the paper
And the old ones moved closer so's they could hear better
Well it says here that Crazy Horse
Was killed while trying to escape,
And that was some time last September,
It don't give the exact date

Then the talk turned back to whiskey and women

Fore he goes

Who sweeps up the floor

No. I don't live
Across the water
Hey, I live right here
On this corner
Just a bank account away from
America

I won't hurt your family
I don't want a house there on your street
And I know you think that I'm
As lazy as a hobo's sigh
Now, you call me down 'n' outer
If there's a way out
I've not found 'er
I only want to earn my piece of America

Nanci Griffith,"I am fragile in the morning
I grow stronger in the day
I can sprint like a new spring doe
By the fall of the night
Love has chased me down
Through the cities and the towns
Until I stood beside the road
And let it pass me by
Like a fool I've missed the rain
Cause I was crying

[Chorus:]
Then you are calling
Call my heart awake from years of slumber
And then I'm falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer
Can you hold me?
Though I am inclined to
Leave my home and wander
Can you keep me,
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer?
Fields of summer
Fields of summer
I am falling
Like a child head over heel
In fields of summer

Now that you have caught me
Are you sure you really want me?
Though I'm fragile as December
On your shoulder in the dawn
And when the day has made me stronger,
Can you satisfy my hunger?
When the night has come and I would race the moon
Across the sky,
Would you chase me through
Those open fields of summer

Hold me?
Hold me?

There I will lay me down

Heaven is in your eyes

I think I'll go to Heaven

And if I can be someone who
Never needs a disguise
Then maybe I'll go to Heaven

People in Heaven never look back
Higher and higher

Nanci Griffith,"Everybody packs their goals
And sails away for better shores

I need a hometown street where the boys are pretty
And a friend is still a friend
I need a hometown street where the love you're given
Surely comes back 'round again

With faces that you've always known
But, you'll never see them

Oh, the power lines
They go from sea to sea
They carry voices

You are lost beneath the power lines

And no place that you call your home
There's no place that you cannot go

And the tools to build another's dream
That connects them to the power lines
You do not feel you need

Never saw the sunshine till I turned out the light
Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody till I needed the song

Never saw the white line till I was leavin' you behind
Never knew I needed you till I was caught up in a bind
And I never spoke I love you till I cursed you in vain
Never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane

Never saw the East coast until I moved to the West
I never saw the moonlight till it shone off your breast
And I never saw your heart till someone tried to steal it away
Never saw your tears till they rolled down your face

I never saw the morning till I stayed up all night
Never saw the sunshine till you turned out the light
Never saw my home town till I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody till I needed the song

Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
Where the years went I can't say
I just turned around and they've gone away

I've been siftin' through the layers
Of dusty books and faded papers
They tell a story I used to know
And it was one that happened so long ago

It's gone away in yesterday

Softly as the night was fallin'

Nanci Griffith,"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love
I'm sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing?

There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Maybe silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be owning

Oh, I might be gone a long ol' time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing?

How can, how can you ask me again?
Well it only brings me sorrow
Oh, the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailing
Saying, I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling

If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roaming
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're going

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of stormy weather
And yes, there is something you can send back to me

",Boots of Spanish Leather,1993
Nanci Griffith,"It's a long and dusty road
It's a hot and heavy load
And the folks I meet ain't always kind
Some are bad and some are good
Some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound
Where I'm bound
I can't help but wonder where I'm bound

I've been wandering through this land
Just doin' the best I can
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see
Look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wanderin', too

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound
Where I'm bound
I can't help but wonder where I'm bound

And I had me a buddy back home
But he started out to roam
And I hear, he's out by Frisco Bay
And, sometimes when I've had a few
His old voice comes ringin' through
And I'm goin' out to see him some old day

If you see me passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too
Just nail your shoes to the kitchen floor
Lace 'em up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

It's a long, long way
It gets further by the day
It's a long, long way from Clare to here

My Ma would like a letter home but I'm too tired for writing

Chorus

It almost breaks my heart when I think of my family
I told them I'd be coming home with my pockets full of green

The only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking
It can sort of ease the pain of it and it levels out my thinking

I dream I see white horses dance upon that other ocean

Why do you ride for your money?
Why do you rope for short pay?
You ain't gettin' nowhere
And you're losin' your share

Daughter of a miner
And her ways were free and it seemed to me
The sunshine walked beside her

She came to Spencer, across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she's come to look for work
She was not seeking favors
For a dime a day and a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

But the times were hard Lord, and the jobs were few
All through Tecumseh Valley
But she asked around and a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's

She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied, her pa had died
The word come down from Spencer

So she turned a whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man returned again
To lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died was a note that cried
Fare thee well, Tecumseh Valley

And her ways were free and it seemed to me

He was standing by the highway
With a sign that just said Mother
When he heard a driver coming
About a half a mile away
So he held the sign up higher
Where no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by Boulder Dam that day

He was raised up in Milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singing songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in Boulder I don't know

Chorus
And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the morning sun
Back in Boulder he had told her
I don't know when, I've had a better friend

It was out in Arizona
That he heard the lady listening
To each word that he was saying
To each line that he would write
So he sat down at her table
And they talked about the weather
98.6 and rising down by Boulder Dam that night

Chorus

Now he's traded off his Martin
Though his troubles ain't over
His feet are almost frozen and the sun is sinking low
Won't you listen to me brother, if you ever loved your mother
Please pull off on the shoulder, if you're goin' Milwaukee way
It's ten degrees and getting colder down by Boulder Dam today

Nanci Griffith,"This old town should've burned down in 1929
That's when we stood in line
Waiting for our soup
Swallowing our pride

This old town should've burn down in 1931
When the rain refused to come
Air filled up our bellies, dust filled up our lungs
And we thought our time had come

This old town was built by hand
In the dust bowl of the motherland
There must be rock beneath this sand
Oh' I'll be damned, this town still stands

This old town should've burned down in 1944
When the last men went to war
They came back different
If they came back at all

This old town should've burned down in 1956
That's when the twister hit
And all our hopes were buried
Beneath the boards and bricks
And we almost called it quits

This old town was built by hand
In the dust bowl of the motherland
There must be rock beneath this sand
Oh' I'll be damned, this town still stands

Somewhere in the distance
The city lights do shine
The sidewalks gleam with neon dreams
That call from time to time

When my children's children
Ask me why didn't I go
They say the heart of any town
Is the people that you've known
They'll always call you home

Now it was empty and this the last time
There were blinking pictures
Of how we'd sit and chat
Some of them are scattered
Others shattered in my mind

In the winter, a-chatterin' cold
While the building shook like ragweed in the wind
Stories from the heat pipes

Bicycles squeezed down alley ways into view
And towels warmed on oven doors

I know we must be out by tomorrow mornin'
But am I goin' 'gainst my will

We played cards, mostly blackjack
As we sat out on the tarmac
We sang songs we knew in Spanish
As we both loved songs of language

I would give anything

And I said I was too clumsy 
That I broke the wings of the loves I found

Nanci Griffith,"I look out on these shields of heather
Across this countryside
I wonder how they've grown together
While people live such separate lives
I think I'll stay inside for the winter
Cause the weather's in my bones
And the wind could shatter bone to splinter
Then howl me back home
 
[Chorus:]
I'm fragile as the lady of the harbour
Fragile as her torch that glows
Fragile as these gulf stream waters
To the Texas coast
To the Texas coast

I stared up at the faces in the mountain
Just a year ago
Laughin' in the spirit of America
And singin' in the snow
Now I wish I felt as strong as that mountain
Just carved in stone
I wish I was the gulf stream water
And I could sail you home

[Chorus]

I would give you all that's in me
Though part of me is gone
If I could have that day upon the mountain
For the snow and the song
But here's to love and all that it changes
When you're alone out in that storm
Cause' if I'd had a shield of heather
I'd have never loved at all

Nanci Griffith,"Flippin' bottle caps through the ring around the moon
All alone on a Saturday night with the stars in bloom

All by my own will

But it's just me and this old moon

[Chorus:]
And the sailors on the water
They all want the captain's daughter
They want her beauty and her youth
To grace their bow out on the sea

As plain can be
Got a bank full of mother's dreams
Maybe mother just didn't see
That love would be the only thing
Her daughter would ever need

The one thought not worth breakin'
I am the late blooming rose
With only her mother's dream to hold
On this less travelled road
Who really knows
Maybe the hearts not taken
Are truly made of gold

I'm gonna flip one more bottle cap up at the moon
I've got an early call with so much work to do

I love you, too

Five thousand miles away

You're the one thing I never thought
I could live without
And I just found this smile to think about you
You're a Saturday night
Far from the madding crowd

The buskers sing by candle light
In front of Bewleys Store
A young nun offers me a chair
At a table by the door
And I feel compelled to tell her
Of the sisters that we knew
How when they lit their candles
I'd say a prayer for you

The church bells ring for holy hour
And I'm back out in the rain

In a house out on the plains

That you are weaving?

Staring at the sky
I'm thinking of my childhood
And I'm trying not to cry
While a stranger sleeps against me
And it feels like I'm his wife

Like the pages of my life
My heart is on the baggage rack
It's heavy as can be

Who would carry it for me
Just to pay it some attention
And to handle it with care
Because it has been dropped
And is in need of some repair

Some things I guess
Some things I wish that I could learn
To express
Like the way that I feel
As I stare at the sky
And I remember your voice
And the sound, of goodbye

Maybe it's the autumn chill
Maybe it's the rain
Maybe I should wake the stranger
And ask him his name
But, my eyes they would betray me
And my words could not defend
No, I must learn to wait my turn
Before I love again

Can hear

Missing pages I cannot seem to find
These days your face
In my memory

On the Gulf Breeze circuit

Won't let us miss a thing

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

She was courted by young Vandermeer
And quite handsome was he I am to hear
He brought her silver rings and lacy things
And they promised to marry before the snows came that year

But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us, one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet in his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beautyin Virginia City too
At dusty sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

When you ride the big airplane
All they will call you

They took all the money
He made in his life

Come working the fruit trees
And they rode on the trucks
'Til they took down and died

And we died in your deserts
We died in your valleys
We died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees
And we died in your bushes
Both sides of that river
We died just the same

Over Los Gatos Canyon
Like a fireball of lightning
And shook all our hills
Who are all those friends
All scattered like dry leaves
The radio says
They are just deportees

We can grow our best orchards?

In various ways
Troubles he had some
But wasn't forgotten

I packed up my suitcase
Pulled down my old bedroll
And I started to wander
Far from my home
And the time it passed quickly
And the days seemed to be hours
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town

Well, I wandered through the midnights
Of sea-bordered bar lights
And I wandered through the forests
As deep as the sea
But I never got lonesome
Until I'd hear a sad song
One to remind me of Yarrington Town

Well, I followed a miner
To his home in the North woods
And he promised to love me
As long as I'd stay
And I even saw lightning
Touch a stone in the mine field
Could not touch the lightning
In Yarrington Town

So I packed up my suitcase
I pulled out my old bedroll
And I started to wander
On back to my home
And the time it passed slowly
And the days seemed to be years
Far from your city
And Yarrington Town
I'm going home to your city
And Yarrington Town

Just to ease my pain

You were on my mi-i-i-ind and

While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears;
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered
Around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say;
Oh, hard times come again no more

[Chorus]

There's a pale sorrowed maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart whose better days are o'er
Though her voice would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
'Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
'Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave

I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land
I'd hammer out danger

And we ran so blindly through the fields of summer cane
Now when I'm lonely, I send my heart down to New Orleans
To chase my memories alone down through my dreams

How I miss the clarity I left there in my youth
Will there be another heart who can endure my solitude?

Their petals do recall the mysteries in his eyes

Through fireside parties, tears and cheers
And the hands of James Hooker flew over it's keys
And God know who else 'fore it came to me

And when I was alone I could be Julie Gold
It rang her ""From A Distance"" just like it was my own

Mornings in this corner, that piano and me

I could play Jimmy Webb or perhaps Randy Newman
Ah, it's a blessing, it never met Jerry Lee's feet
Just the hands of those children is all this Kimball needs

I've let it go, I've let it go

Counting all the moments
Of the loves I've left behind
Crying on the shoulders of the days

Like the battles of the soldiers
Left displaced of time

Without hands to give the time of day
For love at all

I see no reason for a fall

When love still had the power
To reach inside this clock
Where my hands held a dream
The innocence of passion
And the words of Saint Teresa chiming in 
And I recall the faith
Of the love of my life
And the losing of my hands
Which he took with him when he died

When you think you've lost your mind
It is bitter as persimmons
Yet sweet of rose on vine

It's the thorns upon the vines
That sometimes tear two hearts entwined
It's a gentle breath upon your cheek
That is so truly something fine

Oh, love is something truly fine
Love is love and truly blind
Love is only human kind
Love is something truly fine

Oh, love is something truly fine
Something never looked to find
Yet truly something fine

Now you and I are roses
Chose to wither on the vines
With you, you're back to love
With me, I've run from mine

We are some kind of weather
You're the storm blown 'cross my life
I am a leaf of autumn
A fallen tear of something fine

Oh, love is something truly fine
Love is love and truly blind
Love is only human kind
Love is something truly fine

Love is something truly fine
Something never looked to find
Yet truly something fine

From the shallows of the Mekong
To my Liffey, Dublin's wine
The tide turned me around
And brought the taste of something fine

And something's truly lost
As I'll not try to change your mind
The thorns of taking chances
Made it something truly fine

Oh, love is something truly fine
Love is love and truly blind
Love is only human kind
Love is something truly fine

Something never looked to find
Yet truly something fine

In fact, that was how they met
He was a Yorkshire man in Cambridge
She was from Massachusetts

They spoke and they fell in love
They kissed and picked daffodils
She came across the ocean
Just to bid her heart goodbye

The hawk next to his goddess
They were glorious to see
Back when Ted loved Sylvia

Close friends disapproved
Said they ought to wait
They did not care with all that said
And married none the less

They traveled and they taught
A life of academia
Typewriters and cocktails
Angry verses and sad pleas

Dutiful wife and mother
The poet behind her man
Back when Ted loved Sylvia

The tempests that were howling
And tearing them apart
Were forces that had been in place
To wreck them from the start

So she stayed home with the kids
Collecting poems in a jar
He had his lectures and soon a mistress
And left her all alone

Why did she end it all?
Was he just to blame?
There's only two that know for sure
And neither one remain

I prefer to read between the lines

You were beautiful upon the keys
The world was beautiful when the two of you were dancing

Selling books outside the Metripole?
Books to read in English, books of light and sorrows
Of this foreign land and they are gone and they've flown away

Where are all the cyclos
With their drivers pedaling grace?
Crowded out by motorbike, confined to lesser space
In old Hanoi and they grew wings and they've flown away

And in the words of Graham Greene
Like the Quiet American
Who's searching these sacred streets
For old Hanoi

And in all of these sacred things
That I've been blessed in life to see
I believe I'm in someone?s dream
In history

Where is the eloquence
Of the ladies on their bicycles?
Dressed in their au dias in the lotus flowered nights
Of Indochine and they rode to progress and they've flown away

And in the words of Graham Greene

Who's searching these sacred streets
For old Hanoi, old Hanoi, old Hanoi

Nanci Griffith,"We don't live on easy street
But it's home
Looking out on the open road
Where you'll go it alone

To the last of our simple days
We'll wave goodbye
And down this road we've grown
And it's our very own

This is not a one-horse town
And we're not alone
It's somewhere off the beaten path
And we're loyal to the bone

Everybody's got their place
And got their role to play
We should never change our rules
'Cause it's our very own

Youth is but a breath in time
It's a cruise around the square
You swore you'd never be your folks
And suddenly you're there

You think you'll choose a different road
Than the one that you've been shown
But in the end we're in that square
And it's our very own

We don't live on easy street
But it's home
Looking out on that open road
Where you'll go it alone

To the last of our simple days
We'll wave goodbye
Down this road we've grown
And it's our very own

We'll recall our simple days
And we'll always know
They were our very own

Nanci Griffith,"I'll never fall in love again
It's such a contradiction
To lose all control and common sense
And even intuition
You came along, with a strange new song
And the sweetest innovation
And you said, ""One should never fall in love
But rise to the occasion""
To have loved and lost, I know the cost
I fell and almost drowned
If not for you, I'd have missed this view
From higher ground
Now we can touch the sky above
At the Angel's invitation
And we don't even have to fall in love
Just rise to the occasion
Love should be pure and free
A smiling inspiration
And one should never fall in love
But rise to the occasion",Rise to the Occasion,2004

I want a simple life
Like my mother
One true love for my older years
I don't want your wars
To take my children
I want a simple life... while I'm here

The sun and moon walk hand in hand together
Trading places shining on the truth
The moon moves the bottoms of the oceans
So, the sun can bring a farmer's hands to you

[Chorus:]

We all seek comfort in the light of day
And our tears can wash off in the rain
Everything we need is all around us

Whispering her thoughts
So the paths we choose to cross
Walk one more day

All the days we've been apart
Add up to a bunch of nothing
If I'm not still in your heart
I never want you to be
Just a page in my history
Someone I used to love

Your voice breathed in my ear
Or on the telephone
All the tender things we've whispered
To keep from feeling alone
May they never come to be
Just cold gems set in memory
Of someone I used to love

This current flows between us
That will not be denied
You draw me in towards you
Like the moon pulls at the tide
May no shadow ever fall
That will make me have to call
You someone I used to love

Could not get across
And you became my inspiration

He wore when he was with her
All he needs are his railroad boots
And his leather jacket

As he says goodbye to Ruby's arms
Although his heart is breaking
He will steal away out through her blinds
For soon she will be waking

Morning light has washed her face
And everything is turning blue now
She holds on to her pillow case
There's nothing he can do now

As he says goodbye to Ruby's arms
He says, she'll find another soldier
And he swears to God by Christmastime
There'll be someone else to hold her

The only thing he is taking is
The scarf off of her clothesline
He'll hurry past her chest of drawers
And her broken wind chimes

As he says goodbye, he says goodbye
Goodbye to Ruby's arms

He will feel his way down her darkened hall
And out into the morning
The hobos in the freight yards
Have kept their fires burning

And Jesus Christ, this cold hard rain
Won't someone put him on his train
He'll never kiss her lips again
Or break her heart

It seems it was all mapped out
All the twists and turns

Trying to find that rhyme
Still rolling with the river
Trying to keep time

Nanci Griffith,"You walked the line
All your life
You never thought you'd have to change it
You're always there to give advice
You never thought you'd have to take it

It's still life, but it's broken
It's still life, when it's torn
It's still life that you're walking
On and on and on and on and on

You need to change
You don't know how
Your life could use a reformation
If you could see you
As I see you now
I know you'd change the situation

It's still life, when it's torn
It's still life that you're walking
On and on and on and on and on

It's always someone else's fault
You're always right, you're never wrong
You think that life's a game
But this is real
You think you can just walk away
And leave destruction in your wake
But you're not walking anywhere near

Is still life if you are drowning
Is there still life when you fall
Is it still life when you can't carry
on and on and on and on and on

Nanci Griffith,"This house is full of memories that aren?t mine
Pieces I thought I would clear out over time
Life takes over, I get ahead of myself, and I turn around
And I?ve filled up the shelf
With things I don?t need that wear me down
Things I don?t want but still keep around.
I woke up today and I made up my mind
From now on I?ll Leave all those things I don?t need behind

The one thing that?s not on the shelf
Is my heart since it fell
Picking it up is a thing that I never have done well
True love always seems to fly by me.
I wonder if it?s one of those things I don?t need

Like a bag you unpack at the end of a trip
You?re wondering why did I take all of this?
These things I don?t need, weigh me down
I woke up today and I made up my mind
From now on I?ll Leave all those things I don?t need behind

Nanci Griffith,"You ran up against the rain
Everyday of your short life
Suffered for your muse without complaining
Never heard you swear life isn't fair
But it doesn't make it right
You left the world knowing all too well what pain is.

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain.

You listen to the songs
And then you wrote your own
Somewhere along the way
You passed the muse along
I feel your presence in this room
Beneath the wailing moon
It's good to know that dying couldn't tame you

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain.

Last night the weather turned
This morning we had snow
Today they'll lay you in the ground
Someday we'll all know
Where it is we go
My tears will say goodbye
While the rain is coming down

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell

Of the blue bird as she sings

But six rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up sleepy Jean

Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen

As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, our good times start and end

And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere

A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Oh, oh, oh, summer wine
          
Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Oh, summer wine
          
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with the unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me, more summer wine
Whoa, whoa, oh, summer wine
          
Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Mm, summer wine
          
When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me craving for, more summer wine
Oh, oh, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off those silver spurs, help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine
Oh, oh, summer wine",Summerwine,1998
Nancy Cartwright,"I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself

There I go, here I go, where I go, I don't know
I just can't help myself, so
Why do I do, what I do, when I do
Well, I can say so or I just don't know

Boys will be boys and what they usually say
That's the how and the why, that I act this way
That's the end of the line, I run out of rhyme
That ain't no crime so it's milk it out time

Let's see, I know it's some cosmic force
Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess
Well, ha, I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A very great lady, once said it right
A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but
I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health
What's the hey, I can't help me

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Nancy Gilliland,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Nancy Griffith,"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love
I'm sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing?

There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Maybe silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be owning

Oh, I might be gone a long ol' time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing?

How can, how can you ask me again?
Well it only brings me sorrow
Oh, the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailing
Saying, I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling

If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roaming
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're going

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of stormy weather
And yes, there is something you can send back to me

Nancy Griffith,"Baby, I know that we've got trouble in the fields
When the bankers swarm like locusts they're turning away our yields
Our dreams roll by our silo, silver in the rain
And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

Have you sees the folks in line downtown at the station?
They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil, no
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

End it all and let her go to some better man;
