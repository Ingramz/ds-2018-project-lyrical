Mustang,"Refrain :
Pia, pia pia pia (2 fois)
Bla, bla bla bla
Pia, pia pia pia
Ta gueule
Ferme-la
Pia, pia pia pia

Tu dis que des conneries
Tu crois connaître le sens de la vie
Mais les ah-hun et les oui-oui
Que t’adressent tes amis
Ne doivent pas te tromper ils ne t’écoutent pas parler
Pia, pia pia pia

(Refrain)

Au lycée à la pause de midi
Entre l’entrée et les raviolis
T’emmerdais déjà Cerise et Nathalie
Tu r’faisais tes cours de philosophie
« Descartes est un gros abruti, ce con de Nietzsche n’a rien compris »

(Refrain)

Quand au milieu de tes amis
Un nouveau venu s’introduit
Tu te fais toi-même un défi
De lui raconter toutes tes théories
Le pauvre mec est harponné, il ne pourra pas t’échapper
Bla, bla bla bla

(Refrain)

Et les braves qui veulent aller dans ton lit
Doivent apprendre par coeur ta biographie
Alors seulement ils sont admis
Et sortent prudemment leur zizi
Et si tu parles, tu parles au lit autant qu’tu parles dans la vie
Je plais le gars
Aaaaaah",Pia Pia Pia,
Mustang,"J’ai de bons parents
De bonnes manières
Je sais faire un bœuf bourguignon

Mais qui peut me dire 
A quoi ça sert 
Ca ne rapportera jamais un rond

Je n’ai pas le sens des affaires
Et dans le monde où nous vivons

C’est pire qu’une tare
Qu’un bec de lièvre
C’est pire que le cancer du poumon

Non je n’ai pas le sens des affaires
Je suis pas dans leur giron
Sur leur carte routière
Chez moi personne ne fait de pognon
Ca fait des générations
Il n’y a rien à faire

Dieu quel malheur
Dieu quelle misère
Je ne serai jamais champion

Entrepreneurs
Propriétaires
J’vous tire mon chapeau je vous tends l’oignon

Non je n’ai pas le sens des affaires
Mais j’connais leur direction
Droit dans mon derrière
Allez mettez-la moi bien profond
Car je le mérite au fond
Je suis volontaire

Je vaux moins qu’une pute
Son sexe est  tarifé
Moi on me culbute
En toute gratuité

Mustard Plug,"Close my eyes but I can't shake my head.
Still not over those words you said,
Tossin' and turnin' rolling in the night.
She's tying knots, seems that nothing is right.
Sweat on my brow, my adrenaline's flowing,
Eyes burning red, my anxiety's growing.
As soon as I'm asleep, it will be tomorrow,
And that just fills my head full of sorrow.

Insomnia's got the best of me,
I've got no choice but to stare at the ceiling.
Insomnia has a hold on me,
You don't even know the stress I'm feeling.

Clock on the wall's moving faster and faster,
Your voice in my mind like a broken record.
Tossing and turning, rolling in the night.
She's tying knots, seems that nothing is right.
Feeling my heart, pounding like a drum,
Reminding me again that my day was too long.
Drank all my wine that my cuboard is bare,
Still no escape from this waking nightmare.",Insomnia,1994

Oh Mr. Smiley,
how could it be true,
the things they say that they knew?
I can't believe it! What has happened to you?
I took my time while thinking it through.
Digging through facts, believing in you.
Oh Mr. Smiley. Give me a clue,
why they said it was you,
I can't accept it! Tell me it's not true.
Because you were once so good to me,
oh Mr. Smiley tell me how it could be.

You always had a smile on your face,
I never thought you'd become a criminal case.
Until I saw your face on my TV.
Was it just for entertainment?
Because now you face solitary confinement, in jail.

Why can't you see I need to find this place to go?

The wrong way
The right time
You know it
It'll be fine

I've spent my life trying to find, to open up what's deep inside
To find the truth to what I know

Mustard Plug,"What were you thinking when you took all these lives in your hand
What were you doing, was your death considered in your plans
You took so many, You took so many with you on your way
You even took our friend, but those you left now face the day

I wasn't like you
I wasn't like you
I wasn't like you
I wasn't like you

What were you planning when you took them on your path across the land
What were you doing, when you had them eating from your hands

Mustard Plug,"We were talking, just the other day
About small time things how we love to play
But the talk soon drifted to the darker things in life
And you mentioned, how your world had changed
When you found out how my worlds arranged
Well I guess my sin is not knowing when to lie

'Cause I'll never be, never be, what you want me to be
I'll never see, never see what you want me to see
And I know now, it's all just lost in your eyes
No I'll never be, never be what you want me to be
Never see, never see, what you want me to see
And I know now it's all just lost in your eyes
In your lies

I saw a picture of you and me
And it all rushed back how it used to be
All those feelings that were gospel such a long time ago
And I thought to myself that I wanted you back
But I know in my mind that it's only a trap
Well I guess those feelings are better just left alone

But I know, when it comes down to it I guess it doesn't really matter

And you can't do any more

You never told me

You never told me

And I know that things have changed
As I know they always do
And I know we're not the same

Why you were never around
You never told me
Why you were so popular in town

That the damage is done
That you wasted my time
While you were out having fun
But that's alright
'Cause I'll just wait and see
That you realize
You never told me

But you left me every sign
So obvious for all to see
But I turned and looked away
'Cause I could not bare the thought
So I shifted all the blame
So it didn't hurt so much
Now the weight is crushing me
I've got to rise and push it off

You never told me
Why you left and went away

Mustard Plug,"Lolita,
I wanna meet ya
I wanna take you in my arms and squeeze ya,
'cause you amaze me,
Ya really slay me
And every touch just drives me crazy.

But the world won't accept the way I feel,
And the man says that our love ain't real.
If only our love, they could only see,
But today our love can never be.

Every time that we're together
I get the feeling that its never been better
Your love just blows me away.
Tell me that you're thinkin' of me
And that you put no one else above me,
I need ya baby right now!

Since I met ya,
Girl you know I could never forget ya.
And I know now,
I'm making my vow,
That we're gunna be together somehow.



",Lolita [#],1998
Mustard Plug,"When I see you
And I know you don't see me
I try to imagine how it must be now
To walk this world alone
To walk this world alone
To carry on and do it on your own

With everybody working and everybody trying
With your hands in the air while their lying
Everybody's doing their best and realizing
As we watch we see you falling further
The world's in custody for your murder
Is there any hope for you
Is there anything we can do

I look to see
Is the world's catching up to me
Would someone give me something to help me to believe
That you won't be left alone
That you won't be left alone
To carry on and do it on your own

You're making moves
You're making plans
Progress is in you hands
It's not your fault that nobody understands
The pains you feel
They are for real
They slow you down
And re-appear
Just as soon as you
Walk away from here



",Away From Here,1999
Mustard Plug,"I think there's something, you should know
Time to hit the road, find the door, yeah ya gotta go
'cause I been down this road now a million times
I've heard every one of your bullshit lines
If ya think I'm gunna listen just one more time
You got a problem now!

For all I've said
And all I've done
You'll never be
No you'll never be the one

You've come back, said ya mend't your ways
Your dimestore smile don't hide what you betray

Mustasch,"Wicked rules been trying to putting you
From where you're sitting
You had it all, but then these voices call
With something missing

They don't seem to understand
You're not from a foreign land
Catch the drift, don't talk so loud
And then it maybe fits in

I feel I could crawl up insanity walls

Slowing down, that's not the kind I am
I like to speeding
Fences high, so you can move around
That's not my feeling

I feel I could crawl up insanity walls

Listen up, these things just had to stop
I'm turning evil
They grind me down, and try to shove me up
You hear me screaming

I don't like the quiet room
I am not some stupid loon
Wicked rules, has pulled me back for good
And here I'm sitting

I feel I could crawl up insanity walls

Where's the catch, don't mind, just sign
Get on the stage and do the show

You won't get a second chance
Turn the limelight on
Most certainly the fools will start to dance...

...Into the arena
We're drifting into the arena

I'll have to put this to an end
A perfect stranger telling me
That he's my one and only friend

I turn away and try to run
Exit's out, and here I stand
With nothing else but my two hands

Once you have passed the door
No one escape these walls
Sit back, enjoy them fall
Release the dogs...

Finally my voice is coming through
I know what I do, and I do what I have to do

Sweet birdie fly
To the nest where the others hide
Little mother cry

It's all there in what you dream
And what we saw ain't magic seeds at all

The only thing that I've been told
And what we hold is closer to the fall

Catch the mystery, catch the myth
Try to figure out why we stand tall
What you see is what you need
Is why we bleed there's nothing more at all

Of a pen or even ten line
Of mine 

The problems are the same
But don't blame me because I see
That part of reality
That pains
And stains the heart
I came into this life
With neither guns or knives
I made no laws
With all its flaws
About black and white
And whats wrong from whats right
I speak I write of what I see
Of men holdin' men in slavery
Of color class and greed

So don't blame me if wen I speak
You do feel weak
I did not create
Tell me this now
Would u accuse me of causin' a riot
If I was
Quiet

Mutabor,"In Berlin mal wieder alles grau 
 Und keinen Stoff,und keine Frau 
 Draußen Regen,drinnen kalt 
 Und nichts zu rauchen,und keinen Halt 
 Was macht man in so einem Moment 
 Man leckt sich die Zähne und öffnet sich das Hemd 
 man greift sich an die eigene Brust 
 Und denkt daran,ich muß,und denkt daran,ich muß 
 Mal wieder nach Amsterdam fahr'n 
 Mal einfach so über'n Damm karr'n 
 Schwarzen grünen gelben weißen 
 Ich hoff',das Geld reicht noch fur was zu beißen 
 Ich hoff',das Geld reicht noch für was zu beißen 
 Und ist man dann erstmal da 
 Mit leerem Magen und wirrem Haar 
 Dann packt es Dich an Deinem Schopf 
 Es setzt sich fest I'm Kopf,es setzt sich fest I'm Kopf 
 Und wenn ich dann einen dreh' 
 Schmeckt noch viel besser der Kaffee 
 Alle Knoten ham' sich aufgelöst 
 Meine Seelen sind entblößt, meine Seelen sind entblößt 
 Und ich werde wieder nach Amsterdam fahr'n",Amsterdam,1997

Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga hard
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga everytime I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-Skypage, when you wanna see me
Cause I can be your man
And, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy

Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya
Can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
9 Times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block 'cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holler if you understand my plan, ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tounge kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker, til his hearts warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just 'cause we bone, don't mean you own me, nigga, I'm grown

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waiting for you
Until you get through

I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspecious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B
Fetti over something, that's tellin' me don't run the streets

So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in
'Cause I'm dressed like a thug, until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love
And let me run the streets

On the go is how we survive
We don't know when it's goodbye

It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please

Put two in the air if you feel like me
Someone who cares feels so freaky
In demand by all the ladies

Love-sick calls, that's what I get
I hear his voice and things get wet
Knows what I want, then he'll fetch
He's my boo and I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next, he's my baby

Shaken by a dream I had when I was in danger of losin' you
And I made up my mind
I was gonna tell you when you opened your eyes I thought it through

Wanna be someone
Better than the one who wasn't there when you needed her
Someone who
Wants you, needs you, someone who'd never leave you

My almost was not enough
Never sacrificed too much
I'm ready to give
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

(Moooore)

'Cause I was so busy driving
I didn't see the road ahead or where I was going, ignored the signs
Why didn't somebody tell me
The one that I was looking for was there all the time - I was blind

It took a bad dream to show me
Without you there how it would be I realized
I want you, I need you
And baby I'll never leave you

[Chorus]

I'm willing as I'll ever be
Do anything, just watch me
I love you, I admit
More than just a little bit (just a little bit)

When you wake up
I'll be different
I don't know how I'm gonna find the right words to say
I'll have a whole lot more to give than I did yesterday (just a little bit)

You can take it any way you want to
It may not be much
But it's my song

""We need to stop the car, pull over
'Cause I really need to get some air""

And I know he made a blind man see but
Can he do it the other way round?""

That was my mistake


When I told you to go

Cause I just didn't know

That was my mistake

I thought that I was doing fine

I'm so hard on myself


I broke everything I built

And now I'm living with the guilt

At least I have my health

And brought a tear to your eye

That was my mistake


When I told you to go

Cause I just didn't know

Life will change the plans we've made

If we face the truth and be our best

MxPx,"In a room without a window, your head starts caving in
Your mind takes you to places that it's never been
In a house without a hallway there's nothing more to see
Four walls full of pickup sticks and atrophy

Where the sun shines bright and I don't have to lock my door
Where the moon is full and I'm not tired anymore

Where angels carry me along the way
Where I can close my eyes at night and pray
Where angels sit and watch me while I look up to the sky
Where angels carry me along the way

In a grave without a body, the worms lay all alone
This room is a tomb, it is my home
In a song without a meaning, your mind starts going blank
Send in reinforcements, we need a tank

Where the sun shines bright and I don't have to lock my door
Where the moon is full and I'm not tired anymore

Where angels carry me along the way
Where I can close my eyes at night and pray
Where angels sit and watch me while I look up to the sky
Where angels carry me along the way

Spread your wings around me, take me high into the air
Free prisoners from shackles, teach them they should not despair
In time we all will know our destination, which way we will go

Where I can close my eyes at night and pray
Where angels sit and watch me while I look up to the sky
Where angels carry me along the way

Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what You're doing to me?

I have spent all my years in believing You
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody, oh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home
My hard earned pay all on my own

I get down on my knees and I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
Somebody, oh somebody
Can anybody find me

He works hard, everyday I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense, got nobody left to believe in

At every hour goes the tick-tock bang of monitors as
They stared us down when we met in the emergency room
And in our beds, I could hear you breathe with help from cold machines

Every hour, on the hour, they drew blood

Well I felt I couldn't take, another day inside this place
From silent dreams we never wake, and in this promise that we'll make
Starless eyes for heaven's sake, but I hear you anyway
Well I thought I heard you
Say I like you, we can get out
We don't have to stay, stay inside this place

Someday, this day, we kept falling down
Someday, this day, set the ferris wheel ablaze
You left my heart an open wound
And I love you for

This day, someday we kept falling
One day, this day all we had to keep us safe
And if we never sleep again, it would never end

My Chemical Romance,"When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.

He said, son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned
He said will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, son when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears
Disappointed faces of your peers
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I! don't! care!

My Chemical Romance,"They're
Selling postcards
Of the hanging
They're painting
The passports brown
The beauty parlor
Is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes
The blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied
To the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad
They're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady
And I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella
She seems so easy
""It takes one to know one""
She smiles
And puts her hands
In her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo
He's moaning
""You Belong to Me I Believe""
And someone says
""You're in the wrong place
My friend
You better leave""
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken
All her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan
He's dressing
He's getting ready
For the show
He's going
To the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia
She's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid

To her death
Is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes
Are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein
Disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend
A jealous monk
He looked
So immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off
Sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you
Would not think
To look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing
The electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge
Of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps
The cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play
On penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean
Your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street
They've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready
For the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him
With self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the Phantom's
Shouting to skinny girls
""Get Outta Here
If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being
Punished for going
To Desolation Row""

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see
That nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which Side Are You On?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

Yes,
I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them

My Darkest Days,"September seventh and she's heading for school
She'll probably leave me, for some college fool
And I know, that's just the way it goes

In funny old place under the street light
Face to face, here on our last night
You should know, one thing before you go

I tell her, we've gone too far to give up now
And like a bomb, it all comes out (I like the way that..)
She looks at me like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
She makes me feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done

By the twenty-seventh she's been gone for weeks
I'm terrified she won't remember me
And I know, that's just the way it goes

I stare at her picture, stuck up on the fridge
Face to face with the one I miss
I'm alone, and reaching for the phone

To tell her, we've gone too far to give up now
And like a bomb, it all comes out (I like the way that..)
She looks at me like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
She makes me feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done

And I wanna make her feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
And I wanna make her feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done

Back from the city standing in the rain
Asked if she'd be going back again
She said no, this time I'm staying home

She looks at me like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
She makes me feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
And I wanna make her feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
And I wanna make her feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done

My Darkest Days,"Here’s an invitation to come with me
The destination’s gonna set us free
Find the place where we both belong
When the world awakes we’ll be as good as gone

Don’t need a pill I can swallow
Don’t need a road map to follow
When you’re rolling stoned
Burning up the open road
Nothing every night we go
One step over the edge
One step over the edge

In our own oasis in the desert sand
We’ll celebrate a beautiful romance
When we’re together nothing good goes wrong
We can stay forever
We can just move on

Don’t need a pill I can swallow
Don’t need a road map to follow
When you’re rolling stoned
Burning up the open road
Nothing every night we go
One step over the edge
One step over the edge

Rolling in town
Four wheel barrow
Riding all night
Rolling stoned
A little too high
But never too low
Riding all night
Rolling stoned

The world will never find us
'Cause we’ll cover our tracks
We’ll just keep on driving
And we’ll never look back

When you’re rolling stoned
Burning up the open road
Nothing every night we go
One step over the edge
One step over the edge

Rolling in town
Four wheel barrow
Riding all night
Rolling stoned
A little too high
But never too low
Riding all night
Rolling stoned",Rolling Stoned [*],2012

All a man hath will he give for life?
For life that's lost bleeds all over me.
I'd fallen before but it never hurt like this.

Great ones?

When I was young the sun did burn my face.

I let its love and warmth wash over me.
The melting voice of many, in the hush of night.
Whispering tongues can poison my honest truth.
Come dress me with your body, and comfort me.

I dreamt of a dead child in my sleep.
I wear a terrible mark in my head. my clean, white bed.
It calls to me.
I must lie down. and I want you to lay with me, in sympathy.

No! Jesus Christ. Who's my saviour?
Lose myself in gods death.

Let me show you all my pain.
Sardonyx lays waste to your eyes 
And leaves you blind.
Gone is the day.
They that did feed, delicately.
Feed on me.
The call has come, from bird and beast.
Insect and serpent, and all that lives in the sea.
And cities of fire, rip through me.

If I live you will be sorry.
I have a thousand forms.
Uninjured by your tongue.

Is the girl herself.
Elaborate, scented coiffers.

Heaven pours from her throat, 
As she sings and as she dances.
The fumes of rich swine, 
Honeyglazed and dripping, playing in the air.
My mouth eager and wishing.
But I return to this nightingale.
Her hair all fiery red.
Deep it is and wild.
My weakness will be fed.
Boys whipped on the alter of diana, 
Sometimes until they died.
The cunning wily merchant, 
And his four crippled horses.
Tales told in warlike manner.
The storyteller by the fire .
While musing deeply on this sight, 
The songster stirred my desire.
You are sweet and fine to listen to.
Long tresses about her neck.
Yet much is false.
This mighty evening, I've seen no face.
This is crushing me.
My quill it aches.
Turn loose the swans

My Dying Bride,"Your bloodied body is what I cling to.
In powerful rain, they laid their heads to die.
Let your dark, thirsty eyes drink deep the sights of me.
It's sad that, in our blindness, 
We gather thorns for flowers.
Your river holds a feast of danger.
The suffering you have had to bear.
I'd die for that moment one more time.
The loved one falls below your ideals.
Pleasure too safely enjoyed lacks zest.
The brave lick their sickening lips.

My Dying Bride,"And me kissing Christ, with one eye on his crown
I came killing through the dark
My victims, please take a bow
With great thought, my words are launched
Right into the baying crowd

The lies drop off my tongue
As I wept before the fight
There is no help in heaven
Waste me unto your rotten kin
Your words are those very thorns
Your last lie still fresh on your lips

My Dying Bride,"He surely sails on tameless seas
With idle hours in devils hands
One hundred men on tameless seas
Always searching for sacred land

Rain lashing raw shoulders
So heave, onwards, and heave again!
With wrists bangled in scars again

From below, she watched only him
Secretly, she watched only him
Stowaway, she crept so grim

He surely sails enchanted seas
Hearing voices he believes

Hail Odysseus, come to us
So heave onwards and heave toward us
With wrists bangled with gold and stars

And from below she screams out ‘No! Odysseus, please don’t go’!
And you must fear the voice you hear
Already now, they’re so near
‘And you will fall at the sirens call, into their poisoned claws!’

Fearing loss she watched them go
The sirens, she thought, take me
From below, she leapt into the sea

From the sea to the land, greeting her, a golden hand
‘Welcome child, to our isle, become one, take my hand’
So it was, a new voice sung aloud from the sand

‘So now sing, lure them in, Odysseus can be your king
The only way to love him, dear child, is to sing them in’

And so it was, the crew were lost, even brave Odysseus
Into her arms forevermore, she sings no longer on the shore",Hail Odysseus,2012
My Dying Bride,"I drank the meaning of her words, as theft
She danced for Chopin, but his request was that she left
The sea gave up his daughter for the moon
So weary she looked, as my arm lifts at noon

The fate of you and the world hung on his lonely choice
I cannot, but I would love to bury the dead again
Reward and punishment are the walls of a city bare

And it is within you comfort I show the mirror
A panic of rich desire leaps up from your burning face
The face that shows your eyes was my sole victim tonight

It’s for you, Christ, that my bodies’ here
You’re bold with your anger and your love is shrewd

He is quick so beware
The cold pool waits just for you
Pierced to the soul by heavens blade of dire shadows
Where she speaks with her lord
Her maker sits all alone
Deeds are fruit, words are leaves
Long shadows cast by old sins

She spoke of Christ to the deaf and the poor
The woman of fatalism is here now
Her heart creeps among shadows of sick children
The dying, graceful snow breaks her simple back",Kneel till Doomsday,2012
My Dying Bride,"I reach for my shadow in horror
Envy eats but its own cold heart
Some friends, the few I have left
Set sail out of the frame I’m in

He begins to die, That loses his desires
All are not merry that dance here lightly
Fear follows those who live by the sword and fire
My heart was my weapon, and the death of me

I saw the evening anew, all lean and red of hue
It’s a lonely ocean out there, watched from my shore of despair
So unto the sea my grief set sail, in disbelief
Fevers and time burn away, Nothing is allowed to stay

There is nothing new underneath the sun
The moon with its long arms, reaches into the sea
My eyes were towers high, in my heaven

And from my body drew a cold breath and final clue
The sun made clear its thoughts, It was never coming through

My Dying Bride,"I’m unaware of a response
From my errant dark red soul
Too deep to be spoken aloud
I bury a word right in my heart

Frost etched the tall windows
I have been cold for a long time
Borne upon winters shoulders

There are wolves here, many of them
I am staggered at their hatred of me

I lie in complete fear
I call the moths to tend me
I forget the form of my sins

And drained of motion, the air itself avoids me
And void of notion, unable to perceive
Mouth barely open, almost fearing to breathe
And there is no other sound at all

I always knew he was coming
Takes the vacant chair beside me
With golden hands he moved the hair from my face",A  Map of All Our Failures,2012
My Dying Bride,"Across the cedar covered river
Within the night that covers them
Up the hill toward dark gates
An approach so sweet yet again

Proffer the sightless with wine
Crank the old gramophone

To go up and dance with the blind girls
A secret so holy and dire
To waltz in the arms of innocence
Hushed delights from the choir

Shadows long and playful
Cast with broken old candles
Gowns worn and stressed
Yet graceful in tired old sandals

Strike up the scratchy old music
Tonight they won’t dance alone

Alas, the music does fade
Back to the village they creep
And leave the sanatorium
Its bars and rules, Just so",The Poorest Waltz,2012
My Dying Bride,"Twas a frosted morn in winter deep
When Rosey left for wood
The fire was low just barely a glow
When Rosey left for wood

Upon the wall a tapestry hung
A farmyard, brook and lane
A pleasant scene, Naïve theme
With wheat and hay and grain

No figures old or young
The artist did include
But now upon that landscape fair
A woman rough and crude

Each day the image differed
The woman here and there
Then close like a portrait
It was Rosey standing there

I met a maid one summers day
I thought to make my wife
On getting home, the picture red
‘Twas Rosey with a knife!

My new love I took to see
The rocks above the lake
And to my sin I pushed her in
The smile on Rosey’s face
Days did pass and I grew old
But Rosey looked the same
My bones were stiff, and hair was grey
But Rosey looked the same

Upon the bed and almost dead
She looked down on me
From the tapestry threads her hand did reach
My spirit now set free

After a time my friends did come
And were sorry to see me pale
The priest said what he thought was right
And they carried me away

My home was cleared, history sold
Empty was my place
‘Cept a picture on the wall
Of lovers in embrace",A  Tapestry Scorned,2012
My Dying Bride,"Your eyes speak more than
More than your lips
More than your mouth
Bare were your summer
Shoulders and arms
And slender neck

She rose up beautiful before me
And bare she walks the morning anew
It is the wound she gave me
Through my heart, drives her rain

Her face under the sky is full of golden sun
I drew her through the midnight sky on iron leaves

There is no name for you
You fed me wine on a tender voyage

Within your silk, I love to forget
I step around you softly
Drown away your little hatreds
Your pain is just a memory
As your summer fruit decays
My fire for you stays
Your body is a legend

I launched into her as the earth began to die
It is within her, my name is now known
The hand draws slowly back to the poor art of my eye
These are not fingers I have
Put off your air of tragedy
The art of light on your body
Falls apart in the moonlight

More than you lips
More than your mouth
Bare were your summer

I ask the meaning for us
The midnight of you, swims into sunlight
I couldn't be more obvious
A river beside, it went by them all
And ordered the words from the sea

I stumbled over hills to be with her
As the sun dropped her flesh
I gave up my tears, crawling from grief
To tell the story of her death
My faults are your reward

I took up and I might've made the people block

That I need what I don't

In comes the sun, day begun, whether I want it to or not.
I tried to run off, bury the past, leave it behind, but I got caught.
The little voice you got that won't stop egging me on.

I've done things out of desperation, become gainfully employed,
And I took this voice for granted; now it's nearly destroyed.
But at least I've got a new bed to just lie on and fade.

My Friend Steve,"Your strange fascination with the obvious
Makes you as startling as a window.
Your keen sense of being oblivious
Shows that you've nothing to hide.
From what I became, to what I'll become,
To what I once was, having seen some.
I went over the salt that's combined between us.
From up there all you see is clouds.
That might be bad.
Nothing like bliss.
After the aging's done, wonder how much I'd miss?
To live beyond the ever lessening mercies of others.
The shoulders that look our way; they scream out; try solitude.

The piss whores in the newsroom
Got a knack for starting fires.
They'll cut out your heart with a chainsaw
And shit it out over the wires.
That might be bad.

To live beyond the ever lessening mercies of others.
The shoulders that look our way; they scream out; try solitude.

Heaven help us all who understand.

Where do you stand when all of your idols have fallen?

To sink in - a waste of time, sweet time 
Why does this hand that beats me down lay trembling?
Words so unkind they send me into slavery

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1991

Its the north wind.

Wake up to the trucks outside my door,
Short of sleep.
And the sky tonight it's a deadly one,
It hardly lets us breath, 
Like Ash Wednesday.

Here come the sirens, hear them roar.
Here come the sirens, hear them roar,

And when it's hot I like the fast songs,
When I'm tired and I can't sleep,
Play them slow, way down.

So to escape I... I went back to bed

Like an old stray dog 
It won't leave you alone 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

Found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean 
From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun,

It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day

Sometimes life takes so much more than it gives 
But the One who makes the air I breathe 
Is the One who'll fix the ceiling when it starts to leak 
It may look like the end but it's only the beginning 

It's not the end

It's not the end

Sometimes I wanna stand up and fight
Sometimes it runs its course in a day
Sometimes it goes for night after night

Know that it will start off strong, babe
And it will end up weak in the end

Bet you wanna know who's on the line
Let me break it down for you one more time

My Name Is Kay,"You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out that house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I looked at my cotty, are ya out of control?

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewellery that's always on whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on
Then pop in the next 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powers

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Hey, Shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like her number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Franklins

A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my hand
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand

She's amazin', fire blazin'

Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me
Like, damn it, I know you
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

I'm spendin' my money, I'm out of control
Somebody help me she takin' my bank roll
But I'm king of the club and I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get in
Unless you were fit in
Now you're here and you don't know why 

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why 

You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

And a wild attack

And you get in your car and you drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercury's and Subaru's
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars

Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet

Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars

Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain

Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

And now he only eats guitars, get up!",Rapture,2006

Dressed in black
He speaks in a language only I can understand
His hands are warm, His breath is hot
He is the horrible pain, within my heart
My religion, My sanctuary, My church, My sacrifice, My Confession
My exorcism, My worship, in progress
I have no other lover... now, until forever
He is magic, and when He kisses me, I can taste Him on my lips
Like an elixir
Far from innocent
He is pure evil
A sinners prayer, a saints desire
For Him, I would walk through fire
For Him... I have walked through fire

To draw Him, I want so bad
One gift, I'll never have
He drives a stake into my soul
Makes me bleed, makes me whole
Drinks me, devours me, intoxicates me
With His love, Hate, Devotion, Faith
As beautiful as Jesus Christ
He is as brutal, as the depths of Hell
In my dreams, I press my mouth against His
And I feel Heaven... Horror... Terror
He looks at me with that look
I call it His serial killer look
Like He wants to fuck me, and kill me all at the same time
It scares me
It turns me on
His eyes are brown
His stare is intense... Meaningful, Powerful
Maybe that's why He's so fuckin' scary
Because He means it
Sometimes He tells me He loves me, as He looks at me
With that look
Sometimes He doesn't have to
I've never felt a man look at me like this
It's almost creepy....
Uncomfortable....
Sexy
I guess I know He could never really chop off my hands

........

Or could He?

Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'd love him till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the various sorrows
Some begged
Some borrowed
Some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night
Silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?
He was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside him
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found god and all his devils inside him
In my bed he cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon his head
So completely filled with light he was
His shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?
He had a heartful of love and devotion
He had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well I try
I do
I really try
But I just err baby
I do
I error
So come find me
My darling one
I'm down to the grounds
The very dregs
Ah here he comes
Blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of his legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?
All things move toward their end
I knew before I met him that I would lose him
I swear I made every effort to be good to him
I made every effort not to abuse him
Tattoos from his wrists to his ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?

Some got hopes and dreams
We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon

Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets

Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
Kick your balls like Pele, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling ""Ole!""

Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

Well I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, 
I'm hanging out partying with girls that never die
The C.O picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

Take me there. Let's go there
Take me to that great place with wonders and wishes
Take me there, I want to go there
Take me there. You know where
Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes

Sittin here thinkin bout yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life and dreams come true

Let's make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
'Cause you know that everything will be alright
I see the magic in your eyes
You're strong enough I know
To bring your dreams to life
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
I don't want this dream to ever go away

Now angelica's the one with all the exposure
Dil is the one who drop in the stroller
Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders
And dil cries to sleep
Til' his eyes get bleak

Chuckie get scared, chuckie says ""let's go""
If I was a rugrat, it would've been so real
Me and my twin would've been just like phil and lil

And with one wish, blink grant you one trip
Where we goin, it's an adventure, who you want to come with
See you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it's gotta be done quick
Yo chucky is scared and tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mom and dad
So take the time of day
And we'll find the place
And I guarantee that we will all get home safe

Uh uh No no no no 
You told me things of love 
You promised me treasure

And you would be all mine

And that this thing would last

You had no excuse

Why should I believe you 
When you do those things you do to me 
Why should I believe you 
When I trusted you made a fool of me 
Why should I believe you 
When I know its you, me and she 
Give me one good reason 
Why I should not leave 
We spent so many nights 
Talking about our lives 
And all the things we'd do 
Once it was me and you 
You said nothing compared 
To this love we shared 
But when I caught you it hurt 
You had no excuse

What did I ever do to make you lie to me 
(What did I ever do to make you lie to me) 
I thought the love in you'd be true and set me free

And I ain't even gon' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood
Now during sex lay there I'm have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type
But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattoos with my name on it
Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with
Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

You keep, keep on askin' me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin' in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won
You know what I'm sayin' it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 
Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin' trips to the east
Takin' shoppin' sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four
Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more, imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

[Chorus]

Every woman need a down man
Every man need a down chick
Watch your so-called friends
Watch them niggas you hang around with
I need somebody I can be serious with
I need somebody I can clown with
It's thug love and I think I found it

Will I fall
For this thug
Will I fall for a thug like you",Somebody Like Me,1999

Not like before
Yesterday, I saw your smilin' face
Love walked through, my door

One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything right
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever

Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you

I felt the sun shine so bright on me
I chased the rain from my heart
Through the storm, through the darkest night
I found my brightest star

Replace the man that waits at home for me

Telling me how he could blow my mind
Something about the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hands up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night

But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
Then you put it on me
Feelings coming on strong
I know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me

(You put it on me)

Yo, yo, yo I got so many bags of money
That they won't fit in the bank
And I'm a do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'm a make sure both y'all win

Let him keep the place you move
And I'm a pay both y'all rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
'Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge

You know literally we can go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she don't want to get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look
Chanel look mixed with the Pete Arnell look

You just stay pretty while I'm running the city
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty we living it up
I put it on your ass if you giving up

And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you can call him later
And tell him you all Jada's

Oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me

All the stars man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at em!

[Chorus: Mya]
Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner, to another, uh-huh

[Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The surpreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin on this cream
Who the hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic immunity, no time for a Visa
And just because, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin bygone be bygone, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the d-low

One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes is sore, bein the senator
Behind closed doors hittin truth to the seafloor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open more and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets

[Pras]
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, dance around these fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater and make you do a pas de bourre
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, crowd yellin !Ole!
Who the hell want to see me, from B.K., to Cali
Come on

[Chorus]

[Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finances, losin bets in the horse race
Two faced, gettin defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin out
partyin with girls that never die, the C.O.'s
pickin on the small fries, my campaign tellin lies
Was just spreadin my love, didn't know my love
was the one holdin the gun in the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

Here I am again
Back where I started from
And just when I let myself fall deep, fall hard
It seems every time I give my all
I turn around only to get slapped 
In the face with rejection
Now see this is the type of stuff 
That makes me just wanna stop
Just stop it all
Stop the giving to avoid the taking
Stop loving to avoid the hating
Stop trusting to avoid all these lies
But most of all
Stop flying to avoid the fall

You told me (you told me)
That I was your fantasy yeah (its yours)
You said that
We would practice monogamy

So, I became a freak under the sheets
Put his ass to sleep
Creeped into the kitchen
And got the remedy
Its called the lie detector
Slipped it in his drink
Brought it to his bedside and said ""take a sip of this and don't peek""

[CHORUS 1:]
You won't believe what happened when he sipped  the lie detector
Looked into his eyes 
Asked him where you been
He said ""its no surprise cause I been with my ex-girl""
Why didn't you tell me the truth
He said ""you don't want to hear the truth""

Sometimes I wish I never gave him lie detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her
So I'm kinda glad he took the lie detector
Now I know the truth so you can get the boot

Looked at her pager number
Said who's ?? sixty-nine
She said don't be surprised cause its ?? your best friend
