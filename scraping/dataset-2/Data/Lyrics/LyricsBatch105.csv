Danny Polo and His Swing Stars,"If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

A garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do

And I were the only boy",If You Were the Only Girl in the World,2005

In Your presence we're free
Oh, let us shout and dance and lift up our hands
And sing 'cause we are free, yeah

And He loves to come and fill me up
He loves to overflow my cup
He loves to come and bring His love
He loves to come and bring His touch to my heart

And He turned my weeping into laughing

Danny Ray,"Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round
Guess I'll get dressed and do the town
I'll find some crowded avenue
Though it will be empty without you

Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say ""Hello""
Couldn't think of anything to say
Since you're gone it happens every day

Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

I'll find somebody, wait and see
Who am I kiddin', only me
'Cause no one else could take your place
Guess that I am just a hopeless case

Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do

Danny Ray,"Baby it's ya prerogative what you do
I don't give a damn what he think about you
All i know is one plus one is two

Yeah it's true, you can be my boo
Tears to let out or you
All i want to do is keep in line wit you
Doin everything if it's fine with you
Lemme pick you up at a certain time
Sit and dine drink the finest wine
Ice over Cristal
Lay back peep the the scenery still and a pimp smile
In a little while
Better time and ride out
To tha finest hideout
Silver wrist and a twist
'cause the neighboorhood homes is a risk
And uh do you really want to ride wit me
Sit back and hide wit me
Conversate when you fly wit me
You don't need to be touched on
Makin love over rough zone
Playa hater get crushed on
Bumrushed on
Peep the game from a playa
Who survived in the rought streets
Collectin dust on my spot from the cops heat
Hit the block gon shop for some nice meat
I don't roll deep
Just a lil bit o care
'cause a brother want to bail to the mall
To ball wit all the blunts
Treat me right you deserve some dough
But never earn my trust
Stop trippin you can wae the bun
Sit back in the smoothe ride
Hit the block for ya homies hollarin two time
And i ain't thinkin bout ya other man
All i'm thinkin bout is ends and a tight benz
But it's right there

Danny Ray,"On the porch, on the porch
Smokin' reefa
Hm yeah

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin' at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin' like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin'
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot
And that's on

[Chorus: x2]
The front porch smoking reefa
The weed got 'em feelin' um hm
On the front porch getting deeper
Ghetto love got 'em feelin', um hm yeah yeah

In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning be	
Sippin' on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin' me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin' for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin' to talk up on the shoppin' spree
Or a be	 of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass 
and drive up my gas hittin' all the hot blocks
Bumpin' ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock y'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin' to get they props
Pollutin' the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin' up shops for lots comin' back nots
Each and everyday of the week 
the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin' heat
Bustin' flows in the cipher getting deep 
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin' crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and want to try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store 
for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks 
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back
On the

[Chorus]

One morning I
Woke up next to a chocolate fee and a red bone 
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin' I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin'
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out 
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop 
I'm hangin' by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang 
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin'
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin'
Niggas who flippin' new 98's is steady cruising 
Bumpin' up the block flossin' for the chicks cause they rich
But I ain't leavin' off the front with the blunt 
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest bitches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the B's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degrees and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin' out ""Freeze""
Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please
Tell me 'bout some ghetto love
Homies around smoking Newports 'till the brew drunk short
You can travel the world can't find a place like home 
With a crib on the front with a skunk torch

Danny Rivera,"I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin'
Someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face,
I see it's true
So tell me all about it
Tell me about the plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am supposed to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin 'for is gone

I didn't come here for cryin'
Didn't come here to breakdown
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you
When I build my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much
More than friends
And I don't wanna know the price I'm
Gonna pay for dreaming

Please come in Rugrats

Whoever gets caught got to take the blame

Rakim: Take it to the maximum

Rakim:
The trains been highjacked on track and never come back
The express, the last stop is where the funs at
I got my friends, a car full of hostages
To the destination, they'll be lots of kids
Enough said, take it full steam ahead
I give extreme direction to the team of fed
We ain't a breeze, once we hit top speed they gonna panic
But it's aerodynamic
Scream across the planet
Engines go against a airforce wind
Adrenaline, make sure the trail of force won't end
The third rail prevails
We don't pretend to spin
Next questions is when will the fun begin
What will we get there, double the kicks
Hurry up because we can get in trouble for this
Speeding the Rugrat's and them we have to come
Take it to the maximum

All in together lets make a game 
We can all win if we play the same

Keep it moving, is this the fastest this thing can go? (No) 
Did we lose them?
Speed it up we're going too slow, where's the turbo button at? (Right here 
I'ma push it)
Anymore juice that can boost the blow,
Stand back give me that, I'ma play a game
Let's see who can gain on the runaway train
Everything is real so I know I'll win
While you wish you could, I know I can
It's action pack, I was meant for this
High energy and adventurous
Look around we're going faster than the speed of sound
Anymore faster and we'll leave the ground
Day designed, outlined the curve
We zig-and-zag till we start to swerve
Speeding the Rugrat's and them we have to come

I can make you think you need me too...

Danny Schmidt,"I woke up this morning and I realized
That I owned everything -- I owned everything
I owned all the air in the world
And all the house too
And all the TVs and Landrovers
And all of Jupiter's moons
Well that's a lot to be owning

So I shared it all -- I shared it with everyone
I'm a good sharer you know -- I guess I learned that young
Shared some land over here, and some food over there
I divvied it all away, tried my best to be fair
Inevitably though, there were inequities though
I mean that certain folks got to use more of my stuff
lots more of my stuff...
Mostly rich people

Yeah I woke up this morning and I realized
That I owned everything -- everything
Ain't it funny how sometimes you just wake
Up in the morning and find that everything's changed

Like going to sleep after a really big fight
And wakin' up in the morning scared to open your eyes
But you look over there -- there she is over there
And oh my god, what the hell, something you dreamed 
must've been kinda funny to her cause she's grinning
She's just grinning at you

Or like when Kafka woke up -- woke up in the morning
And all of a sudden, without any warning
He looked in the mirror, saw his worst morning fears
Yeah Kafka -- he was a cockroach... a giant one...
a giant Czechoslovakian allegorical yucky-ass sorta
cockroach.. that must have really sucked for him

Kinda makes you scared to wake up
Wake up in the morning
When things have been going OK
And you've gotten no warning
But it all goes to show
That there's just one thing you know
You just never know

But when you wake up in the morning
And she grinning at you
And you're not a giant cockroach even
And you own everything
Don't it make you feel
Yeah don't it make you feel
Kinda lucky.",Lucky,2000
Danny Schmidt,"Things change fast
But this too shall pass
Better carve it on your forehead
Or tattoo it on your ass

'Cause who can tell
When the clock strikes twelve
If today's become tomorrow
Or if it's all just gone to hell

My friend makes rings
She swirls and sings
She's a mystic in the sense
That she's still mystified by things

But scared to ask
How can nothing last
'Cause like a cancer in your body
It all just goes too fast

We think too big
We think our self is one whole thing
And we claim that this collection
Has a name and is a being

But deep inside
When every cell divides
It sets upon the rule that states
Self-interest is divine

Cancer, too
Lives by this golden rule
That you must do unto the others
As the others unto you

All for the best
'Cause that's all the life accepts
And so we kill it like a buffalo
With awe and with respect

Don't ask God
Just ask the sky
She'll tell it to you plainly
In the clouds that whisper by

And praise the shapes
And then praise the way they change
And they'll teach you not to pray to light
Without you pray to rain

So I pray to hands
And I pray to needs
And I pray to blades of grass
To find forgiveness in the weeds

But as for health
I just never did believe
And so I never prayed myself
Except to those that prayed for me

The story goes
Or the way that I was told
There was a king that always felt too high
And then he fell too low

And so he called
All the wise men to the hall
And begged them for a gift
To end the rises and the falls

And here's the thing
They came back with a ring
It was simple and was plainly
Unbefitting of a king

Engraved in black
It had no front or back
But there were words around the band that said
Just know: This Too Shall Pass",This Too Shall Pass,2005

The soul's filled with vacancy. 
You've spoiled all the crops and seed. 
This was a birth, a gift. You daftly wasted it. 
The dust and dirt will stain your fists. 
You can't escape your own skin.

Every creation is plucked from a boundless hole of perception, 
Doomed to endure flaws of its fountain. 
The boy will one day cross the mountains.

And reunite this world's divided halves, fulfill their history. 
This is more than divine decree, it's his destiny.

So please take heed of this prophecy.
Lifetimes from now there will be two chosen, bound to meet. 
Inside her lock he will turn the key. 
Their love will be strong enough to erase all the wrong we've done, 
Return us to where we belong, with the Light and Dark as one.

One day the strands will mend. 
All the torn seams and frayed ends will turn to one single thread. 
The cycle will begin. 
The choices he made that day, to burn down what he'd helped create. 
You have made this bed, now you must sleep in it.

Every creation is plucked from a boundless hole of perception, 
Doomed to endure flaws of its fountain. 
The boy will one day cross the mountains.

And reunite this world's divided halves, fulfill their history. 
This is more than divine decree, it's his destiny.

So take heed of this prophecy. 
Lifetimes from now there will be two chosen, bound to meet. 
In her lock he'll turn the key.

Their true love will be strong enough.

To erase the wrong we've done, the Dark and Light will become one.

Their true love will be strong enough.

To erase the wrong we've done, the Dark and Light will become one. 
What a tragic mess you fools have made of this.

Time flashed by for the Dark and the Light. 
The two fragments, recessed, still left unaddressed, stranded in unrest. 
In the Dark lived two brothers, Adakias, the youngest, and the heir, Pallis. 
As children, of the lists of myths, their favorite was the narrative 
Of Holy The Sea And The Divided Terrene. 
Adakias would always dream of a destiny to leave, of fulfilling the prophecy. 
But he was laughed at, fitted with an unfavorable grafted cast for a foolish dreamer, 
A romance seeker. The streets frowned, but deep down he screamed out. 
He knew there was accuracy in the antiquated legacy. 
Legitimacy to the famed sea. A quiet certainty to his fated fantasies.",The Oracle,2008
Danny Stewart & His Islanders,"Out of the west, hands I have pressed beckon to me
Over the sea waiting for me lonely and blue
Somebody sighs, somebody cries, I love you, I love you

Drifting in dreams, drifting it seems back to the shore
Where hand in hand over the sand we'll stroll once more
Heart of my heart, we'll never part, I hear her say
But with the dawn my dreams have gone astray

I hear the voice of my land
A-callin' me it seems
Those fair Hawaiian islands
My isle of golden dreams

Danny Tenaglia,"Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimentin with all types of fuckin gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid
Atoms Shatter, and lemons start to scatter
Illusion dwellin in path for mental confusion",Elements,1998

Back there on the mucky side
Take the cage for one more ride

With old school ties and little white lies
They left our town for scrap

Now we're nursemaids, now we're cooks
Now our kids steal pension books

And the wrecking balls caress
Like vermin round a burial ground

Danny Thompson,"This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover
As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
Which caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble
Weary of traveling, he sat down to rest
By the foot of yon' mountain
Lays a clear flowing fountain
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh

With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted
With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make
But he dreamt about sighing
Lamenting and crying
Go home to your family and rambling forsake

'Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember
When first he arrived home to his family and friends
And they did stand so astounded
Surprised and dumbfounded
To see such a stranger once more in their sight

And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away
And he's as happy as those
As have thousands of riches
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away

This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover
As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
And caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

Danny Thompson,"Hush little baby, don't say a word
Pappas gonna buy you a mockingbird

If that mockingbird don't sing
Pappas gonna buy you a diamond ring

If that diamond ring turns brass
Pappas gonna buy you a lookin glass

If that lookin glass gets broke
Pappas gonna buy you billy goat

If that billy goat don't pull
Pappas gonna buy you a cart and bull

If that cart and bull turns over
Pappas gonna buy you a doggie named rover

If that dog named rover don't bark
Pappas gonna buy you a horse and cart

If that horse and cart fall down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town

Danny Thompson,"We had visions, in the night
Oh, oh, oh
I was scared and you held me tight
Oh, ohhh

It was like we were in black and white
As clear as day, as dark as night

And the truth became a lie
Oh, ohhh
There was no longer peace of mind
Just fear of the unknown, and the unkind

And then when he undressed me
And took my body
I was resolute to be fine

Now the soldiers are all on fire
And our hearts, are dead from desire

And when you say it has nothing to do
Nothing to do with you, you're a liar

Now the sky is filled with dust
Of those we loved and those we lost
Oh, ohhh

Make it last longer
Make it stronger
Give up your power",Tower Song,2010
Danny Thompson,"Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams

And the world on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

Ring them bells Saint Peter 
where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know
For it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells Sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When the innocence dies

Ring them bells Saint Catherine from the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance between right and wrong",Ring Them Bells,2012

I'm drowning in a river of my tears

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away

Danny Thompson,"Galileo fell in love as a Galilean boy, 
And he wondered what in heaven who invented such a joy.
But the question got the better of his scientific mind, 
And to his blind and dying gaze, 
He looked up high and often sighed, 
And sometimes cried, 

Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?
Someone like you and made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then.
But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
I was lonely and unhappy, 
And my lips were cold as ice.
But you kissed me, and good heavens, 
Now I'm here in paradise, 
So if ever I'm not kissing you or looking in your eyes.
I won't be blind, and I won't cry.
I'll look up high and gladly sigh, 
And thank the guy,

You were in your Sunday best
With your father's tie upon your chest

Slamming doors to hearts that fall

And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back

A ghost in a hurry to fade

Trailing this rusted wreck

Danny Thompson,"My history is no secret it's written in the stones
In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend

Danny Thompson,"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love
I'm sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing?

There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Maybe silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be owning

Oh, I might be gone a long ol' time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing?

How can, how can you ask me again?
Well it only brings me sorrow
Oh, the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailing
Saying, I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling

If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roaming
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're going

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of stormy weather
And yes, there is something you can send back to me

When the bankers swarm like locusts they're turning away our yields
Our dreams roll by our silo, silver in the rain
And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

Have you sees the folks in line downtown at the station?
They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil, no
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work these farm with sweat and tears

The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience

To comfort us hereafter all in America

Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star

It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Yeah but this time Lord you gave me a mountain, 
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer

Danny Vaughn,"There's a time when you keep all that's precious
Close to your skin
There's a face in the window
Reflects everywhere that you've been
There's a romantic notion
You're dancing to some silent song
There's a reason unknown
Why a traveler keeps moving on

I'm just a passenger
I'm just a stranger at the wheel
I'm just a messenger
And I can't explain all the things I feel

So I ride
Ride down the wind
Search for the end of the road
That you know might not ever come
Come down in time
Touch every hand that you find
With a smile and a tear in your eye
To a traveler it's always goodbye

There's a whisper of love
That we keep for our innermost prayers
Longing for destination
But somehow I've never found where
There's a whirl and a blur
Where our time and our youth always slips
There's a hope for salvation
On every traveler's lips
 
I'm just a passenger
I'm just a sailor lost at sea
I'm just a messenger
And I can't explain what's inside of me

Danny Vaughn,"If we meet in the clearing
I will hold you once again
All us road weary men will be young ones again
And I'll laugh and I'll call you my friend
There's a lifetime in your handshake
There's a fire that's still burning bright
We'll start over again and we'll laugh at our sins
When we hold ourselves up to the light
There comes a time of forgiving
To fearlessly tally your scars
Of all of the times we have lived through
Now this one is better by far

If we ever get to heaven
We will have such a gathering there
There's a dozen lost friends that I know in the end
Will have so many stories to share
And oh, but how I have missed you

And I've longed to find out how you are
Of all of the roads that we've rambled
Now this one is better by far

Better by far
When the currency of life
Is the counting of friends
Better by far
To be loving the journey
Than to live for the end

If I glance over my shoulder
I might see the steps leading me here
If I gaze at the horizon
Then the length of my travels comes clear
Sure as one foot will follow another
I will never lose sight of the stars
With all of your bright lights around me
Forever is better by far
Better by far

She's already up and gone
Miles away without a warning
Never knowing for how long

I don't think that I will forget her
For her words were hard and cruel
She once called me a pretender

And if I still had the number
Would I hesitate to call?
Would she make me feel like cryin'?
Would she make me feel so small?

There's been too many years gone by
There's been too many years gone by

How could I forget that winter
It was 10 long years ago
Blinded by the love between us
Blinded by the fallin' snow

She was everything that I needed
She was everything to me
Then the summer came and it freed her
And brought me down upon my knees

And if I still had the number
And if I had the nerve to call
Would we laugh about that winter
Would we laugh about it all?

There's been too many years gone by

I don't wanna make you
I just wanna take you down
By the cool clear water
Under the sun filled sky

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why
God alone knows why
God alone knows why

I don't want you
Well, I'm inclined to
I think you're the only fool like me

Won't you meet me down
By the cool clear water
Under the sun filled sky?

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why, oh yeah
By the the cool clear water
Under the sun filled sky

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why
God alone knows why
Knows why
God alone knows why

Yeh I can feel it in my bones

Out of reach and all alone
Can you...show me where...we did fall and break
'Cause we're losin' light
And it's gettin' late and I can't see
The place where we're together
Forever in my mind

I'm a mixed up mind in a mixed up town
Without you, uh, huh

Carryin' a torch for the one I love
It's a hell on earth with no chance for love

This close to Heaven, I was this close to Heaven
The band plays on but the tune's all wrong
I've been up all night, I've been down too long

There ain't nothin' right, there ain't nothin' cool

We're comin' to the end of the line
I gave you yesterday, but tomorrow's mine
Tomorrow's mine

I gave you everything that money, could not buy
But it never was enough, no matter how I tried

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

I would be, caught in the undertow

 I can see us on an April night
 Sipping brandy underneath the stars
 Reading poems in the candlelight
 To the strumming of guitars

 Then I'll send the servants off to bed

O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

I keep wishing I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Danny Woods,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Danny Worsnop,"Wake me up, wake me up!
I can't remember when enough was enough.
I used to be so in love
With this life I live before it was corrupt.

Take me back to the me that wanted this more than anything,
The me that said I would give up everything
Just to live one night in the life I'm questioning.

Where is the inspiration I need?
How could I hate this? I used to crave this!
I tell my stories as a form of release.
I need them just as much as they need me.

I always said I'd never waste a single second of this,
But sometimes I find myself slipping through the cracks.
How could I be such a hypocrite?

I think about it all so far
What we've been through,
Who we were, who we are.
These days the weight of the world is on my shoulders.
I never thought it would be this hard.

They come to me
To show them how they're supposed to be.
I don't want to let them down.
Lord give me the answers they seek,
The strength to give to the weak.
Give me the desire to plant the seed.
This is so much bigger than me.
I think I'm in over my head.

Jet lagged and restless and always beat down.
The rooms are full but I'm always alone.
This load is too much to carry on my own.

I always said I'd never waste a single second of this,
But sometimes I find myself slipping through the cracks.
How could I be such a hypocrite?
We hold their hearts in the palms of our hands.
I don't want to take it for granted.
I don't want to waste the gift that I've been handed.

I dig deep for what I know I need
To keep pushing forward, to keep moving!
But they expect so much from me.
I'm just a person, a human being.
I feel dead inside.
So burnt out from all I've seen.
Maybe I've gone blind
From always being in the spotlight.

I always said I'd never waste a single second of this,
But sometimes I find myself slipping through the cracks.
How could I be such a hypocrite?

Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,

When love first touched me!

Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song,1992

She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours

Danny Wright,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

In a world, few hearts survive

Where the eagles cry on a mountain high

Far from the world we know, up where the clear winds blow

Danny Wright,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she's bad he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman
I gave you everything I had
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can't ever see

When a man loves a woman
He can do no wrong
He can never own some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman",When a Man Loves a Woman,1999
Danny Wright,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Danny!,"It's crazy yo, it's like...
First my life is like a roller-coaster
Now it's like a carousel, y'know, going in circles
When will it stop

[Chorus]
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
My life is spinnin' 'round and 'round
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
I think I need to slow it down
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
My life is spinnin' 'round and 'round
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
I think I need to slow it down, down, DOWN

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo me, G' and Khary
Three the hard way
J. Nix, MK-6: take yo' pick man
Matter fact take six man, take a breather
I'll make it easy for you
This merry-go-round ain't merry at all
Danny wanna hop off this carousel
But scared he could fall
Figured I'd make a few beans with my daily routine
But if the monotony's making you scream
Then what's the ride worth?
Yo, what is my purpose?
If I could fly from this earth, I would
And gain perspective like a third eye could, but ummm
Everyday is like a rat race
Try to escape, fall flat on your face
'Cause in between the shows and the interviews
Dough and the scent of new
Hoes, centerfolds waitin' backstage in the nude
I sorta lost control
My star status got me feelin' mad exhausted yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Was interrupted in my thoughts by this shorty I used to rap to
Back when I had two at a time... I was that smooth
I ran into her at the State Fair
She told me '""we should do lunch""
I said ""fuck it"", and we just ate there
We was a great pair; we talked candidly
About the romance that we had in the past
She's gassed 'cause I'm rapping and I'm big time now
I asked how she was doing and she gave me a half-smile
Now that's wild
We made our way to the ride with the unicorns
And the moon ornaments - how appropriate
she told me it had been four years, still got no associate's
Degree, and now she's trying to cope with the debris
Of a marriage gone wrong, baby carriages on the lawn
Said she got a seed, six years old and can't read
I'm like, ""whoa, slow up your speed""
She agreed and nodded her head
Bugged me out when she said

[Chorus]

",Carousel,2006
Danny!,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Home...?,2007
Danny!,"I put my all in it
Calling it quits was a schtick
Just a ruse that I'd use
If I started to get sick of the conflict wearing away
At what we set and so I'd threaten to leave, hopin' you'd beg me to stay
And you did but this time, there ain't no coming back
Despite the fact that I don't wanna see you with somebody wack
So I guess we should just put this thing here to rest
Yes, I hate to but it's for the best
We were compatible
First date was magical
Hurts to take a sudden sabbatical
I gave you collateral
With no money down, you said my heart would suffice
Back on track three, see, you wasn't treatin' me right
A cause for concern, maximum effort but
All I got was minimal results in return
Burn ya abacus, cause this doesn't add up
Sad but, I have to know: what happened to us?

[Verse 2]
How do I move on?
And still get my groove on?
Who's gonna captivate my soul with a new song?
Who's gonna saturate my life with a new long-
Term relationship and how much longer can I wait for it?
When I know the only woman that I loved was you
Am I still in love with you?
Nah, who am I kiddin'? Give it up, we're through
They say if you care for something then set it free
If it don't come back, it wasn't meant to be
I think about the coulda-beens
And how it ended, I'm dependent on your sugar
Friends would probably want us to work it out
If word of mouth continued
They don't know the half of what we've been through
They mean well, this is my farewell
I'mma cherish the good times
If there was a good time to leave it would be now
We're just kiddin' ourselves so let's stop
If y'all ain't know I'm talkin' 'bout my one and only true love
And that's hip-hop, let's go",After the Love Has Gone,2008

Para mirar tus ojos y perderme en ellos todo el día

Confieso que extraño lo que por ti sentía

Hubo momentos que pensé que me moría
Igual nada cambiaría de aquellos grises días

He rides through the jungle tearin' limbs off a trees (Alley Oop, oop, oop-oop)
Knockin' great big monsters dead on their knees (Alley Oop, oop, oop-oop)
The cats don't bug him 'cause they know bettah (Alley Oop, oop, oop-oop)

First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
Whassup y'all niggaz all fed up 'cause I got a little cheddar
And my records movin' out the sto'?

Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted the shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"", gotta move carefully
'Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes

Yung'uns ice-grillin' me, ohh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs

Damn though mans I'm just tryin' do me
If the record's two mill' I'm just tryin' move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage

I don't want much, fuck I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggaz I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?

(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
I said, where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Yeah

And then the Fugees gon' break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for? Because I'm grubbin' more
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door

Niggaz pray and pray on my downfall
But everytime I hit the ground I bounce up like round ball
Now I don't wanna have to kill sound bar
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar

Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in ninety-six
That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz

I scramble like Randall with his
Cunning-ham but the only thing runnin' is numbers fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

(Ain't no love, in the heart of the city)
Niggaz, where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Holla at me

(Ain't no love in the heart of the city)
(Take 'em to church)
Uh, uh, uh, my nigga where's the love?
(Ain't no love, in the heart of town)
Fuck

Then Richard Pryor go and burn up, and Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit

Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin to alla y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Whatchu mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?

Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?
Nigga respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit, where's the love?

'Cause everybody is going crazy

Don’t wanna be glued to the Youtube
I ain’t paying no attention to no sick dude
Eat them people up like it's Chinese food

Ain’t no education for our little youngsters

You’re working dirty, that’s why we don’t trust ya

Now they on the talk show, ain’t really sayin' shit

Hoping in the ocean, looking for Bin Laden’s body

I think everybody in the world has lost they mind
I believe they lost something they cannot find
'Cause everybody is going crazy
And everybody is out their goddamn mind

I asked my momma what the hell is really going on
She said the world’s too cold, keep your coat on
I heard a priest tell a lie at the podium
The whole world in a state of pandemonium
Don’t wait for the answer, it ain’t coming soon
Vacate 'cause they killin' like it’s high noon
AK47 in the classroom, kids killing each other like it’s Platoon
Everybody unemployed, no education for the kids got me so annoyed
They put the money in the prison like they’re paranoid
We put the Bible down and pick up the tabloid

Nuestra flor se marchita bajo la luna
Al menos esta vez, pon tu alma
Si me vas a matar, hazlo con la verdad

Nunca me olvidé de ti, te amo hasta enloquecer
Y siento que te hice mal, debo desaparecer
Soltarte me cuesta la vida, soltarte

Y así, el dolor
Se alimenta de la luna
Al menos esta vez, muéstrame tu alma
Y si me vas a matar, tendrás que gatillar

Nunca me olvidé de ti, te amo hasta enloquecer
Y siento que te hice mal, debo desaparecer
Soltarte me cuesta la vida, soltarte",Soltar,2017

Van apilando billetes robandole a su gente

Dante Thomas,"She's a rich girl from the top of the food chain
Love and material things, kinda lonely
Til I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring
She invites me to spend a day on the jet skies
At first it didn't mean a thing
Then she told me I'm the one that she searched for
It was hard to believe.

[Chorus]
She's miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.
House down by the water, sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet
Made, from Harry Winstons place
Went horseback up to the mountain top
Shown me the land she's got,
Well its alright but something else is on your mind,
Looking past all that shines now the tears are running through
All those things are nice but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you.

There's no fun like New York City

but never made a choice 
instead I made the most of a bad situation 
but who's to say I won't, walk right out that door 
and leave the only love that I've ever known

but not the way she acts towards me 
but if I leave her will she stop me? 
or will she let me go? 
she says that she loves me 
but not the way she acts towards me 
but if I leave her will she stop me? 
or will she let me go? 

never was a time so perfect in my eyes 
that makes it easy to believe that we'll never change 
cause what does she feel if she doesn't feel love for me? 
is this a game, and am I just a playing piece? 
if anything, just let me think 
cause she loves her man 
that's what she says 

she says that she loves me 
but not the way she acts towards me 
but if I leave her will she stop me? 
or will she let me go? 
she says that she loves me

If you're open to forgiveness 
Then the heart can mend

A way through the pain 
I will set you free 
Will you come home baby? 
Come back to me

And everything is blue for him and himself
And everybody around

I gotta be strong
Deep down inside I know that we'll never be

Still the rain keeps pouring down

Così quando ti imbarazzi metti in posa e te ne vai

Non voglio mischiarmi con la brutta gente anche se butta male
Non si butta niente come il maiale (woo)
Le squadre di calcio spendono milioni
Per comprare i giocatori e pagare l'ingaggio
E pensare che io mi sento in colpa
Quando spendo troppi fantasoldi per il Fantacalcio
Faccio la differenziata, umido e secco il lunedì
Il tuo CD di plastica lo butto il giovedì
Non butto via il cash, faccio scelte sagge

Dany Brillant,"Le jour où j'l'ai rencontrée
Dans une de ces soirées
J'ai même pas pu la regarder
Tellement ses yeux me brûlaient

Alors je lui ai pris la main
Les yeux, le corps et les seins
Elle me dit, ""Fais moi du bien""
Je lui dis, ""Oui sans problème""

Dans sa chambre on est allé
Sous les draps on s'est glissé
Il a fallu m'ranimer
Dans ses yeux je m'étais noyé

Elle se serre tout contre moi
Je me crois au cinéma
Je me prends pour Cary Grant
Et puis on éteint la lampe

J'ai perdu la tête
Depuis que j'ai vu Suzette
Je perds la raison
Chaque fois que j'vois Suzon

Je ne fais que de l'embrasser
Cette fille-la me fait rêver
Elle a vraiment quelque chose
Ça lui vient sûrement des roses

Un seul de ses baisers
Peut suffire à enflammer
Le cœur de l'humanité
Ou les gars de mon quartier

Elle a un p'tit goût d'orange
De miel et de chocolat
Elle adoucit mon errance
Avant je n'existais pas

Toute la salive que j'use
Pour me donner de l'éclat
Elle a pas besoin de ça ma muse
Pour mettre le monde en émoi

L'amour et la vérité
L'ivresse et puis la beauté
Tout ce qu'en vain j'ai cherché
Dans ses yeux je l'ai trouvé

J'ai perdu la tête
Depuis que j'ai vu Suzette
Je perds la raison
Chaque fois que j'vois Suzon

Autour d'un p'tit café crème
Sur un des quais de la Seine
Dans le froid du matin blême
Un jour j'lui dirai que je l'aime

On partira tous les deux
Vers un monde merveilleux
Le ciel sera tout orange
On sera deux petits anges

Dans une chambre au sixième
Je lui dirai des poèmes
On s'aimera sans travailler
Je peux car je suis fou à lier

Elle est celle que j'attendais
Depuis qu'j'ai quinze ans passés
C'est elle que j'imaginais
Dans mon lit quand je m'ennuyais

Maintenant j'la suis partout
Plus fidèle qu'un toutou
Elle veut jamais s'arrêter
Je sens bien que j'vais craquer

Hey mambo ! Bye bye les ritournelles

Boca de piñón
Bésame con frenesí
Besarte es como comer naranjas en agosto y uvas en abril

But I really don't wanna

I must stay deep because talk is cheap

I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita

So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me is flirting it's just like sport, anything fly
It's all good, let me dump it, please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need

A little bit of Jessica, here I am

And if it looks like this then you doing it right

Elle se dévet en dansant avec grâce
Sans remarquer qu'un vieux voyeur en face...
Fait ""glot-glot"" avec sa glotte

Il n'y a plus d'place dans mes nuits
Pour le sommeil ou pour l'ennui

Elle s'endort sur mon épaule
J'ai dans les yeux ses boucles folles
Ça me fait bien loucher un peu
Mais j'aime tant ses blonds cheveux

Elle contre moi, moi tout contre elle
J'ai des fourmis un peu partout
Mais je n'boug'pas, du tout du tout

Une musique très sympathique
Pas de ronflements de dragon
Des petits plaints, des p'tits ronrons

Je n'en dors plus, la nuit, le jour
Pour un com' moi c'est trop d'amour
Ça pourrait me jouer des tours

Il faudrait bien que ça me passe
Et qu'avant elle je me lasse
De notre amour, oui mais voilà
Sûr'ment déjà j'suis chocolat

Dans ses rêves elle murmure: je t'aime
Mais elle ajoute: Mon bel Etienne!
J'suis pas très beau, j'm'appelle François
Ça m'fait tout drôle à chaque fois

Oui, mais le lendemain je n'ôse

With a dark haired girl
So if you want to hear evil
Come a little bit close

Little boy you the one
Set the world to rights
Make it tremble in fear
Do it one more time
'Cause you the one, you're the one

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one

Gonn' be hard one to tread
'Cause the night is your only love
Lots of girls gonn' be hurt
Said it's part of your fate

Celui de mourir d'un œil

Daphne Loves Derby,"We flew over the cascades
We were forced to behave while we sat in rows like children
I crossed some standard state lines
I finally found myself so far away from home

And even though New England intrigued us, thrilled us
Our bones were cold as stick and stones
We flew over the cascades
Just to find ourselves in storms we've never known

The winds were like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
And I fell down, I failed to cut its neck

Even after hours of waiting
There was no telling when the storm would find its way
The lands we tried to memorize
Were no longer wrapped in tepid shades of red

And through the night the storm held me down
And bit my neck and said it'd be okay
I stared into the fury
And the beauty of its overwhelming strength

The winds were like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
And I fell down, I failed to cut its neck

I saw a dim light in the mouth of the beast
So I followed it in, it was too late to retreat
It swallowed me whole and my flesh became meat
And I can't look back now 'cause the beast has come clean

We flew over the cascades
We're forced to behave

Oh, you've lost so many homes
You said, ""Hold on, everything will be okay""
I've been confused, why can't we just run away?

Was it hope that kept you alive through the years
And should I even call it living?

I've been dreaming that I found you staying in the sea
Then you told me that's where you've been
You said the water's cold but still warmer than your skin

",Hello Color Red,2007
Daphne Loves Derby,"Darling keep your, keep your voice low
If you can't recall your lines
Maybe they won't, they won't notice
That you're hiding the script,
Hiding the script under your sleeves

I'm sure we'll be fine
You've got your friends and I
I've got my makers and all this time

Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay
The critics say the script is old

You step away from the stage and the spotlight
I hold my breath as the curtain comes down
We must have misplaced the scene where love conquers all
It conquers all

And if I could have known on that winter day
That you'd fade away and only I was to blame
I would have stayed awake and found a way
To make every soul in the crowd stand and say
""Bittersweet and cheap! But the ending makes it strong!""

Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay
The critics say the script is old

Too late, too late to see the show
Everyone's going home
Too late, too late to make them stay

I'm desperate to know how you are
I'll be deep asleep
I've been awake for days
I'm tryin' to study
Every inch of your body
In this picture
From a distant day
When I could safely say
Nothing in this world
Could tear me down in any way
But like a dream
You disappeared
Without a sound
Without a trace

Sleep well, darlin'
Where ever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found someone to have you right

Sleep well, darlin'
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
But all I can say was goodnight

This is for a girl back home
She tore down all my walls
Left me for all she'd known
But I pushed it all away from me
And I don't know
Even if I knew
Even if I knew what to say to you
It's just to late to make you stay
I'm sick of fighting
This broken fate
If someone else gets to tell you
That you're beautiful

Sleep well, darlin'
Where ever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found someone to have you right

Sleep well, darlin'
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
But all I can say was goodnight

It's the last thing I want
But it's all that I've got
It's the last thing that I need
But it's to carry you in my heart

It's the last thing I want
But it's all that I've got
It's the last thing that I need
But it's to carry you in my heart
In my heart

Sleep well, darlin'
Where ever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found someone to have you right

Sleep well, darlin'

Now I need you more than ever

It's true, I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true, you're with this yuppie scum?
You said you'd never speak to him again

Not now
Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?
Yeah
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people's
Who said I was talking to you?
We used to have this fight each night (calm down)

But love's not a three way street

And, ""Mark's in love with his work""
Mark hides in his work

From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby

Mimi still loves you
Are you really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time

And you're running out the door
No more, I've gotta go

Dappled Cities,"I can see the fire inside
Heating the living room in no one direction
But sprawling out all over the floor

And as the smoke forms a line up to the sun
It carves a fold in everyone
And the notable promise that I can recall
Is that I could have been there with you

We'd be dancing in the fire

A tackle with a familiar response
Was my call to burn inside and alone.
Smoke rises up to the sun
And carves a fold in everyone dancing in the fire

Everyone dancing in the fire

I regret the choice that I made
That you're not a fire so I will not dance in you

Dappled Cities,"I can't know what I should say
To soothe your headaches and make your day reasonable
The constant change of folks don't stay the same
They fly by night and crawl by day

I could try the holy chord
The seeds of hay, the hay of the march
They're all the same in different ways
Like poultry games and the baptist monks
Who raised these chickens as their own personal slaves

The hee, the caw, the chain
The battery thinking chain of songs and games
Who could say what we can go changing

What cool solvent rubs away the steam stuck
To our eyes and stuck in our closets?
The same great messages that are wrapped up
In the same vain messages that always stay the same

What does it mean to take off all our clothes
And look into your eyes and say I mean it?

Dappled Cities,"To say you've heard the vision bell
Means that everything you say is what I'm looking for
The sounds you see the sights you smell
The shapes your words are forming form a necessary world
We'll keep the sun for the morning but don't tell your heart

The patterns of our words collide
To make a common sense when they are woven in our minds
Blanket thoughts so kept untold
And keeping it that way will keep us singing through our eyes
We'll keep the sun for the morning but don't tell your heart

All the same, what we're looking for is all the same
But somehow I'm still looking, oh, still listening all the same

So now you've heard the vision bell
Everything you say is what I'm looking for
The sounds you see the sights you smell
The shapes your words are forming form a necessary world
We'll keep the sun for the morning but don't tell your heart

Dappled Cities,"Time is on our side, sleep is slow
And underfoot is only the world
That chimes cued by man-time but we have a soul
So we don't need a face, we just need a home

No eyes to see the smile above the chin
And no nose to smell the breath within
And no ears beneath the receding hairline

Climb with all your ropes tied in a bow
And curdled down to the white bone
Which fray and whip till they sing and slip in the line
We don't need a face, we just need a home

She says son I'm getting all the toll, the money buys everything
Would you like a face lift?
See I didn't know I would be able to afford all of these clothes
Look at where we are
Now that's what happens when you make it

And now I can have anything I used to wish for
If I lost it all to something I would have to cry for
Oh-wow, further more I'd have to die for, oh-wow

I messed my life up and yeah I've been down
I'm a changed man now, Chris Brown
You know I feel your pain 'cause I've done and been through it
I'm Kurt Cobain but I just couldn't do it
No point in turning back just to hit rewind
Back to the future, Ma Marty McFly
Deep inside, there's a fire
'Cause I'm no longer looking at a reflection I admire
I paint the picture of a fighter, but their's someone's looking back at me and says I'm a liar

If I should die before I wake, the least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else

I made mistakes but held on to my faith

I'm free to be whatever I, 'cause I'm famous
Call me Gallagher 'cause I'm so shameless
The papers, saw the pages that are the cost of my failures
Victimized by the public, don't know if I could take it
So I sing
So when you feel like there's no more and nothing left but the life you've broken
No regrets, no turning back
Pick up yourself and tell them I'm just being me

Who’s be coming at the ill?
Fuck them, I’m a disease.
I put my money where my mouth is,
They be lying through their teeth,

I don’t raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me,
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve

Lies. You’ve been guessing out them hoes, which are bullshit,
‘cause you’ve been kissing on your balls with your small dick.
Look, I got my willy up.
And the camera’s on, but now you call me wrong on life, that’s why Harry’s on.

I shit on them, mighty freaks, they’ll never catch me on the sun bath.
‘cause no one cares about what the fuck was made in Chelsea,
The only way is the streets, don’t care what no one tells me,
Skied off, once in, two shots, none left. Ten men, one pet. Ten times there?
Pussy roll on my carpet, ‘cause the king of the jungle just tore that piece out the market,
They talking shit on the record, then why exhaust?
Doing us the dirty thing, is time to flush, ‘cause the fucking thing’s on it.
You solve it, you finish all, you dickheads be quiet,
I’m starving my face and I’m taking pussy, you on a diet.
You the type to go to Gucci? They caught up high just to try it,
They got picture, post it on Twitter and don’t even buy
You don’t hustle, you just listen to nipsy,
The only strap you only see is on the top of your kick
I go jump once before and you can even nor stinchy,
I got them on my shit back, and it wasn’t my fish,
You see my chains link to my pride if you take what comes to my life
We get our sign, not even my toilet will let shit slide
Now let that book in mine and bring that pair around with that dick
If you only see the shape of that clip, suck it, I’m your prick.

Why you staring at window when I'm the one with the pain

I used to wish on a star but nowadays I need space: satellites
See the black shades white chain, flashing lights
Never thought I could of felt this low in the highlights
So I asked Phyllis its still another day in paradise
Is the heaven for the forever twenty seven
Could it be three years till I'm jammin' with legends?
I got thousands of fans, but I don't get the obsession
There's a nice guy inside, I guess I've never met him

Cause I could buy a fast car but not even an aeroplane can seem to get me out of here
The pressure and the stress are both dying to see the end of me
And the man in the mirror is looking at me like an enemy

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Naho
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, cause

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now

I ain't afraid the good die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away

Mama always told that there's someone looking over me
Think she meant the guy with the camera tryna photo me
Be careful what you wish for, cause the truths a little different
If the guardian's my angel, why's the sun burning holes in me?
They let me loose on the public, but I didn't prepare
I get shock by a lens everytime I appear
Put a star in the room, I swear it changes the atmosphere
Cause I'm a celebrity, can someone get me out of here

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Naho
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, cause

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart (oh like everything I touch it falls apart)
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now

Take me there, take me there
Na na na I ain't scared, I ain't scared

For now your just flesh and bone
Just a little brother tryna build a home
I'll be the best till my dying breath: brian jones

We shut the whole shit down for winehouse

Dar Williams,"Words and music by Dar Williams
Have I got everything? Am I ready to go?
Is it going to be wild, is it gonna be the best time?
Or am I just a-saying so-o-o-o? Am I ready to go?
What do I hear when I say I hear the call of the road?

I think it started with driving, more speed, more deals, more
Sky, more wheels
More things to leave behind, now it`s all in a day for the
Modern mind
And I am traveling again
Calling this a ghost town, and where is the heartland?
And I`m afraid, oh, was there any good reason, that I had to go
When all I know is I can never come back. 

Traveling I made a friend, he had a trouble in his head
And all he could say`s that he knew that the bottle
Drank the woman from his bed, from his bed
He said ""I`m not gonna lose that way again.""
But sober is just like driving, more joy, more dread, someone
Turns her head
And smiles and disappears 
He`s gotta take it like it is, and it goes too fast
And he is just like me, caught in-between, no sage advisor
Does weary mean wiser? 
And someday will I sing the mountains that carried me away away
From home and hometown boys like you?

Yeah, but what about us? Was it really that bad?
Oh it`s hard to believe I want a highway roadstop
More than all the times we had, on little dirt roads
What am I reaching for that`s better than a hand to hold?
It really was about driving, not fame, not wealth,
Not driving away from myself
It`s just myself drove away from me 
And now I gotta get it back and it goes so fast, so I am traveling
Again
Sitting at the all-night, picking up a pen
And I`m afraid, oh, was there any good reason
That I had to go, when all I know is I am all alone again
And you are the ghost town, and I am the heartland
And I can say, oh, that`s a very good reason
That I had to go, but now all I know is I can never come back
And I will never go back.",Traveling Again,1994
Dar Williams,"Why is it that as we grow older and stronger
The road signs point us adrift and make us afraid
Saying ""You never can win,"" ""Watch your back,"" ""Where's your husband?""
Oh, I don't like the signs that the sign makers made.

So I'm going to steal out with my paint and brushes
I'll change the directions, I'll hit every street
It's the Tinseltown scandal, the Robin Hood vandal
She goes out and steals the king's English
And in the morning you wake up and the signs point to you

They say
""I'm so glad that you finally made it here,""
""You thought nobody cared, but I did, I could tell,""
And ""This is your year,"" and ""It always starts here,""
And oh ""You're aging well."" 

Well I know a woman with a collection of sticks
She could fight back the hundreds of voices she heard
And she could poke at the greed, she could fend off her need
And with anger she found she could pound every word.
But one voice got through, caught her up by surprise
It said, ""Don't hold us back, we're the story you tell,""
And no sooner than spoken, a spell had been broken
And the voices before her were trumpets and tympani
Violins, basses and woodwinds and cellos, singing

""We're so glad that you finally made it here
You thought nobody cared, but we did, we could tell
And now you'll dance through the days while the orchestra plays
And oh, you're aging well.""

Now when I was fifteen, oh, I knew it was over
The road to enchantment was not mine to take
'Cause lower calf, upper arm should be half what they are
I was breaking the laws that the sign makers made.

And all I could eat was the poisonous apple
And that's not a story I was meant to survive
I was all out of choices, but the woman of voices

She turned round the corner with music around her,
She gave me the language that keeps me alive, she said:

""I'm so glad that you finally made it here
With the things you know now, that only time could tell
Looking back, seeing far, landing right where we are
And oh, you're aging, oh and I am aging,
Oh, aren't we aging well?""",You're Aging Well,1995
Dar Williams,"Once upon a time there was a nuclear family,
And we lived in a family time,
And we'd unite in a family way.
And off in the ancient mountain,
They were splitting every nucleus.
They said, ""Don't be alarmed,
Just don't try this at home.""

And they were the mystery that made the world run
And we had the power, 'cause they were the sun
And we called them our heroes, and the future had come.
They said, ""Look at the light we're giving you,
And the darkness we're saving you from.""

Soon they were bringing it into our showroom,
And they'd unveil it with it's title,
Bring your family, bring your family,
It's the great unknown.
You can look, but you can't fathom,
It's the Great Unknown.

I'm no ordinary princess, 
I was born in the Cold War,
And my team is the Rockets,
Go team, it's a dangerous time
And I dream of the moon and building lunar clone colonies.
And I build my peace with strength, 
That's the best weapon you've got.
Oh, I am the brainchild, I am the mortar,
With a plastic trophy and an eating disorder,
And vision as big as a great big wall,
And they tell me that I'll move forward 
For the good of us all,
And the good of nuclear families all.

And they think I think I am important.
I know I never was, no, I wasn't.
No, I never, and how could I be?
It's the great unknown.
Now we've built it, now it's ticking,
It's the great unknown.

And I am your children, I am millions
And I wanted to sell out, I wanted to try,
But the sky got too low 
And the ocean got too high.
And I tried to take God into my own hands
Am I too late? Is it over?
Have I sacrificed my family to the great unknown?
There's a war between my conscience and the great unknown.

So I walked out into the gamma fields 
Out in Mercury, Nevada.
Where I stood in circle, 
And that circle started to pray.
And the wind at the nuclear test sites
Floats the data of the radiation.
From the underground testing,
Cross the line, you'll get arrested.
And we came from all over in a silent appeal
As the drill comes down like a presidential seal.
And we stand for the living, and we stand for the dead,
And we looked out to see your enemies,
And we see that you're looking all at us instead.

And you think I am being disruptive?
But no, I'm running home, I'm running,
'Cause I'm trying to put the atom back together.
It's the great unknown.
I'm just trying to put the atom back together.
It's the great unknown.",The Great Unknown,1995
Dar Williams,"Yea, there was a time I didn't like the love, I liked the climbers,
I was no sister then, I was running out of time and one liners,
And I was afraid, like you are when you're too young to know the time, and
So I watched the way you take your fear and hoard the horizon,
You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on,
Like you own them just because you bought the time,
And you turn to me, you say you hope Im not threatened,

Oh, I'm not that petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.

So now were at a club, you watch the woman dancing, she is drunk,
She is smiling and shes falling in a slow, descending funk,
And the whole bar is loud and proud and everybody's trying, yeah.
You play the artist, saying, ""Is it how she moves, or how she looks?""
I say, its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks,
And as long as shes got noise, shes fine.
But I could teach her how I learned to dance when the musics ended,

Oh, and thats not petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.

You tried to make me doubt, to make me guess, tried to make me feel like a little less,
Oh, I liked you when your soul was bared, I thought you knew how to be scared,
And now its amazing what you did to make me stay,
But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going,

And so Im leaving, you can find out how much better things can get,
And if it helps, Id say I feel a little worse than I did when we met,
So when you find someone else, you can try again, it might work next time,
You look out of the kitchen window and you shake your head and say low,
""If I could believe that stuff, Id say that woman has a halo,""
And I look out and say, ""Yeah, shes really blond,""
And then I go outside to join the others, I am the others,

Dar Williams,"If you're gonna get your heart broke, you better do it just right, 
It's gotta be raining, and you gotta move your stuff that night, 
And the only friend you can reach isn't a good friend at all, 
And you know when he says ""Now who dumped who?"" that you never should have made that call. 

I had the blessings, there's nobody there, there's nobody home, 
Yeah, the blessings, at the moment I was most alone 
And aimless as a fulltime fool, the joke was on me, 
I got all those birds flying off of that tree, and that's a blessing. 

And the blessings were like poets that we never find time to know, 
But when time stopped I found the place where the poets go. 
And they said, ""Here have some coffee, it's straight, black and very old,"" 
And they gave me sticks and rocks and stars and all that I could hold, 

I had the blessings, a moment of peace even when the night ends, 
Yeah, the blessings, can we meet? Can we meet again, 
At the crossroads of disaster and the imperfect smile, 
With the angel in the streetlamp that blinks on as I walk on a mile, the blessings. 

And the best ones were the ones I got to keep as I grew strong, 
And the days that opened up until my whole life could belong, 
And now I'm getting the answers, when I don't need them anymore, 
I'm finding the pictures, and I finally know what I kept them for, 
I remember, I can see them, see them smiling, see them stuck, 
See them try, I wish them luck and all the blessings. 

I was fast asleep at three in the morning when I got the payphone call, 
And she said, ""Did I wake you up,"" I said, ""Hey, no, not at all."" 
And she said, ""I got this suitcase and I don't know what to pack,"" 
And I said, ""You can take anything you want, just wait and see, 
It's not a release, not a reward, it's the blessings, 
Its the gift of what you notice more,"" 
And I walked out and I watched her kick the big pile of the night, 
And we sat down and we waited for that strange and empty light. 
Yeah the blessings

Dar Williams,"Amber called her uncle, said ""We're up here for the holiday, 
Jane and I were having Solstice, now we need a place to stay."" 
And her Christ-loving uncle watched his wife hang Mary on a tree, 
He watched his son hang candy canes all made with Red Dye No. 3. 
He told his niece, ""Its Christmas Eve, I know our life is not your style,"" 
She said, ""Christmas is like Solstice, and we miss you and its been awhile."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And just before the meal was served, hands were held and prayers were said, 
Sending hope for peace on earth to all their gods and goddesses. 

The food was great, the tree plugged in, the meal had gone without a hitch, 
Till Timmy turned to Amber and said, ""Is it true that you're a wtich?"" 
His mom jumped up and said, ""The pies are burning,"" and she hit the kitchen, 
And it was Jane who spoke, she said, ""It's true, your cousin's not a Christian,"" 
""But we love trees, we love the snow, the friends we have, the world we share, 
And you find magic from your God, and we find magic everywhere,"" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And where does magic come from? I think magic's in the learning, 
'Cause now when Christians sit with Pagans only pumpkin pies are burning. 

When Amber tried to do the dishes, her aunt said, ""Really, no, don't bother."" 
Amber's uncle saw how Amber looked like Tim and like her father. 
He thought about his brother, how they hadn't spoken in a year, 
He thought he'd call him up and say, ""It's Christmas, and your daughter's here."" 
He thought of fathers, sons and brothers, saw his own son tug his sleeve, saying, 
""Can I be a Pagan?"" Dad said, ""We'll discuss it when they leave."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table,

Like a pair of angel wings,

Dar Williams,"I threw your keys in the water, I looked back, 
They'd frozen halfway down in the ice. 
They froze up so quickly, the keys and their owners, 
Even after the anger, it all turned silent, and 
The everyday turned solitary, 
So we came to February. 

First we forgot where we'd planted those bulbs last year, 
Then we forgot that we'd planted at all, 
Then we forgot what plants are altogether, 
and I blamed you for my freezing and forgetting and 
The nights were long and cold and scary, 
Can we live through February? 

You know I think Christmas was a long red glare, 
Shot up like a warning; we gave presents without cards, 
And then the snow, 
And then the snow came, we were always out shoveling, 
And we'd drop to sleep exhausted, 
Then we'd wake up, and its snowing. 

And February was so long that it lasted into March 
And found us walking a path alone together. 
You stopped and pointed and you said, ""That's a crocus,"" 
And I said, ""What's a crocus?"" and you said, ""It's a flower,"" 
I tried to remember, but I said, ""What's a flower?"" 
You said, ""I still love you."" 

The leaves were turning as we drove to the hardware store, 
My new lover made me keys to the house, 
And when we got home, we just started chopping wood,

But the hills of Iowa make me wish that I could 
And I've never found a way to say I love you, 
But if the chance came by, oh I, I would 
But way back where I come from, 
We never mean to bother, 
We don't like to make our passions other people's concern, 
And we walk in the world of safe people, 
And at night we walk into our houses and burn.

How I long to fall just a little bit, 
To dance out of the lines and stray from the light, 
But I fear that to fall in love with you 
Is to fall from a great and gruesome height. 
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, 
Her husband had just left her, 
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said, 
""What is love, where did it get me? 
Whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Once I had everything, 
I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway 
And the words I've never felt. 
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, 
Ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and I'd do it again, 
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion, 
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see, 
You were a-wandering out on the hills of Iowa, 
And you were not thinking of me.

Dar Williams,"She never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City 
The cold comes though every crack she puts her hand up to 
The radiator's broken, so she has to use electric heat. 

And tonight was the first date with the brother of the guy she worked next to 
He lived a couple streets away 
He listened, he had things to say 
She asked him up for dinner sometime 
Sometime was tonight 

The radio gave updates on the ice storm while she made the dinner 
They said, from all the talk, you shouldn't drive or even walk 
And this just in, we're asking everyone to turn off their power 
They need it at the hospital. 

She ran around pulling plugs, then she called him up 
Maybe now they shouldn't meet, he said that he would brave the streets 
She met him at the door with a blanket and a candle
Saying, I heard it on the radio, I had to turn my power off. 

He said you're not the only one, the streets were dark tonight, 
It was like another century
With dim lamps and candles lighting up the icy trees and the clouds and a covered moon. 

She said what kind of people make a city 
Where you can't see the sky and you can't feel the ground? 

I tell you something, I have this feeling that this city's dying 
He said, it's not dying it's the people who are dying 
She said, yes, yes I think the people are dying and nobody cares. 

We had all this technology our dreams were bold and vague 
And then one city got bad planners, one city got the plague. 

He asked why did you move here? She said, for the job 
For the job and I've been so lonely here, so lonely 
There's no one I can talk to, you know I don't even know your brother. 

He smiled and said, sometimes at night I walk out by the river 
The city's one big town, the water turns it upside down 
People found this city because they love other people 
They want their secretaries, they want their power lunches. 

And think about tonight, I heard the same newscast you did 
I unplugged everything, I looked out the window 
And I think the city heard, I watched as one by one the lights went off 
So they could give their power to the hospital 

They ate in silence while she thought this over, 
They sat together in a dark room in the Mortal City 
Shifting in their blankets so they wouldn't get spaghetti on them. 

Then came the awkward moment after dinner, what to do, 
The ice was still falling, the streets were still dangerous 
The cabs were not running and this neighborhood was not the greatest. 

They both looked at the space where a couch would've been 
She felt her stomach sink, she felt like she could hardly think 

She said, I never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City 
The cold comes through eve crack I put my hand up to 
The radiator doesn't work, I have to use electric heat. 

That settled it, they would both sleep in her bed 
It was a matter of survival. 

She brought out t-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, socks, hats 
If there was ever any thought of what would happen in that bed tonight 
There was no question now 
They could barely move 
They were wrapped up like ornaments waiting for another season. 

They lay in bed, they listened to the pelting ice 
He said my brother's not a bad guy, he's just quiet 
I wished you liked this city 
She said, maybe I do. 

I think I have a special kind of hearing tonight 
I hear the neighbors upstairs 
I hear my heart beating 
I hear one thousand hearts beating at the hospital 
And one thousand hearts by their bedsides waiting 
Saying that's my love in the white gown,

Oh I must confess, I was drawn, I was drawn to the ocean
I thought it spoke to me, it said, ""Look at us,
We're not churches, not schools, not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?""
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body
And that's when I came back to town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly, oh the ocean said
""What are you trying to find, I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors, I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean,""
But the ocean can't come to this town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

And the ones that can know you so well are the ones that can swallow you whole.
I have a good and I have an evil, I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I didn't go back today
I wanted to show you that I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them
You said, ""Let me tell you the song of this town""
You said, ""Everything closes at five. After that, well, you just got the bars
You don't know how precious you are, walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean.

It's where we came from, you know, and sometimes I just want to go back
After a day, we drink til we're drowning, walk to the ocean, wade in with our work boots
Wade in our work boots, try to finish the job.

I'm not a left-wing rhetoric mobilizing force of one,

Many years ago in college, don't laugh, 
But I thought I was a radical, 
I ran the Hemp Liberation Group with my boyfriend, 
It was true love, with a common cause, 
And besides that, he was a Sagittarius. 

We used to say that our love was like hemp rope, 
Three times as strong as the rope that you buy domestically, 
And we would bond in the face of oppression from big business and the deans, 
But I knew there was a problem, 
Every time the group would meet everyone would light up, 
That made it difficult to discuss glaucoma and human rights, 
Not to mention chemotherapy. 

Well sometimes, life gives us lessons sent in ridiculous packaging, 
And so I found him in the arms of a Student Against the Treacherous use of Fur, 
And he gave no apology, he just turned to me, stoned out to the edge of oblivion, 
He didn't pull up the sheets and I think he even smiled as he said to me, 
""Well, I guess our dreams went up in smoke."" 

And I said, No, our dreams went up in dreams, you stupid pothead, 
And another thing, what kind of a name is 
Students Against the Treacherous Use of Fur? 
Fur is already dead, and besides, 
A name like that doesn't make a good acronym. 

I am older now, I know the rise 
And gradual fall of a daily victory. 
And I still write to my senators, 
Saying they should legalize cannabis,

My friends give me purple flowers and orange tea 
On goosedown spilling quilts and turquoise chairs 
We greet each other in a wild profusion of words 
And wave farewell amidst the wonderment of air 
And in the laughing times we know that we are lucky 
And in the quiet times we know that we are blessed 
And we will not be alone 

Well, the light that stopped the night felt like forgiveness to you 
As the garbage trucks came bustling through their rounds 
You stared at the pictures on your wall and all the postcards from your friends

Where the downtowns hold the sadness of you can't go back again 

It's there you'll find the rust and debtors 
Motel signs with missing letters 
Cause there's a monster on the outskirts 
Says it knows what your town needs 
Then it eats it up like nothing and it won't spit out the seeds 
And we can be the super shoppers 
We can say we're really smart 
We can say our town is doing fine without a beating heart 

We can even say the money saved is all our own 
It's bought and sold, it's bought and sold 
And we're heading for a nasty business, keeps our country growing 
Where the weapons that we're selling are the only seeds we're sowing 

You get to blow the fruits of all your labors 
Sell F-16's to all the neighbors 
And we know that it's for money 
And that's how the west gets bargained

And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And you both look so young 
And last night was hard, you said 
You packed up every room 
And then you cried and went to bed 
But today you closed the door and said 
""We have to get a move on. 
It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead, 
We push ourselves ahead."" 

And it was cloudy in the morning 
And it rained as you drove away 
And the same things looked different 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
When you move to another place 

And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same 
She walked alone all spring, 
She had a boyfriend when the summer came 
And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm 
They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn 
And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving 
So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves 
She held on to his sleeves 

And she doesn't want to let go 
'Cause she won't know what she's up against 
The classrooms and the smart girls 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you hang your flowers up to dry 

And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head 
It felt like the first day of school 
But I was going to the moon instead 
And I walked down the hall 
With the notebooks they got for me 
My dad led me through the house 
My mom drank instant coffee 
And I knew that I would crash 
But I didn't want to tell them 
There are just some moments when your family makes sense 
They just make sense 

So I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on 
We walked out on the dark and frozen grass 
The end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you send your children to the moon 

The summer ends and we wonder who we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree 
I passed the farms that made it 
Through the last days of the century 
And I knew that I was going to learn again 
Again, in this less hazy light 
I saw the fields beyond the fields 
The fields beyond the fields 

And the colors are much brighter now

You always surprised me

And if I wrote You
If I wrote You
You would know me
And you would not write me again

And when the spring came and flooded all the streams
It's like how you got the night you told me all your dreams

It's like how you got when you knew the truth was the only way out 
But not the only way

And if I wrote you

You would know me

And he's a thoughtful man 
It's just he likes to keep his thoughts up in his head 
And we finally meet, and she tries to draw him out a bit 

She says ""He's writing something, 
Hey now, why don't you talk about it?"" 
And he doesn't make a sound 
He's just staring at his coffee 
And I know there's all this beauty 
And this greatness she'll defend 
But I think it's in my friend 

I have a friend in a bright and distant town 
She's found a common balance 
Where you do your work, and you do your love 
And they pay you, and praise your many talents

Dar Williams,"When he turned 34 but who's counting
He couldn't find anyone who wanted to party
So he walked around a playground with a bag of Mickey's Tallboys
And he heard the sound of laughter and he followed it for fifteen blocks
There was a house between Mavis and Water
They were out on the porch, they were inside playing quarters
And he said, ""Don't you know the game Kazaam? It's a better game,
You point your elbow at someone and say somebody else's name 
And it alternates whose turn it is and if you lose you drink.""
They said ""Man, you really make us think,
Yeah you make us think and so

Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation
So have a seat, what's in the bag?
Party on.""

Round about one or two it started winding down
And he knew what they needed they needed donuts
So they walked out to Krispy Kruller's All night Sugar Palace
It was there in the doorway he said, ""Oh, well maybe not.""
Inside there were six women talking
They were the most justified angry ex-girlfriends
And they swivelled around slowly like they saw something bad
Through the eyes in the back of their heads
Like he always knew they had
And they said, ""What a coincidence,"" and ""Hey, you're just the man,
We were saying that you did the best you could
You're fine, we understand and so

Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation
You were the best but we'll survive 
Party on.""

In the morning they sent him home with a designated driver
And he lay down and thought about the whole night
And he looked up at the photo that he bought at a junk shop
It was only fifty cents but he framed it and everything
It was the kind of party that you hope never ends
The lucky party boy surrounded by his friends
And they were all in pointed hats 
Caught in a rebel birthday shout
And he was at the candles with his mom there to help him out
There was a lot that you could learn if you lay near them
Like if you listened you could hear them and he could hear them

They say,
Tonight we're gonna be the party
We will party all night long
We are the party generation 
So lift your head and blow 'em out

Going east of Mississippi got a flinty kind of woman 
And you don't act smart and you don't touch my children 
If the young man wants to see the sun go down 

Well there was no time fooling with the trifles 
So there was no use in telling the men 
They would just go running for their rifles 
And then once you got him couldn't get him again 
So Peg got a bolt of fishing tackle 
And Marge got her gardening clips 
And Sally LaBiche put her hound on a leash 
And the timer on the quiche, she's kind of nouveau riche 
But we like her 

Going east of Mississippi got a flinty kind of woman 
And you don't act fresh and you don't touch my children 
If the young man wants to see the sun go down 

It was the kids who spotted him a running 
As we drove through the harbor fog 
And that's when we got our engines gunning 
'Cause we knew he was headed for the cranberry bog 
We got our hip-high rubber boots strapped on 
And Molly got the big flashlights out 
And by the ""Welcome to New England"" sign 
Got him with the fishing line 
In the dark smell of brine 
Betty said ""This one is mine."" 
She is ruthless 

Going east of Mississippi got a flinty kind of woman 
And you just say no and you don't touch my children 
If the young man wants to see the sun go down 

Well we didn't have to drag him and a-jail him 
'Cause you don't have to take it so far 
When your roots go back to Old Salem 
And you've got a local chapter of the DAR 
Now I don't go tooting on my lobsters 
'Cause your pride doesn't go with your plaid 
But it's a victory won and it couldn't be done

Dar Williams,"Go ahead push your luck
Find out how much love the world can hold
Once upon a time I had control and reined my soul in tight
Well the whole truth
Is like the story of a wave unfurled
But I held the evil of the world
So I stopped the tide
Froze it up from inside
And it felt like

A winter machine that you go through and then
You catch your breath and winter starts again
And everyone else is spring bound
But when I chose to live

There was no joy it's just a line I crossed
It wasn't worth the pain my death would cost
So I was not lost or found
And if I was to sleep

I knew my family had more truth to tell
And so I traveled down a whispering well
To know myself through them
Growing up my mom had a room full of books
And hid away in there

Her father raging down a spiral stair
Till he found someone most days his son
And sometimes I think my father, too, is a refugee
I know they tried to keep their pain from me
They could not see what it was for
But now I'm sleeping fine

Sometimes the truth is like a second chance
I am the daughter of a great romance
And they are the children of the war
Well the sun rose

With so many colors it nearly broke my heart
It worked me over like a work of art
And I was apart of all that
So go ahead push your luck

Say what it is you gotta say to me
We will push on into that mystery
And it will push right back
And there are worse things than that
'cause for every price and every penance that I could think of

It's better to have fallen in love
Than never to have fallen at all
'cause when you live in a world
Well it gets in to who you thought you'd be
And now I laugh at how the world changed me
I think life chose me

The truth was all around us now

And now we have to live with what we did

Build your love but there's a beauty
Well you know the scriptures tell
There are a few shards left in hell
And if we want a god we had to follow, follow him down

Pictures torn out of their frames
And orgies where we lost our names
All were gone with time's real desire 
Well, you ask how God can curse you thus
That's not a question asked by us

We fear we've lost the fire

But I won't be your Yoko Ono
If you're not good enough for me 

Some will give their love for fashion
Others trade their gold for passion
I don't have the goods to start with
Never had the reins to part with
Still, I hope you take me seriously 

'Cause I think I could go
Deep as the sea of Yoko
You don't know a person like me
I could sell your songs to Nike
And for all you know
I could save your soul 
As only true love can change your mind
Make you leave your screaming fans behind

When John called the wind an opera
Making love with every chakra
When he said her voice would carry
And when he whispered old Chuck Berry
Only then would Yoko set him free 

Fame will come and vanish later
Transcendental love is greater
I think if we had this somehow
We'd be feeling famous right now
We'd be saying love is all you need 

And they could rag about me

Dar Williams,"The summer ends and we wonder where we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And you both look so young 
And last night was hard, you said 
You packed up every room 
And then you cried and went to bed 
But today you closed the door and said 
""We have to get a move on. 
It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead, 
We push ourselves ahead."" 

And it was cloudy in the morning 
And it rained as you drove away 
And the same things looked different 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
When you move to another place 

And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same 
She walked alone all spring, 
She had a boyfriend when the summer came 
And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm 
They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn 
And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving 
So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves 
She held on to his sleeves 

And she doesn't want to let go 
'Cause she won't know what she's up against 
The classrooms and the smart girls 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you hang your flowers up to dry 

And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head 
It felt like the first day of school 
But I was going to the moon instead 
And I walked down the hall 
With the notebooks they got for me 
My dad led me through the house 
My mom drank instant coffee 
And I knew that I would crash 
But I didn't want to tell them 
There are just some moments when your family makes sense 
They just make sense 

So I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on 
We walked out on the dark and frozen grass 
The end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you send your children to the moon 

The summer ends and we wonder who we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree 
I passed the farms that made it 
Through the last days of the century 
And I knew that I was going to learn again 
Again, in this less hazy light 
I saw the fields beyond the fields 
The fields beyond the fields 

And the colors are much brighter now 
It's like they really want to tell the truth 
We give our testimony to the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
You can spin the light to gold.",Iowa,2001

From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
[God blessed America for me.]
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:
[God blessed America for me.]

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
[God blessed America for me.]

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
[God blessed America for me.]

One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if

and we'll all go together to pull wild mountain thyme 
all around the blooming heather.

by yon pure and crystal fountain 
and on it i will pile
all the flowers of the mountain.

No need for greed or hunger

you run away from me
I miss the time we did not have
but the rain keeps washing my sadness away

I close myself in my castle
never to come out
to give vent to my evil thoughts
to remain there in shadows in forgetfullness

You're just two umbrellas one late afternoon

Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 

And there's nothing wrong but there is something more 
And sometimes you wonder what you love her for 
She says you've known her deepest fears 
'Cause she showed you a box of stained-glass tears 
It can't be all, the truth about the rain 
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 

But when she gave you more to find 
You let her think she'd lost her mind 
And that's all on you 
Feeling helpless if she asked for help 
Or scared you'd have to change yourself 

And you can't deny this room will keep you warm. 
You can look out of your window at the storm 
But you watch the phone and hope it rings

Or how she calls, the beauty of the rain

There's the weak and the strong and the beds that have no answer,

And they scratched at the ground.

we go to some Grey sky diner for eggs and toast
New York Times or the New York Post
Then we take a ride through the valley of the shadow of death
But even for us New Yorkers, there's a time in every day
The river takes our breath away

[Chorus:]
And the Hudson, it holds the life
We thought we did it on our own

The river roads collect the tolls
For the passage of our souls
Through silence, over woods, through flowers and snow
And past the George Washington Bridge
Down from the trails of Breakneck Ridge
The river's ancient path is sacred and slow

And as it swings through Harlem,
It's every shade of blue
Into the city of the new brand new

And the Hudson, it holds the life
We thought we did it on our own
I thought I had no sense of place or past
Time was too slow, but then too fast
The river takes us home at last

Where and when does the memory take hold
Mountain range in the Autumn cold
And I thought West Point was Camelot in the spring
If you're lucky you'll find something that reflects you
Helps you feel your life protects you
Cradles you and connects you to everything
This whole life I remember as they begged them to itself
Never turn me into someone else

[Chorus x2]",The Hudson,2005
Dar Williams,"I tried again, I went last night
Another date was just not right
And as I drove myself back home
A little voice said ""just be alone""
But sometimes I think
I see you in a crowd
It's not picture perfect you're just meant for me somehow
And I'll miss you till I meet you
Oh I'll miss you till I meet you

I miss you all the time

I love the world just as it is
And I won't lose my faith in it
But there are days I think of you
Saying ""Hey that's beautiful yeah I see it too""
It all goes by so fast, like waving hands
Wanna capture things
Find someone who understands
And I'll miss you till I meet you
Oh I'll miss you till I meet you

I miss you all the time

Can you keep me awake
I thought you could help
Just to feel my way
Find my better self
Oh I'll miss you
Oh I'll miss you
I miss you all the time

All dreamed away
But that's all right

That they might see
The next chapter of their destiny
And on Monday morning comes around

And I'll miss you till I meet you",I'll Miss You Till I Meet You,2005

So close to my heart
I dropped everything when you came through
So close to my heart
And I put my pens and my paint box aside
Oh so close to my heart
And the river that ran down the rock face dried
Oh so close to my heart
When you were close to my heart
It was an honor that you ran so free

So close to my heart
I thought I'd lost something forever, silly me
So close to my heart
But the place you hid in as bare as it seems
So close to my heart
It held my will in its infinite dreams
So close to my heart
When you were close to my heart

So now you're gone and now we'll both find our ways
So close to our hearts
By the forge that leaves a stamp on each day
So close to our hearts
And we'll long to make great things in our lives
So close to our hearts
And we'll wonder if what we make survives
Oh to the beat of the heart
It's the work of the heart
But you were close to my heart",So Close to My Heart,2005

Leaving God's bright stamp
On Peach Branch Horse and Bible Camp
Where we're splashing in the water
Joined in song
Swimming with the Spirit the whole day long
I'm a teen for God

God is watching, teen for God
God is watching, teen for God

The girls have looks and the girls have rules
They came here from their Bible schools
They can make you pay attention
To the way you dress and eat
Make you trip over your own two feet and they
Kneel down on their towels at night
Their nightgowns glow with a Holy light
And we pray for the sinners
And their drunken car wrecks
And vow that I'll never get high
And have sex
I'm a teen for God

God is watching, teen for God
God is watching, teen for God

And God made every leaf on every tree
Each grain of sand
God has a plan
For what we're meant to be
I gotta wait for God

Dear Lord
I plan each day
The things I will not do or say
But I'm driven by a passion
Is it only there to tame?
It fills my heart and it calls my name and
This world that you made for us
I know, I know, is dangerous
So I ride a lot of horses
And I never even swear
Sorta like praying I'm just not there

Oh God

God is watching, oh God
God is watching

But God made love
God made the rivers run
And cowboy boots and bathing suits
And the boy's skin dries in the sun
You gotta help me, God

Help me know, four years from now
I won't believe in you anyhow
And I'll mope around the campus
And I'll feel betrayed
All those guilty summers I stayed
But then I'll laugh
That I fell for the lure
Of the pain of desire to feel so pure
And I'll bear all the burdens
Of my little daily crimes
Wish I had a God for such cynical times
Far from today

But for now I'm a sacred vessel
Rip me open, I spread your word
Like a milkweed pod
I'm a radio station,
Your Holy transmission
Even more, like a lightning rod

I'm a lightning rod, a teen for God

God is watching... a teen for God",Teen for God,2005

And I've never found a way to say I love you, but if the chance came by, oh I, I would,
But way back where I come from, we never mean to bother,
We don't like to make our passions other peoples concern,
And we walk in the world of safe people, and at night we walk into our houses and burn.

Iowa oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
How I long to fall just a little bit, to dance out of the lines and stray from the light,
But I fear that to fall in love with you is to fall from a great and gruesome height.
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, her husband had just left her,
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said,
""what is love, where did it get me? whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Ioway oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
Once I had everything, I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway and the words I've never felt.
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and id do it again,
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion,
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see,
You were a-wandering out on the hills of iowa and you were not thinking of me.

We are following our children
And we paint in different colors every day

We will work beside them as they build modest houses
And on a misty April morning we'll rest the shovels on the fence
And die and become a summer day

And yes I know it's just lousy old Hollywood
Jostling for one more song and dance
But you are everyone, you are everyone
I ever trusted that never made a fool out of me

Early again today I rushed myself around
I thought that I would miss the morning train
Angry that I had lain in my bed too long
Watching all the patterns of the rain
So many trips I took to seek somebody out
Gaining some ground but maybe losing more
So many pages scrawled to justify myself
I don't know who I did that for
But you are everyone, you are everyone
I ever trusted that never made a fool out of me

You took a couple pictures of me once
On some winter night long ago
Simply of me, you might not call them beautiful
I take them everywhere I go
But you are everyone, you are everyone
I ever trusted that never made a fool out of me",You Are Everyone,2008
Dar Williams,"Well I've heard enough
And I've seen enough
And I know enough to know...
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go.

Well I've been around
I've been up and down
Until I bent out of control.
With your world all in motion,
Gotta put a ball
And a chain on your soul.

All those angels running,
Picking up the pieces,
Putting back together 
Hearts broke long ago.
I know a good thing when I see it,
And it's a bad thing to let go

There will always be lovers
With borders of their own,
And you may charge across
In a golden chariot,
But you will never be at home

'Cause I had dreams
Like distant thunder;
I had hope like a prayer unheard.
And this nothing less than perfect
In a less than perfect world.

Dar Williams,"I knew a guy, I thought he was my first love
But he had to decide between me and the one before
And she stacked it all up, like a house of cards
Said if he didn't come back, he'd find her flattened on the floor

And though I went and lived in my own hell
Thought that I could die as well
I let him go where he thought he had to go

'Cause I never took heavy words for granted
And I never took undeserved advantage
No, I never took the easy way
So why don't you take it a little easy on me now?

Out on the road, I had so many questions
I thought I would explode just for some attention
Like an acolyte, I saw the flames of towering tapers
Almost proselytized by those gleaming piles of paper

Yeah, I watched the power huddles
And their coats draped over puddles
And their trust me, baby, I'm the one you need

But I never took heavy words for granted
And I never took undeserved advantage
No, I never took the easy way
So why don't you take it a little easy on me now?

'Cause we don't want to be the ones
To lie and cheat and slander
So we hold each other up to the higher standard
But I'll tell you what, I'll never try to make it hard
?Cause when you're hard just to be hard
The only thing that's hard is you

So here's what I took, I kept the wine and laughter
Until every path just grew up and ever after
Through the peaks and twisty canyons
I made many great companions
Best of all is the one who loves me like you do

'Cause I never took heavy words for granted
And I never took undeserved advantage
No, I never took the easy way
So why don't you take it a little easy on me now?

Dar Williams,"I won't forget when Peter Pan came to my house, took my hand
I said I was a boy
I'm glad he didn't check
I learned to fly, I learned to fight
I lived a whole life in one night
We saved each other's lives out on the pirate's deck
And I remember that night
When I'm leaving a late night with some friends
And I hear somebody tell me it's not safe, someone should help me
I need to find a nice man to walk me home
When I was a boy, I scared the pants off of my mom
Climbed what I could climb upon

And I don't know how I survived
I guess I knew the tricks that all boys knew
And you can walk me home, but I was a boy, too

I was a kid that you would like, just a small boy on her bike
Riding topless, yeah, I never cared who saw
My neighbor came outside to say, ""get your shirt""
I said ""no way, it's the last time I'm not breaking any law""
And now I'm in a clothing store, and the sign says less is more
More that's tight means more to see, more for them, not more for me
That can't help me climb a tree in ten seconds flat

When I was a boy, see that picture? that was me
Grass-stained shirt and dusty knees
And I know things have gotta change
They got pills to sell, they've got implants to put in, they've got implants to remove
But I am not forgetting
That I was a boy, too

And like the woods where I would creep, it's a secret I can keep
Except when I'm tired, except when I'm being caught off guard
I've had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way
To catching fire-flies out in the backyard
And I tell the man I'm with about the other life I lived
And I say now you're top gun
I have lost and you have won
He says, ""oh no, no, can't you see?""
When I was a girl, my mom and I, we always talked
And I picked flowers everywhere that I walked
And I could always cry, now even when I'm alone I seldom do

There was this angel, and it won't let me go

This shit got me pissed off, we use to be like rollies
But now it's two thousand, the motherfuckers don't even know me
If I'm right, pass me cause they lifted up a hand now
Blinded to em every time I get the trash now
Either could get put up on it, and coming up strong
We knew right from wrong, but still we stayed away from home
Over there on Konkress, kicking at the park with
A blessed up niggas that's down with me to your dark with
We'll meet again, I put this on a fiend
If it's possible they end up cause we gone drink again
Puffing on this dro ain't the same no mo'
Drinking on this henne shit just ain't the same no mo'
Oh, my nigga lost his life, at an early age
And I cry to this day, wishing that he could of stayed
Played the cards that he was dealt, records gone when it's dark
But my nigga roll in death, as the gauge exploded on the block
And just like Pac, I'ma paint a point of picture, kick it with you
Grab some tissue, wipe my eyes cause I miss you
God bless my niggas, I know you still here with us niggas
Cause I could feel you, I could see you every time I look in the mirror
And not a word can hear you, cause I'm making these words clearer
You are my angel, and my nigga, from the drive-by to the trigga
Chi worldwide, whoever died on any side

Sur les plac's et les cours,
On voit sous les platanes
Plus d'un groupe s'amener,
Ce sont les acharnés,
Les joyeux boulomanes,
On joue ça en quinze points,
Faut voir avec quel soin
On sort ses intégrales ;
On  lance un goder
Qui tourne dans l'air.
Si c'est pile : "" A toi Bébert ! ""
"" Vas-y Léon. Envoie bien le bouchon ! ""

Ca fait plaisir.

Comme à loisir.
Tu la vise et tu la manques
Change ton tir !
Une partie de pétanque,

Il faut voir le beau Chichois,
En chemise de soie,
Pantalon de flanelle,
Le foulard, et le pailleux
Rabattu sur les yeux,
Jouer sa matérielle
Avec Titin ou Pauleau.
Quand pour un joli lot
Il se prend de querelle,
Il lui dit, moqueur si tu es vainqueur
Eh ben ! tu auras son coeur ;
"" Si tu es vaincu,
Ben !...je t'en dis pas plus ! ""

C'est surtout au cabanon
Que nous nous en donnons
Au soleil le dimanche
On se met à quatre ou six
Pour un Vermouth Cassis
On en fait plusieurs manches.

S'égare sous les branches.

Nous marquerons les points ! ""

Darcy Cotten,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2009

Heute ein Star und früher noch Grammwaage
Ganz schnell Groupies in Gucci wegficken
Danach drück' ich auf die Tube à la Lewis Hamilton
Bin ein unbeschriebenes Blatt wie meine Klassenarbeit
Doch sei dabei wie das ganze Land schreit: „Ey, Bra“
Bin am Ballen wie die Lakers
Ich habe Amnesia in der DNA
Du ballerst dir Galenika
Du Pisser hast 'ne große Fresse wie ein Pelikan
Oh je, Digga, du bist kein Prediger
Also babbel bitte mal ein bisschen weniger
Album 2017, ich bau' eine Bombe wie Chemiker in Amerika

Digga, bin am Ballen, so wie Kobe Bryant
Ich sitz' im Escalade und lade meine Homies ein
Ich will stoney sein, mach' mein OG klein
Ich bleib' Bandit und ich geb' einen Fick auf Polizei

Ich bin am Ballen wie Kobe (yeah)

Hypnotize ist 'ne Bildung wie'n Speedboot
Crack, Heroin ist die Mischung, sie bringt um
Gas geben, Nachtleben, lahm legen
Für die Brüder, die nacheinander Jahre lang in den Knast gehen
