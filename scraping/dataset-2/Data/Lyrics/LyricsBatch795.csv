Oba Oba Samba House,"'Tô por aí, por toda a cidade
Curtindo saudade, 'tô por aí
No último volume o som do carro
Um gole de cerveja, um cigarro
Olhar perdido em alta madrugada
'Tô por aí

Pra onde ir, pra quem sorrir?
Em cada esquina aumenta a minha solidão
Meu desejo procurando Outra emoção
'Tô por aí, vou por aí

Eu morro de amor por ela
E ela nem aí (ela nem aí)
Saudade rasgando o peito
Pra onde ir?

Eu morro de amor por ela
E ela nem aí (ela nem aí)
Noite fria madrugada, 'tô por aí
Vou por aí, pra onde ir?

'Tô por aí, pra quem sorrir?

Você pode encontrar muitos amores
Mas ninguém vai te dar o que eu te dei
Podem até te dar algum prazer
Mas posso até jurar, você vai ver
Que ninguém vai te amar como eu te amei

Você pode provar milhões de beijos
Mas sei que você vai lembrar de mim
Pois sempre que um outro te tocar
Na hora você pode se entregar
Mas não vai me esquecer nem mesmo assim

Eu vou ficar
Guardado no seu coração
Na noite fria solidão
Saudade vai chamar meu nome
Eu vou ficar
Num verso triste de paixão
Em cada sonho de verão
No toque do seu telefone
Você vai ver!

Clareando a foto sobre a mesa 
E eu comigo aqui trancado 
Nesse apartamento 

Olhando o brilho dos faróis
Eu me pego a pensar em nós 
Voando na velocidade 
Do meu pensamento

E saio a te procurar 
Nas esquinas, em qualquer lugar 
E as vezes chego a te encontrar 
Num gole de cerveja

E quando vem a lucidez 
Estou sozinho outra vez
E entao volto a conversar 
Com minha tristeza 

Vou chorar, desculpe mas eu vou chorar 
Não ligue, se eu não te ligar
Faz parte dessa solidão
Vou chorar, desculpe mas eu vou chorar 
Na hora em que você voltar

Oba Oba Samba House,"Não há disfarce nesse teu olhar
Incendeia o meu coração
Esse desejo te revelará
Em um simples gesto qual será sua intenção

Eu só quero que você entenda
Que o meu sentimento é verdadeiro
Não há mistérios quando o amor chegar

Seu olhar foi de encontro ao meu
E o meu destino está junto ao teu
Meu vício, mania
Eu desvendei os mistérios do seu coração

Você já percebeu que quando eu te vejo eu perco o chão?
Que o simples fato de te ouvir me faz perder toda razão
Quando você chega minha mão transpira
Minha noite brilha eu já não sei o que fazer
Já vi que esse lance 'tá ficando chato
Pois até meus atos não consigo mais conter
Não ligo se você nem 'tá ligando
Nem tão pouco se importando
Mesmo assim vou te dizer

Já dei tempo ao tempo
Mas o tempo não me ajuda
Se tento te esquecer
Só faço te querer

Está escrito em meu olhar
Um sentimento quando acaba
Coração então desaba
Dá vontade de chorar

O beijo não é mais gostoso
Fazer amor não dá prazer
Já não te sinto em meu abraço
Só eu sei o que que eu passo

E dessa vez vou acordar sozinho
Vai ser melhor pra nós
Vai ser melhor pra mim

Obacha,"Die Haze Knolle lockt, verführt zum Rauchen
ich will den Druck im Kopf und glühende Augen
Haze so Lila wie die Kuh von Milka 
sehe schon wieder die Kuh von Milka?! 
Jucken in der Lunge bringt mich zum Gras wickeln 
Grünes ruft wie 'ne Latina mit Arsch und Titten
Leute haben Stress mit Weed , fragen wegen Gras 
während ich schon Fresskick schieb auf Häagen Dazs.
Dein Kokolores kommt mir nich in die Tüte 
Bruda nimm mein Haze macht dicht und nich müde
Jetzt hast du Laberflash 
hör auf zu Texten überlass es lieber Frauen die Flat SMSen
Passt du nich auf hast du keinen Krümel schiebst abfuck wie Chinese über kleinen Lümmel  deshalb solltest du auf eine Regel achten zähl so viele Knospen du kannst bevor du schmachtest

Orange Haare und die Hellgrüne Haut
hol aus der Bauchtasche von Eastpak Tüten raus
Die gewählte Knospe riecht wie Käse mit Kotze 
wenn ich rauche sind die Augen wie bei Chinesen geschlossen
Ok, ich mach den Klebestreifen zu
aktiver THC-Gehalt durch Haze in meine Blut Nuttö
Kiffen ist gesünder als Obst und Gemüse 
deshalb pief ich täglich V8-Auspuff große Dübel
Wenn ich die Knospe aufmache riecht's wie das Arschlosch einer Südamerikanerin (Dschungelgeräusche)
Dein billiges Hanf mit Holzstängeln is Tabu
ich rauch lieber mein Hasch mit Goldstempel aus Kabul
Is' jut, rauch mit, lass mal dein 5er stecken
ein Zug reicht aus und du wirst Rückwärts sprechen
Habe die klebrigste Pflanze und Drogengeld
deshalb bin ich bewaffnet mit Crunchchips und Chocomel

Ahh , Obacha, ich rauch ein Blunt 
weg mit Kirschengeschmack, Grabis wird bei Kanacken im Viertel verpackt
Wo ich wohne und mir dann vom Chinamann 
(? für Teller pack von deinem Packet wieder 4 Viertel ab?)
Glänzende Knollen ohne Stängel bekommen ?
Fresskicks mit Cola,Chips & Mandelpralinen jeder 
um mich rum will vom Hase mal ziehen, ah
Blueberry Cheesy Haze , dicke Lachkicks 
im Chatroulette mit Ay Yildiz Base..
Wir sind streunende Köter die Träume gestört haben 
Menschen die nix tun sondern Bäume verkörpern
Druck in der Lunge durch THC intus jeder is auf Turkey 
und ein Dicker geht Dick plus

Obadiah Parker,"My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure

But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door

Oh you think you got it
But got it just don't get it
Till there's nothing at all

We get together
Oh we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved

If what they say that
""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Love the exception

Que en La Manigua vivía
Cuando el mambí se batía
Con el machete en la mano
Con el machete en la mano

Tengo un poder soberano
Que me lo dio la sábana
De cantarle a la mañana
Brindándole mi saludo
A la palma, y al escudo
Y a mi bandera cubana, y a mi bandera cubana

Ay por eso canto a las flores
Y a la mañana que inspira
Ay le canto a Cuba querida
La tierra de mis amores
Ay le canto a Cuba querida
La tierra de mis amores

Soy la linda melodía
Que en el campestre retiro
Siempre le llevo al guajiro
La esperanza y la alegría
La esperanza y la alegría

En noches de romería
Inspiro a los trovadores
Cantantes y bailadores
Gozan con el zapateo
Y se olvidan de Morfeo
Para tributarme honores
Para tributarme honores

Ay por eso canto a las flores
Y a la mañana que inspira
Ay le canto a Cuba querida
La tierra de mis amores
Ay le canto a Cuba querida
La tierra de mis amores

Ahora me encuentro en La Habana
Entre orquestas y he gustado,
De cha-cha-chá disfrazado
Pongo una nota cubana
Pongo una nota cubana

Aquí como en la sabana
Mi música espiritual
Viene del cañaveral
Representando al mambí
A la tierra de Martí
Y a la enseña nacional

Obie Bermúdez,"Evadiendo calles y contando el sueldo
Y ella en su automóvil último modelo
Él llenando estanques y limpiando espejos
Y ella perfumada con su pelo suelto

Y en una mirada se pintaron sueños
Le salieron alas y tocaron el cielo
Y él imagino que eran ricos y se amaban
Y ella imagino que el dinero no importaba
Porque amor no les faltaba

Soñaron, soñaron que eran dos enamorados
Sin futuro sin pasado, soñaron, soñaron
Que los dos eran iguales
Con las mismas realidades, el amor, el amor

Ella le pagó lo que le debía
Y así despertaron de su fantasía
Y se despidieron con una sonrisa
Como confirmando lo que se sabía

Y el imagino que eran ricos y se amaban
Y ella imagino que el dinero no importaba
Porque amor no les faltaba

Soñaron, soñaron que eran dos enamorados
Sin futuro sin pasado, soñaron, soñaron
Que los dos eran iguales
Con las mismas realidades, el amor, el amor

Obie Bermúdez,"He soñado tantas veces lo que te quiero decir
Cuando te tenga enfrente pegadita a mi
Tú con tus cartas siempre llenas de amor
Tú constancia fue el abrazo que calmo el dolor

Aún recuerdo bien el día aquel
En que por medio de un teléfono why cristal te pude ver
Cuando te dije ""Mejor busca otro querer""
Te negaste why me entregaste la esperanza del ayer

4 de Julio, independencia
No la del Yankee la de mi sentencia
Cumplí mi tiempo, tuve paciencia
Saldre con vida, sin mi inocencia

Cuando salga why me recibas no sabré como empezar
Si besarte, contemplarte o simplemente hablar
O quizás sea un silencio la mejor explicación
Que mis ojos sean los que te den todo mi amor

El que ha estado adentro sabe que jamás podrá olvidar
Que la cárcel te despoja de ilusion why humanidad
Pero si un amor es fuerte nada lo derrumbara
Why va creando un camino para de nuevo empezar

No la del Yankee la de mi sentencia
Cumplí mi tiempo, tuve paciencia
Si salgo vivo, fue por tu existencia

He soñado tantas veces lo que te quiero decir

De repente llega Paco con su guille del Mesías
Quiere abrir la vieja iglesia y me ofreció ser diácono
Quiere hacer de cuatro tablas un pequeño vaticano
En bersen de new que profecía

Empeñado en el proceso y sus preparativos
Fue regando la noticia al que encontraba en su camino
Mientras que en la casa las dos hijas bien contentas
Porque piensan que ahora tienen quien por ellas rinda cuentas

Un hombre en la búsqueda total
De una vida nueva y diferente
Pero le quedan cosas por cambiar
Pero él dice que no es nada urgente

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Como el gran Jordán tú verás acumulando puntos llegarás
Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Suenan las campanas y quizás un gran ministro tú serás

Un domingo en la mañana mientras Paco predicaba
De las cosas que en la iglesia se supone no se hablaran
Quiso hacer mención de la palabra abiertamente
Y al instante se esfumó el gozo que habitaba entre la gente

Un hombre en la búsqueda total
De una vida nueva y diferente
Pero le quedan cosas por cambiar

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Como el gran Jordán tú verás acumulando puntos llegarás
Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Suenan las campanas y quizás un gran ministro tú serás

Poco a poco fueron quedando sin el Mesías
Y es obvio que el mensaje escuchar nadie quería
Y una voz en el silencio a Paco le decía
Es que muchas veces la verdad es como un baño de agua fría

Decidido a cultivar las flores de su pueblo
En un monte de ladrillos frialdad y tiroteo
Dejó atrás el pulpito y las cuatro paredes
Regresó a la esquina Paco a cumplir con sus santos deberes

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual

Si fuera fácil, si fuera tan fácil
Yo no estuviera aquí llorando
La nube negra ya hubiera despejado

Si fuera fácil, si fuera tan fácil
Yo estaría deseándote suerte

Obie Bermúdez,"Ella es así deliciosa y divina
Tan misteriosa y eso a mí me fascina
Ella me entiende cuando nadie comprende
Me descontrola modificando mis horas

Modesta y como que orgullosa
Sinonimo de mi verdad, ey
Así que sí algún día preguntan
Porque sigo a su lado yo les digo

Sigo con ella porque me hace soñar
Ella condimenta mis sentidos
Y conduce mis caminos

Sigo con ella porque me hace volar
Es la medicina que mi corazón
Requiere cuando ama aire

Ella es así defunción de mi vida
Tan peligrosa la que vive mis sombras
Ella es la pieza de mi rompe cabeza
Andaba buscando a quien al fin he encontrado

Tranquila y algo de celosa, oh
Antónimo de oscuridad ey
Desarma y arma cuando quiere
Porque tú eres mi perfecta melodía

Sigo con ella porque me hace soñar
Ella condimenta mis sentidos
Y conduce mis caminos

Sigo con ella porque me hace volar
Es la medicina que mi corazón
Requiere cuando ama aja

Hasta en mi música
Se manifiesta su presencia
Ella es mi musa
La quiero, la quiero

Sigo con ella, sigo con ella
Sigo con ella, sigo con ella
Sigo con ella, sigo con ella
Sigo con ella

Sigo con ella porque me hace soñar

Qué raro verte por aquí
Te ves diferente, me sorprende verte
Entra no te quedes ahí

Yo que jure nunca volver a verte
Pensé que siempre fue mejor así
Mejor así, oh, oh

La soledad hoy llega a mi casa
Sin avisar con su equipaje
Se sienta en la mesa y pide café
Me dice que se quedara un rato

La soledad llego tan tranquila
Dice que no tiene prisa
Se sienta en la sala a ver la T.V.
Llego para quedarse esta vez, oh, oh
Llego para quedarse esta vez

Yo te había visto en California
Ponche y seguí para Nueva York
Pasaron los años ya te había olvidado
Hasta llegar a Puerto Rico

Cuando llegué a mi pueblo de Abonito
Me acorralaste y ya no hubo salida
No Hubo salida, oh, oh

La soledad hoy llega a mi casa
Sin avisar con su equipaje
Se sienta en la mesa y pide café

Obie Bermúdez,"Where should I start? Two worlds apart
Don't know place you live, people there
Street, some parks

Back in my brain, trying to explain
That I like your precious smile
Your different style, the words you say

In my thoughts, you come through in Spanish
Speaking your language, I'm trying to get to you
I wanna be sure this time that I have a perfect rhyme
The words are so hard to find, to say you should be mine

What's your name? What should I call you?
Is someone who loves you, waiting at home?
Can I get your phone? I'm sorry, your number
Or should I just wonder and leave you alone?

Why these words? Transfer in anguish
Speaking in Spanglish, trying to get to you
I wanna be sure this time that I have a perfect rhyme
The words are so hard to find, to say you should be mine

I wanna be sure this time that I have a perfect rhyme
The words are so hard to find, to say you should be mine

Yeah I know you.

Last time I saw you
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
Last time you saw me, I was P-I to the motherfucking M-P WHAT!
And lately I heard you a broke bitch living in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb and I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out, but!
She tried to plot on a nigga, vacant lot one shot bitch died go figure
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
Fuck's wrong with this nigga man?
He used to bring her through the hood
Treat the bitch to fucking good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch, faded off the lick she x-rays the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucker shit
Meanwhile in the hood she driving around good
This bitch thinks she's in Hollywood
Meantime she setting the nigga up
Telling us what his stuff she's ready to get him stuck WHAT!

[Chorus]
Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady (that's what I know)
Sex on her mind all the time
And you think that that's your baby (you don't know)
You a good guy that's living a lie
But she dove and played your safety (it's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied
How come that bitch just paged me? (you don't know)

We had to ride on a nigga
Watch him! for the right time to get richer
We decided when the hit was, run up on him, .45 in the ribs what!
This nigga screamed like a bitch
Showed us what his shit hit her, hell of a lick but!
The bitch, who told us bout the bricks exposed us to the nigga
He knew that we'd come BUT! 
Meanwhile in his hood, his niggas is suiting up and 'Timbed', looted up
Rims and new trucks your man 'Living It Up'
Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga the fuck up
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts wit us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up wit the wrong slut
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggas got my back, in fact
They caught on her Ave, flossing in another nigga cab

Rap; I been in it ever since I was invented
That's 'cause a nigga live it

'Cause Em, signed another black boy like he nigga happy
Caucasians, Marshall knows talent
Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired
I hit ya raves, balloons and E's
And bang all your European Pamela Lee's
Fuckin' aye, or how we say it round my way
""Fo sho"", Trice gon' blow, then I'm off to them shows
I'm off across the globe, until my accounts all swoll
For young Kobe big things, act like ya know me

Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?!)
Please believe it, I'm as ""Down to Earth"" as Chris Rock
Gettin hit by trucks, starin' at twat
A big cannon in ya G-spot
Me not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot
Whether or not you believe my status
I'm prepared to be the baddest on the rap that's happenin'
Put the Mitten back on the map with Mathers and win this

Well I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun
Beef? best-a run
'Cause when I pop, people's flesh get numb
And whoa ya might not make it till ya young
The only one with okay's want to blaze
Meet my little friends on racks in my den
Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins
And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film
Deserted, that's word to vacant homes
2002 Trice up in ya headphones
Trice up in ya bows
Then Trice up in ya hoes!
I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin'
With raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me

I keep the club on the vex,
Cause he gotta pay me when I spit, plus replace a lot of shit,
Niggas get a whiling,
When my words echo's the room like, ""get your hand out my pocket"",
You suck shit when my topics rockin,
I'm banned from clubs 'cause my toxic tonsils,
Loud speaker like a fucking sports announcer,
I spit the baa-haa till you rush the bouncer,
I rush the mutherfucker in your way who's bouncing,
You know old christ get their yak's pronouncin'

Out your seat motherfucker, I'm a reach motherfucker,
Shady-records till I sleep motherfuckers

Tear this bitch up till you bleed motherfucker
I would'nt give a fuck who you be motherfucker
Punk, pussy, bitch or G motherfucker
Adrenaline rush before you leave motherfucker

When I speak I blow out your tweeters, yo dog,
Show out in speakers roll out with heaters,
I'm just an animal eating the game,
Jumbo monkey, funky and Obie's the name,
I rose solo, never been a hoe though,
Keep yak's vocal when cats act loco,
Where you at when I'm moving the crowd,
You get trampled, mashed on Detroit style,
Up out your seats, pump out the E's,
Off the beat's the crowd overpleased,
Where my nigga's at smoking them tree's,
Off the cognac, finger fucking the ski's,
That's how it is when you party with me,
You don't like it, you L-7 like a square beat

Yo, yo, since I came I rearrange the place with blaze,
Spays dope with coke-fevers DNA, I'm so addicted,
To gettin nigga's lifted, drunk off a liquid,

Douse'in the crowd with piss and voul's,
We underground motherfucker fix your frown's,
I beat the bore with a wristy tour,
Off a whiskey you never been this deep before,
So throw up your hands and peep out your man's
When I come through next quarter trisectory fen you,
And trust I'm attackin' it,
I hook up the hot shit like ay see we havin it,
That's why I'm so miraculous,
And hope to get you nigga's pumped up,
I see you next time I see him chump,

On your knees drop for these

I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on

I’m here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (for sure)
And I can’t let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yac going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from touring
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out

Right we wanna love alcohol
We wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though

Cause that's sort of unique cause you know it's me

I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'

My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)

When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips

we in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next

And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse
'Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace ha ha ha ha
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo
'Cause you love 'er, you neva' would've expect that blow

Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride)

Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin

[Verse - Obie Trice]
Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)
Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)
But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

'Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach (Nigga)

Forty-four snub hugs my scrotum when I roll, yes I hold my own
Swifty think he Deebo's clone
I'm aimin', watch I'm switchin' to Damon
And ""Next Friday"" I can bet you's a changed man
When them things in hand, it's not a game man
I ghost ya, I bring ya much closer to Jehovah

I hold the toast when I approach

They rush you to 'spital, flyin' by my ride
Engine like, homie you just died
Your family through cryin', I pulled off a crime
Just as quick as

You could lose your face, in a fool's race
I pulled my tool first nigga, you was in second place
And second place just means you didn't react with haste
And this differentiates life where murder being the case
And since murder was the case, it just means niggas erase
Another black mother can't eat the food on her plate
'Cause she ain't got the taste, as of raising you was a waste
""Such a short span young man"" said at your wake
First I'm a man, second I'm five eight, with size and weight
Won't give a nigga the upper hand
'Cause when I pop, I give this up like Barry Sand
Sit in the can, he never ran like Barry Sand
Obie ain't playin', Obie got a plan
And the plan is not to be layin' in earth's land
I will pop before decaying in earth's land
You get shot for playin' me less than a man, motherfucker

But I warn ya the glock could make it hot as California
You be popped on the corner, flesh meetin' the coroner

An since no holes in me, niggaz take advantage
'Til I manage to pull that hammer out they start scattering,
I'm no gangster, I'm a average man
But be damned if I let 'em do me savage man

Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!

Our intimacy is significantly different

Look at my rat like she act brand new
""Hey boo, how are you?""
Yeah, cool, now tally-o your ass back across the room
You see me with Pocahontas
I ain't tryin to be honorary but honestly I ain't tryin be bothered
You got a brain, define honors in college
You'd rather define how your knowledge in chronic
I'm tryin step my game up a notch bitch
Your aim the cock block on my plot bitch
She hot and your not, so stop bitch
Quit blowin up my motherfuckin spot, shit

I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there

I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here

Plus 50 Cent's like ten times badder (girl)
D-12 shouldn't of had him on they album"" (girl)

They nag, when I pose with a chick with nice toes
Ya'll knew O before for new hoes, but since it's a new ho
Just act like you never knew O, boo
We still crew, we just the same (uh huh)
Just not tonight, you don't know my name (you don't know me)

Hey yo fellas, never get timid when the chicken is interferin
When your chillin with a chick, who a ten (damn)
Let her know the situation at hand (uh huh)
And tell the bitch go play with her friends (BITCH)

Can, can you shit on me?
I just want you to shit on me

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

Baby, I'm extra large in magnitude
And Magnum's the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a hoe I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who

When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day
I rush the shit out you off my two-way
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own

No, I'm in and out your home
And this in and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around

I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
Now how that sound?
If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown

Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be

I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV

So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth
And if you believe in that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally

But personally that actually works for me
'Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers

'Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that God damn tavern

And havin' another déjà vu, we seein' security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights
You lookin' at the ice, you ain't lookin' at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I see he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type

Oh, love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe

Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth

So what we do under the covers should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of ""Buzz's New Lovers""
And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors

'Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed, assume it's me and you've done it
And save da used rubber to show 'em the proof of it

But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
'Cause you never know when the shoe
Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you

'Cause you may think you want it then you want me, then you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked, 'cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life 'cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you

You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?
Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you

Have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never
'Cause we gonna be together forever
Right bitch? Right bitch?

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love",Lady,2003

From huggin them corners to appearin on TV
From choppin up nicks, like this here feeds me
To makin 'em hits, like this shit's easy

And truthfully, I'd rather be bullshittin with ya'll
But I gotta chase the donuts, cocoa's growin
And it's like ""oh shit, she was just born""
And now she knowin every song on the radio (radio)
If I hear another Bow Wow quotable (*laughing*, oh no)

Yeah, Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game, profane no image
I came in the game, with a name
I was given from a mayn who ain't give a fuck about his child-ren
I proclaim the name though, never in vain no
Watch the change grow, a young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped the Range Ro', now they want my brains on the main road
They don't understand what I came for
How I came fo', with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Gettin money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, a coffin's the routes I go
Oh that's the road you on, oh no
I'm down for the rifle, tone the fo fo
Don't ever try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that your loco put holes in my photo
NOPE!, HOPE!, hold toast, no jokes, send slugs through your Polo
Just cause our thug roll solo
And po' zone grown folk, be a cold negro
Be-low, your grieved up people
Be-lieve that the boy see no evil

[Chorus - Busta Rhymes]
OHH! I had you yellin out when I backed a 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggaz to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you can yell like other niggaz, your pickin a dirty psycho
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
I visualized it, O. Trice at 25 survived it
Bright but violent, invite the violence
Fist fight a fireman, be a tyrant
'Til these niggaz nights is silent
O. Trice from a trife environment
He 'Rock's the Mic' no sight of retirin
Maybe when the bank accounts light like a fire thin
I'm in the position to hire other clients then
Meanwhile I'm a virus like Iverson
A nigga crossover, Europeans admirin
And the soldier's retirin, I ain't buyin
Motherfuckers actin like you denyin them
Who tryin a nigga, who use buyers
I figure your crew tired, my trigger introduces VIOLENCE
Loose the sirus, you in hospital, orange juice and vitamins
No coke

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Obie Trice]
A derelict who inherited hustle
My heritage married the street struggle
Like a couple of a great unk's ago (yeah)
So this blood streams through my nuts
Seems like I wasn't in touch
When the teacher's ass spoke
Nope, naw I was just a preacher in oath
Sit on the bleachers and flip coke
The only reach you got through my dome
Niggaz yaffle so the gat'll be chrome
Pull the window raffle, so I scramble with a track and the phones (woo)
Fuck a act and a clone, this is actual happening's that's factual back in my home
This is rap, but I ain't rappin so you clappin the zone
Think we trapped in the act, for the sake of performin (nigga)
This is your warnin, run up on the wrong

Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
So much there ain't nothin that we love more than +Pullin Your Skirts Up+
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
What's up with them fuckin one dough a man under-els
Do unto others of you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you [gun cocks]
You will ask youself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
Soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em

We can have it out on any Avenue
A +Average Man+ flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision

Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Push your crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said ""all men get down"" ([gunshot], c'mon)

So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream ""increase the peace""
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Starve ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleepin stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and Lugged up
+Who Want What+ like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin [gunshots]

Know much about my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers (c'mon, [gunshot])
We the soldiers, ya'll the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster [gunshot]

You scared of the drama, bomber the monster [gun cocks, boof]

Niggas is so gangsta, Niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life peddling drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day being able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cause them niggas just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Watching the satellite from ma Bentley
And you niggas don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissing
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissing
And media just feeds into these feuds
Trying to add fuel to the fire
This little nigga Ja Rule talking bout he's gonna slap me
Nigga please, you gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview him
All they doing is making fake threats to us through them
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew him
Pac was a real nigga, you're just a fucking insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passed
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whooping your ass
You're talking to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your air? I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit trying to be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?

The only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
Cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 45 will cease the speech
Yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached the peak, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm trying to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga trying to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxing you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets, I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them with you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit telling all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we'll send Stan to come murder your bitches

Showed us what his shit hit her

Who told us 'bout the bricks
Exposed us to the nigga'
He knew that we'd come
But meanwhile in his hood
His niggaz is suitin' up
And Timbed, looted up
Rims and new trucks your man, 'Livin' It Up'
Then a van with no hubs
Suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga', the fuck up
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched
It's like a rush, the bitch who blushed
And smoked blunts wit us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up wit the wrong slut
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggaz got my back, in fact they caught
On her Ave, flossin' in another nigga' cab

Thick thighs but she full of surprises

I'm just rambling, y'all dick handling
Telling my past and you don't know me

Talk behind backs but never to him dawg
Wouldn't that irritate your boss?

You should mind your business and walk away

I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in ""God""? It's 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

Niggas know what I'm about out here

But as long as I'm here, I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty will make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last set
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I'm packed to pump cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Cop rings like Mike, Larry, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft (Bitch)

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit em, chew em up and spit em out
HRRK-PTT
Too much venom, and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode, soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM)
You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie, we all move like assassins
Ski masks and gloves Consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask be Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, ""you better believe the hype is real""
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin ""P.O."" choke
I'm an OG you fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a Vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back, or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and indo
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco, esse?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha ""D"" in the ""Dy"" is for ""deez nuts""
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months I'm having an E party for Easter, please come squeeze guns

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
You name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, then the bitch don't know me
(50 Cent Ha-ha, Sorry Kim, ha-ha)
(Eminem oh, sorry oh)

Obie Trice,"Yeah, Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game, profane no image
I came in the game with a name
I was given from a mayn who ain't give a fuck about his children
I proclaim the name though, never in vain no
Watch the change grow 
A young nigga who done gained from fame, copped the Range Ro' 
Now they want my brains on the main road
But they don't understand what I came for
How I came forth with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Gettin' money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, a coffin's the routes I go
O, that's the road you on, oh no
I'm down for the rightful tone of fo' fo'
Don't ever try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you want to catch me at Sunoco
Show me that you're loco, put holes in my photo
Nope! Hope!, hold toast, no jokes, send slugs through your Polo
Just cause our thug roll solo
Impose on grown folk, be a cold negro
Below, your grieved up people
Believe that the boy see no evil

[Chorus]
Ohh! I had you yellin' out when I bag the 30/30 Rifle
Ohh! Too late for niggaz to get religious and start readin' they Bible
Ohh! See you get down like other niggaz repeatin' the dirty cycle
Ohh! See you should make peace instead of makin' me become a psycho

I visualized it, O. Trice at twenty five survived it
Bright but violent, invite the violence
Fist fight a fireman, be a tyrant
'Til these niggaz nights is silent
O. Trice from a trife environment
He 'Roc's the Mic' no sight of retirin'
Maybe when the bank account's like Leviathan then
I'm in position to hire other clients then
Meanwhile I'm a virus like Iverson
A nigga crossover, Europeans admirin'
And the soldier's retirin', I ain't buyin'
Motherfuckers actin like you denyin' them
Who tryin' a nigga, who use buyers
I figure your crew tired, my trigger introduces violence
Dudes through sirens, you in hospital, orange juice and vitamins

[Chorus]

A derelict who inherited hustle
My heritage married the street struggle
Like a couple of a great unk's ago (yeah)
So this blood streams through my nuts
Seems like I wasn't in touch 
When the teacher's ass spoke (nope) 
Naw I was just a preacher in oath
Sit on the bleachers and flip coke
The only reachin' got through my dome
Niggaz yaffle so the gat'll be chrome
Pulled the winnin' raffle so I scramble with a track and the foams (woo)
Fuck a act and a clone, this is actual happening's that's factual back in my home
This is rap, but I ain't rappin so you clap in the zone
Think you're trapped in the act, for the sake of performin' (nigga)
This is your warnin', run up on the wrong 
And your tissue is burning a hundred degrees warm 
O. Treezy's gone, my nigga Bust bring the hook back here for 'em
C'mon

For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
'cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speakin wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster beat on himself
I see you D-12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me

You'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the debt

Niggaz is so gangsta, niggaz is thugs
Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggaz came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, 'cause them niggaz just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggaz get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggaz get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughin' all the way to the bank
Watchin the satellite from a Bentley
You niggaz don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin
The media just feeds into these feuds
Tryin to add fuel to the fire. This little nigga, Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gonna slap me. Nigga please
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview em
All they doin is making fake threats to us through em
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passes
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin your ass
You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your ear? I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryin to be tough, nigga, you look like a asshole

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?

The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
'cause niggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 4 5 will cease the speech
Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets? I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them wit you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the women and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis, pull your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off. Damn
And quit tellin all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we send Stan to come murder your bitches

I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw a Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite here to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player, who workin' with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait, let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Until your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
Come on

Motherfucker!, Benzino!, They don't know we finna' blow!
Someone better tell them so

You don't me, McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few, and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most potest' ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, actin' like they ain't did shit
When you rappin' never mix business up with your friendship
If you lackin' up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automaticly get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with see-4
These hoe's, have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keepin' .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
'Cause I'm coo-coo, But I don't think niggas can take in heat tho'

See I'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew and crew was loyal to you


I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, use twelves and supersonic 
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to nuns and wife's
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D'
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wilding in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get you're fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house
Next day, I'll pee in you're mouth.

Aiyyo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You want to' be an exeption
That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping
With that 'caine in you're left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and
Have you on bare breast
Questionin' you're affection for streets

One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection
Lil' homey that know sowly that loyalty is reckin'

Which one of you niggas want to be abolition bump heads
When I got a passion for clappin', with one hand
Talent's on my roster this mobster's in dump land
Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds
Never leave the crib without packing my black burner
On some T. Ali rapper to merk a have murder
Incorporated, Hitman Harry is at you're service
Reach for me one more gain' and that's closed
For life as D12, no ice and spreewells

Knowing I can be killed
Leaving my group, pieces of proof with a reason to shoot
And a license to ill
We lost Bugz and I'll be damned if we loose another man from our clan
Without forcing our hand
Escorting you're family, I'll torture you're granny

Knocking teeth in back of you're throat (and break you're jaw bone)

Obie Trice,"If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

(Yeah right bitch, Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit

Right now that's all I'm on

I've had a headache for the last three days
And the last couple days I been missing some pay
Do I have AIDS? I'm sniffing and coughing
And really this doesn't happen too often

Maybe I'm tripping, maybe I got the flu
Maybe I'm stressed out, something I'm going through
It's been a week and me and wife ain't have sex
I'm usually a wild guy, I'll break her fucking neck

I'm sick and I'm starting to whimper
It's ninety degrees, it's like December
My temperature is hundred and six
I can't shit and I feel like shit

I took a shit in my white underroos
My eyes look like I been smoking crack
Exlax got me throwing up Big Macs

Nyquil, Advil, Tylenol, Sinus
Carrying my break around like I'm Linus
Maybe it's the pork that I ate in New York
Or maybe my baby mama wanting child support

Or maybe it's the fish that made me sick
Or maybe it's the prostitute I let suck my dick
Or maybe it's just the bottle of vodka

But I couldn't resist the switch
She's the type of bitch made to flinch

Walk passed niggas all in the ass
Or it's because I had a tall glass
I dropped my drawers without my dick wrapped
Perhaps I could catch the crabs

But at that moment that's irrelevant
I knew what I know now, I practice celibacy
And be hesitant from tapping Evelyn
Heaven sent a message when I came back negative
Never fuck a bitch in the ass off a laxative

Right now that's all I'm on

Obie Trice,"[Intro]

[Guard:] Mr. Yayo, your free to go, so I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow
[Eminem:] Guess who's home? Tony Yayo, Obie Trice, c'mon!

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

[Verse 1 - Tony Yayo]

I'll poke you man I'm Riker's Island Pokemon
I got C.O.'s bringin me Filet Mingon
But now a nigga home looking frail in a drop
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got glocks in the lex so we ride behind cops
On broke days we used to put water in our cereal
Now we crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montano, full body armor
Soning niggas like Alfredo in the Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
In the A-are 15, Bentley or Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]

Since Yayo is home, them A-are's is drawn
Obie's guerrilla-Unit, fuck affilia-tion
We are one, it is sensless, for you to prevent this
The 40, cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant, another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperament
And we holding them K's that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, Our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils, baby blues
His short fuses, put your portrait on the news
Nigga them screws is loose when you fucking with them shady dudes

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

[Verse 3 - Tony Yayo]

Got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back itchy fingers on the mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get fifty's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for pamper money
Move like Kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony you all know me
See me on MTV I'm a parole
I was out for 12 hours and went right back in
For three hots and 1 cot doin time in the pen

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

And I ain't being cocky, if so accept my apology
Except, know I process my thoughts logically
First weeks sales tops the toll from tsunami
But haters like the L, it's the white boy behind me

But you couldn't inhale a flow that's more grimy
It would still prevail if another label sign me
Obie so timely, must Obie remind 'em
The first nigga to shine solo from the place ya find 'em

Native Detroiter, ghetto reporter, hit you wit some
Heavy metal for supporting what ya caught us
A little something different from the homie from Michigan

Don't mean you speak no English
Hop out the car, catch the bus
At least you be established as the man that you are

I hate to take it so far and so tedious
But niggas bleed like bitches, I'm truly believing this
Once a month, they wake up
With a Obie tampon inserted in they nuts

Give em the flux 'cause my bucks is up
And no this ain't eBay, so please be easy

Now ya mans living a inch from truly killing 'em
A dude or ambition, a gift, given from the man who invented 'em
When the system scrooged just like Lil' Tim and Em'

Will bless the child who maneuvers the censors, then
Spitting venom, have them same dudes interested in him

Obie Trice,"Niggas didn't kill me
Now a niggas gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?

Get yo ass off the wall with your two left feet

Gun to the passenger for actin' tough

I echo through your external vibe
With internal experiences I've acquired (uhh)
I'm probably the most honest hip-hopper alive

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that ""Renegade"" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him ""suck my dick""
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit

From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens

What's my name? You know that, what's yours? Never mind
Girl get ya behind in my ride and let's glide on 24's
I'm up in the club with a bottle of bub
Got a model and I double up, and you know it's like that
They wanna give a nigga the goods, wanna give the goodies up
And make for a night cap, tell me what excite that
With that nice ass, make a nigga say ""gon' girl""
Make a nigga wanna put you on chrome, take a bitch home
Get it on toes curl, why don't come and hop in O's world
Got the old school parked in the back where the gats at
Where the yack's at, access, got 'em on the way to the mattress
Pass that, toting hey in the vehicle, two broads with no bras
No draw's, no flaws, nope no law, I dips out in the car like what?

Got a gang of bitches, getting them riches, sitting on 24's
Living that life those, that chrome always rolling different from yours
Slow ya role, you know them po po love to get a nigga in a Chevrolet fo' do'
But I get so low, so low low, so low on them ho's

Dipping through the hood on them thangs with a full tank
Gotta pull rank, with my hand on that 45, fuck what a fool think
Try to take a nigga life when the night come, I'm a light some up like a flare gun
Nine millimeter bare bellum, holding a melon, nigga at the right one
Now a niggaz on the right hunt, got a nice type honey and we into seeing ice and
Bitches wanna get the right come, Trice is the type that lay pipe like python
Parallel to a pipe line, carousel kinda clockwise, switch 'em in and outta my ride

Hop in the tre-nickle-o-six-four, AC blow, you be nice and cold
Ice on my neck like zero below, she zero in on O, nigga froze a ho
Pedal to the medal, we off to the mo', bitch get sentimental, fuck the ho
Got an issue, he ain't gon' miss you, gotta shit slew of bitches, wishing to fit ya shoes
Ridiculous how I give 'em exit wounds, disrespect, singing an O sex tune
That's a bet, better yet, Dev is next, get her in the bed and her head is Pez
Best believe that I'm wearing the dress, panties wet, got her in the fanny yep

I'd like to reintroduce myself, ha ha
If you don't know by now. It's Obie Trice man

I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo
Made up my monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa
Hated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the pig fo' rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils
Gotta eat you, be cool, got a kid to feed that'll reach you
Or did it see through? Or do I just speak through the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel
When niggaz on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cot when they caught by the cops
Young Tupac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm

Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it, now I spit it

Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on
Trying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga that's trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'ma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me
But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see
I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe since burst on the scene, I'm a be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'm a get this cheese and that's why he's

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga, listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious
Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit

And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

Yeah
Things change man
You know, get a chance to travel
See the world and you start to look at things a lil different

You don't want it with us nigga, we strapped with nitroglycerin
Our ambitions is some riders, thriving off poor decisions
A blessing nigga still living, still pimping, still visions of
Sitting in that foreign whip, whipping up cola take a lick
To my tongue, numb from the shit
My nuts hung since I was a young one
And that's just the slum fuck of it
I'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm
My momma can't save me her gender is wrong
On my own in this jungle that niggaz call home
What? His momma died from a lump in her D cup
Police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks
It's like a habitual situation, we stuck
The ritual is for niggaz to grab they nuts
And just soak all this bullshit up, where I'm from?

[Chorus]

I'm from real bridge cause, for niggaz living hard
Welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad
Pimping the government cause government pimping us
Rather see 'em suffering then niggaz live it up
Cause you ain't heard? Bird got birds
But the nigga got murd' cause niggaz felt he ain't deserve
What he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf
He was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody
I'm from the streets where most these niggaz nutty
I adapt to em, I'm exactly in tuned with 'em
Strapped with the Mac that extract flesh from humans
Home sweet home, better known as The Ruins

Her voice maneuvers, got me thinking bout her day to day
See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say
Put on the dance floor and play with Obie
And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake
So she pon'd the river her way of doing the snake
Jamaican God, make a true playa break
Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate
Incense lit when she's interested in insertion
Any minute ya squirting, she gifted in
Giving you the business, hurting em

You know a nigga wanna touch your body
We can keep in touch, have an after party
You know you wanna fuck 'cause you're acting naughty
You see us in the mattress probably

Wanna be involved 'cause the entourage I'm indulged in
You say you love my dirty drawers, you're all in
Wanna sleep with the star, be baby moms, eat lobster
See where you're coming from

'Cause hey, that nigga got dick for days
And ain't too many niggas blessed in O?s ways I guess
I just get better with old age
'Cause in my hey, puss made me say ?Mayday?

Anyway, today I'm a different human being
I crush 'em, make 'em scream
It's nothing, ain't a thing
Fronting like the dick ain't off the chain
Slicing nigga?s [incomprehensible], c'mon

At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body

Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll

At the after party, it?s a private party
What happens at the party, stays at the party

Girl go on and party, back up that body into my body, girl let's go

You know I'm somewhere where I can ease my mind be
On some island Don Ps beside me
No paparazzi eying that hiney
But I am right behind she

Wanna bump 'n grind, crying, sayin' I'm all up in that side
Bringing down the menstruation cycle
Girl I lay pipe to the right, pipe to the left
Pipe all night, a pipe dream, right?

O Trice advice your type
If it ain't him, it?s a nigga in my click you like
If the misses insist on a dick tonight
We throw assists like Scott Pip and Mike

You blow a kiss on my tip you just might
Get a whiff of the kid up in your windpipe
Now see that insight? It excites
'Cause she's undressing for that sex, right?

Take time off my hectic schedule
Just to give you the pleasure you request for
When I hit your spine that's how you measure O
Tell your girlfriends you ain't had it like this before

Now your girlfriends all up in the midst of O
Wanna be mistress, all 'cause a few extra inches
Blew back your interest, you lack experience
New jack my crew ran through that for instance

We can fuck from dusk to dawn
'S no discussion whose nuts you're on
To me she's such in a rush to cum
Wanna choke on the dong, like it?s a bong

And what is he doing? You're making her moan
You make her wanna leave that muthafucka she got back home
All O knowing is he keeps hoes going, enjoying O Trice?s groin

They say why you so defensive? I take that offensive
Comin' from the shit that I lived in
You wouldn't understand him unless you eye witness
Chillin' on the block where vacant lots are given

These niggas hit up sittin' down at some center
Get a kite with a flick of a chick, he once hit up

On the corner from dusk to dawn
Till that shit whites brought to America's gone
Be a good Samaritan, my heritage was did wrong
So all that sufferin' that's just prolong

Long as you knowin' that strong arm robbery
Was brought on from this society deprivin' me
This brings violence if you're not survivin'

I assume I'm valuable, they throwin' in the towel
Bow whenever they see him rollin' at diablo

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life
You niggas don't know me
You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong
",Mama,2006
Obie Trice,"Momma's so proud of you, you did so good on that report card today baby
I'mma let you pick out whatever you want
Ma, I can get any shoes I want?
That's right, today is your day
Momma don't have much, but I'll spend it all on you today
Okay, I want these. Ah man, I'mma look fresh when I go to school

Such a beautiful thing, being embraced by a woman that's a queen
With big dreams for the younger sibling
O couldn't do no wrong
According to report cards Obie brought home
They say good in spelling
Spelling bee's always excelling
Which was so overwhelming that Momma took him shopping
Copped him the new Jay's
Swear to God homie this was Obie's cool days
BMX'ing up the block with the tennant living next to him
Shooting hopes, who got hops?
Worthy, when he pop a jump shot
No worries, just a pocket full of sugar or whatnot
Hit the candy house on the block
It was pickle in them spot
Then things turn around when Obie'll lay down
Hear the sounds of fire rounds surrounded em
Astounded him, the volume of the blast had me so interested
Momma falling with cash, she can't get a nigga in this bitch
They wanna hit the ass, nigga start ditching class
Dad ain't around, he left a nigga 
Sagging in them Superman drawers that one Saturday
Is it my fault, shit got dark?
Mom and I fall apart, relationship taunts, bad talk
""Can't stand you, looking like ya Daddy with that same walk""
Muthafucka you 
Now a niggas out in the streets
Two nickle plated thirty-eights on me
Can't stay away from beef
Scrapping with them niggas from the other side
Sipping Saint Ives rocking old school flannels
Old school niggas see that I'm an animal
Front me at 16, see how my roll handle
Now I'm up the O's but wait on the affy
'cause here come my muthafuckin baby, cool
Had to slow my role
Plus my P.O. got a nigga pissing in a bowl
Hold my temperament 'cause I see such innocence
When I'm looking in Kobe's pupils
Despite all the dope I sold I had to change my road
I just might be able to grow old
Older brother said, ""Yo O 
I'mma quit my job so we can chase our goals
I'll be manager-a-go, you can rap I suppose""
That's what we did, I still flipped a little bit
Saved up my chips and put it into music
""Well Known Asshole"" a underground hit
Still scrambling, looking like shit
Baby momma think I'm smoking more then a spliff
Think a blessing came from the man who invented my gift
When Eminem said ""let me hear you spit""
Wrote my signature, now Shady Obie represents
Hit em with the D12 skit
Can exhale now I see my Mom's ain't pissed
She hit em with a smile 'cause Obie became focused
From independent out the trunk like them dope kids
To platinum plaques, world tours, getting noticed
An inappropriate soldier became so ferocious
In this Hip-Hop culture that I long for
The roller coaster O was on so young
Took a turn right into his song
That's right, from after school fights
To pushing white, to pursuing his career heights
One mic's, all I need involved with beats
I'mma be the streets to Jesus, cars on me
And that'll be the day you applaud and see
The underdog gets his eventually

Gotta end it though
I'm all in it, there's no limits
And it's so splendid
Real names, no gimmicks
No image, just a soldier who spoke what he lived
From the ribs with it, the flows vintage
Obie gotta do this for real
Yeah

Gotta get it at a good rate, get bucks, come home with the weight up!

Dippin' now, in the CAL, get Dre on the phone,
Gotta put that fluff on hold, homegrown, holmes know,
Bubonic chronic gots to move on it soon as possible

Reclinin', just a couple of folks reload from the West to the East coast,
Gotta get that dough, flip them bows, get back to the 'Mo like pronto
With guacemole, niggaz can't grow these, got it where they make nacho,

Obie Trice [Verse 1]: 
It's risky, the b**** tend to rise out a n**** 
It's history, Snitch, who decided he's a member 
Once he got pinched, coincided with law 
Same homie say he lay it down for the boy 
Brought game squad around ours 
How could it be? Been homies since Superman draws 
Only foniness never came to par 
He had us, a true neighborhood actor 
Had his back with K's 
Now we see through him like X-Ray's 
Cuffed in that Adam car 
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war 
Knowing not to cross those resevoir dogs 
You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable 
When we invest in team, it's to the death fo sho 
No ex and oh's, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca

Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's 
Recondences when we peep enemies on us 
Been on these corners, sellin like anything on us 
Knowing heaven has shown us being devil's minors 
That ain't got s*** to do with the tea in China 
We gon keep the grind up til death come find us 
Meanwhile leanin in them European whips reclined up 
It's an eye for an eye for the riders 
We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors 
Po Pos is cowards, there's no you, it's ours 
We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder 
Who woulda known he would fold and cower 
Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds 
So no exs and ohs, tex calicos

So he move to a rural area to keep cool 
He snitchin on a snitch now, there's nothin to tell 
Nowadays, your circles should be small as hell 
Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me 
Even if we bubble slow, we'll get it eventually 
No penitentary, there will be no climacy 
You will meet the lowest snitch in given us a century 
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon 
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on em 
Stop snitchin, you asked for the life your living 
This act is not permitted, Nowhere on the map, It is 
Forbidden to send a n**** to prison if you been in it 
Along with em and then snitch and become hidden 
So it's no exs and ohs, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca

Aye em you ready? 
Herk, you got them thangs nigga? 
You know
Detroit city

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

You are not convincin'
When detroit blocks stay flocked with henchman
Niggas get popped for instance
Infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pension
Straight detention, a nigga doin' tension
Once released, he on that music business
Been viewin' 106 in them cafeterias
Only to find that raps actually serious
Deliriously so its back to crack and vigilance
Same shit to send them up in michigan
Us is pimpin', a difference from any city I've visited
Its that detroit spirit and if we in it
Ballin' out to the end, period
Use o' as the reference to that sentence
The message I'm sendin', you best just pay attention

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me
Now run my chips before we fall out like shaq and kobe
Big herk on a track with obie
When you come to the d, its cut throat, better be packin' homie
And niggas get they shit split for actin' phony
We're known for the glocks and the choppers
These niggas will rob you, leave you standin' in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real g's and lots of imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rosters
Y'all niggas ain't impress me yet
Y'all yappin', not rappin', turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, runnin' from the narcos
Keep them bottles comin', we gon' pop 'em till the bar close

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

Meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass
She had dreams of being an r&b singer
Diva, leave her face cut up from the waist
Of me, what a waste of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, its just straight gangster
It ain't just new york or la that bangs no more
There's latin crown kings here, southside folk
Eastside them gangs and nothin' but gang lands and
Spray paint cans and when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancin'
That window rolls down and that trey . 8's dancin'
And them shooters don't miss homie, man they hate chancin'
Its straight for the dome and its vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashin'
Red and blue lights, no ambulance you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no detroit anthem
But just so you know if you see them d-boyz passin'

There they go

",Violent,2006
Obie Trice,"They say he was a monster from birth, so
Fuck it, I'll just a lean warn-os them hoes
I suppose O took on the street life
Even though my mother told me I could be otherwise
Wasn't the school type, I was too cool
My agenda wasn't general education, nigga
Generalizing Obie's expectations
It was like, a cucoo in twenty-twos
Bad news my nigga, pass the brew
Cause in a week we be pouring a glass for you
So rapidly homies become causualties
We was just playing Madden
Now a nigga sad for his family, that's how it happens
Dudes get blasted, another casket
Another child becomes a fatherless bastard
Make a nigga wanna grab this rachet
It's so tragic, and Obie can't get past it
And you wonder why a nigga'll flash it
Just to, show these demons that I ain't having it
Put 'em beneathe the grass in a flash
Homie I'm from the craft
And to make it where I'm at, that's called Soldierism
Real niggaz notice em, they wanna flow with 'em
Wanna do major shows with 'em
Get the fuck out the ghetto wit 'em
Heavy metal, leave a nigga twisted, don't fret
This is the set we live in
But I ain't crying or whining about my environment
Even though black folk is dying constant
Niggaz'll shoot you unconscious
Wit no conscience, until you lose conscience
Conscious, and pompous white folk think I'm just rhyming
Just designing lines, just for the sake of shining
Like I just speak violent applying to the business I'm in
Rewind and find him in a dirty ass hood with no sight of climbing
Moving on up was just The Jeffersons
Rest of us watching the tube got less then them
So why you vexing him? Why you stretching him out?
He got the weapon all because his whereabouts
Born and raised, mental slaves
And I don't see change before I'm seeing the grave
All I see is my homies corpse decay
Crying at his wake, can't recognize his face
Face it, you not identifying with me
My identity distorts ya visibility
So you can't see me, peep what he's achieving
You receive information from TV
I'm in the hood, I live it you read about it
Rest in peace Peezy
Please believe Obie eyes've seen The Wire
Prior to what you seeing on the screen
I done been in and out of the bing
Lost niggaz to unfortunate things
That's why, praise the Lord I'm still on the scene
Praise the Creator who made human beings
Just for creating a nigga like me
A nigga that put the umph in G, yeah

[Chorus 2X]
Wake up
I try to reach out but you won't
Wake up
My brothers and sisters, we got to
Wake up
'Fore you stuck in the system, and then ya
Wake up
Reality hits ya, before you can
Wake up

Yea he provoke him, to pull up out his holster
Leave you wit a visible ulcer, oggle and off ya

Whether see 'em suffer, then become one up on us
Round the globe, promotin us hustlas
The white boy's cool, but refuse they brothers
So we, cock the tools, and shoot our own color
This ain't Detroit Red, you won't (X) me out (Malcolm)
I exit this, whenever be from a violent outcome
I turn Exorcist on niggas wit extra clips
Exit on my ethics, is no longer present
X-rays show, I was this close to Heaven
So for future reference, I stay this close to a weapon {click-clack}
Who you testin, never said I was the best, never stressin'
Don't make me get in my zone, I will own that whole note (fa sho')

Can't explain the gift; but my aim is to take

And I ain't evaporate, I will remain the shit
So ya lames that got a problem wit the game - tough tit
He still in the same Range, windows fixed
And I'm killin' 'em come a-gain, that's as real as it gets
Off ya, tryna make me depart ya, from my thought-a
Coffin's for you, and the nigga that brought ya
The hatin' start in ya, release from our father
The people at the alter, saying ya better off
You don't wanna see a demon, come out of a humen being
Recent being the sience, and to him it's too extreme
Catch me in the BM, like Tupac and them
Or in that Tahoe like Christopher, no
Poppa gon' keep poppin' Cris on you hoes
And piss on those, who exist as my foes
O rolls through shit, spittin' cold flows
Knows his business, I'll be missed if I go
Who you know holdin' the city on his shoulders

Prepare for a player, who workin' with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait, let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Until your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
Come on

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
And she caught me starin'
And my homies darin' me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla 'cause I got a lot of DeNiro (DeNiro)
The DJ's playin' Obie's song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't want to be headin' home
With some double D's full of silicon
Ten hood rat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin' ""off to they rides!""

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep

Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally
Like a box of Cherrios
Carry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses petite, no window drapes

Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Oprah and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Obie Trice,"Hit him up two times
Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

Got the crack, put in your orders
We ’bout to run up out the stores
It’s notorious, the way I got big spitting stories
Being me’s X-Clan, Vanglorious
We’re not your favorite, fuck it
You know the system and you buck it
Have you revisiting how you used to love it
A nigga spew through the music, acoustics, cool kid
Used to pursue excuses, truth is, I was truent in school
So its influence is foolish, that was my views
I’m back at it, the rap addict, by any means
We gon get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain’t a star, niggas might be right
I’m so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight
Take it back Selektah, let ‘em know it’s Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon’ ride tonight

And I would like to introduce myse-self
Surprise! Hi, it’s Ike
‘Bout to get my Ike on, I come with a life supply
Of wife beaters and my Nikes on
And a white tee over that Iron Mike
Lookin’ fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, Park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin’ like she got fuckin’ higher standards than Meijer’s, right
Had to pry her fingers off the motherfuckin’ Breyer’s ice cream
With the pliers, like “AAHHH!”
Only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothles bitch with no taste buds to Ruth Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home
Pick up two Big Bufords
Girl, you got a nice pair, but you’re plum stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz
Don’t try to pretend you ain’t interested
To impress your stupid ass friends
And refuse to get in woman, and get slammed on the ground
And snap like a pool stick against cement
If you suck of dick, pretend it’s a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you’re a ho
Cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I’m from Detroit city, you livin’ in animosity
That’s a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me
In senseless mind babble, “What me? Apologize? labrbrr”
That’s just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn’t fucking take it back if I time traveled!

Just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
It’s also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
You ain’t gotta be no detective to figure out I’m a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue
Sherlock, prick! Just call me Richard

That’s my motives, jumpin’ out them Rovers
All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas
Or Minnesota, did I mention soda?
When it’s mixed with viola, watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier
Them ho niggas disposable toaster
Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
Being me till the credits roll
Till my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O
Like a prosthetic third leg let it go
This is Shady 1.0 Em let ‘em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans my balls’ll never digress
I’m a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast and then I drag it out
World, I be your special friend see
Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo penis envy

I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me

And it's getting fourty past the hour

Through the window

And I know golden June
Can turn an empty gray
Against your window

If I walk by the trees
I'll catch the falling leaves
If the wind blows

But I know all this means is
Whiling on the hours
Watching sideshows

And I feel like I'm on the outside
Of the circle

Will I turn my coat to the rain
I don't know
But I'm going somewhere I can warm my bones

Fare you well I'll carry me away
And sing to those I know
Upon their birthdays

Whiling just an hour away
Looking at the trees on the roadside
Feeling it's a holiday
You and I should ride the coast
And wind up in our favourite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song
Like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

Oh oh la la
Oh oh la la
Oh oh la la

And told a dirty joke
Walking like Groucho, sucking on a number ten
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in
I'll miss the crush and I'm home again

Whiling just an hour away
Step into the sky in the star bright
Feeling it's a brighter day

And Monday she'll go down town standing naked in the road
You may know what I am
But who I am you don't know

She'll run across the mustard dust sand
Scream down the wind
And the sea is in a cold
Like when in holiday homes
And houses like sweet confectionery
And sandcastles and drinking wine
Hungry dinners perfectly timed

And mother and father glowing young
Happy to be each other together
When she blows the candle out
She goes to bed and lies and drags through her head
The day that went way of every day
But tomorrow she'll fly a plane
Over the fields where the houses aren't built yet

She smiled sweetly across the room
Through the lunch time smoke
And I loved her for a second
And discarded the queen and I know
How sweetness turns sour
And leaves they turn to brown
And then to earth and dust
And settle in this town
You get blown away...

Sitting on our fences
Building up defenses
Making up rules by which we play

We're just half way down the road
Staking our positions
But stupid superstitions
Only give fools too heavy a load

The magpie screeched and my window is shattered
Her body's bruised but her soul's not battered
The fireman tried but the hose was frozen
The cupboard's bare but the door needs closing

We spend half our time away
From being where we want to
And seeing who it's fun to
Not blaming ourselves for our mistakes

We spend half a dream away
Just looking out of windows
Waiting for a signal
Waiting for night to return to day

The tree was bare but the birds were singing
The milk turned sour but my thirst needs quenching
The meat was dead and I need me feeding
The room was cold but the night was freezing

The rainbow frowned when the sun was shining
A baby's snatched on a beautiful morning
A dog runs wild and the brakes are screaming
A church on fire is struck by lightning

The princess frowned at her lovers mistress
She went insane and poisoned the children
A teacher's drowned and a child is laughing

Oceanlab,"Across the Eerie waters
Misty covered glass I spied
A sad procession, snaking down
The dry and deathly trail
And as my telescopic eye
Focused on the marching line
It settled on the fallen crown
Now covered with a veil

The heavy weight of mourning
Drew each head to face the ground
Muscles tight on bearers' arms
Each body cold and frail
And through the muslin mist
The beating drums, the only sound
Twenty boats out in the bay
All ready to set sail

Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst
Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst

My bones soaked in the icy cold
And fixed me where I lay
Until each vessel left the shore
And made a line for me
There never was a breeze
The leaves were silent all that day
They say the sails were ghosts
That stole the wind to set them free

I layed transfixed
Felt nothing, but the beating of my fear
As flames rose up and swallowed whole
Greatest of the fleet
The others circled round
And I heard chanting fill the air
The ashes, lifted high
Were falling back into the sea

Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst

Misty covered glass I spied
A sad procession, snaking down
The dry and deathly trail
And as my telescopic eye
Focused on the marching line
It settled on the fallen crown
Now covered with a veil

The heavy weight of mourning
Drew each head to face the ground
Muscles tight on bearers' arms
Each body cold and frail
And through the muslin mist
The beating drums, the only sound
Twenty boats out in the bay
All ready to set sail

Ashes take me back to earth
Water quench my human thirst
Ashes take me back to earth
Water quench my human thirst

My bones soaked in the icy cold
And fixed me where I lay
Until each vessel left the shore
And made a line for me
There never was a breeze
The leaves were silent all that day
They say the sails were ghosts
That stole the wind to set them free

I layed transfixed 
Felt nothing, but the beating of my fear
As flames rose up and swallowed whole
Greatest of the fleet
The others circled round
And I heard chanting fill the air
The ashes, lifted high
Were falling back into the sea

And there's nobody to blame fuck it blame yourself

Like a nuclear staying how you write in a cell
You just better pray a liar and hope you prevail

This petty world a kill me slowly take away my grandma mami hold me

Written between the paper line examples of my lifestyle
So read inside the guidelines ain't no sunshine

That you don't believe in God

I look around and all my friends are gone

Would you be me?
Cause I would be you
You'd be happy if you wanted to
Would you trade me?
Cause I would trade you
You'd be happy if you wanted to

How do you tell your father
That you want him to notice you
Why does it seem like such a bother?
When Mom says â??He'd be better off deadâ??
But I want to see you
I still want to see you
Would you call me?
It's not hard to
I'm the first one, you gave birth to
Would you write me
On my birthday?
Graduation was yesterday
How do you hold the special victim?
When they push you away
When they've been
Raped on the inside
Torn on the outside
Feel dirt and ugly
From the strain that they try to hide
Touched in private places
Embarrassed faces
Too scared to ask for helpâ?¦why?

I'll remind you that you're strong

If I could, I would love you as you are
Take you inside, into my heart
Into my arms, into my life",If I Could,1995
October Project,"In this dream of life and death, I know so much, I will forget 
I know your body and your breath, I know your rhythm and your touch 
I want you here, I want so much, I fear too much 
Far too human to let go, I fight the river and the flow 
I fight the love and the fear, I do not want to leave you here 
In one body you appear, in this dream 

I dream and I still want so much to touch the inside 
I dream and I still want to stay inside this dream with you 

Now I know that every dream begins with you, and ends in time 
Now I know that maybe I am too alive 
If I could speak in tongues of flame, I'd burn forever with your name 
And take it with me through all time 
I would remember who you are, in every life I'd touch your heart, in 
every dream 

I dream and I still want so much to touch the inside 
I dream and I still want to stay inside this dream with you",One Dream,1995
October Project,"When the darkness falls like a curtain
And the night ahead is a long and uncertain dream
Beyond the loss and the hope of redemption)

At the broken heart of the city
Where the hollow light of day never reaches in
A man can break down and fall into pieces
He will fall asleep like a baby
And the unforgiving arms of the cradle
Rock as hard as the face of the city pavement
Hide your eyes
Hide your eyes

He can see the face of a lover
In the lonely face of the angel above him
Carved into the stone that is changing around him
He can feel her breathing inside him
And the unforgiving visions deny him
Life can only be what a man can make it
Hide your eyes
Hide your eyes

Sunday morning
Yellow sky
The sun is floating diamond high
Hours passing
A baby cries
In the arms of someone you imagine
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby

He can feel his skin like a prison
Like a dying cage he struggles to live inside
He tries to call out but nobody hears him
At the ragged edge of the silence
In the calm that only comes with the violent sleep
Inside the heart and the hope of redemption
Hide your eyes
Hide your eyes

In the heart of someone you imagine
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby

Would the fall never come to an end?
Wonder how many miles I've fallen
Must be somewhere near the centre of the earth

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Would the fall never come to an end?)",Sunday Morning Yellow Sky,1995
October Tide,"I painted with rain the sight of the daybreak, 
As being in need of a momentary remake 
The life I am leading is the way of depravity, 
A threat to my already poisoned sanity 

Grey dawn, everlasting 

Hope is utopia for all that I know, 
When counting the seconds time moves so slow 
I can't feel any will to be part of this fight 
A cure is however to put thrust in the night 

I learn from this life to hide from humanity, 
And night has told me how to kill my anxiety 
The ghost of my smile dances in the pale, 
And I know all my efforts most likely will fail",Grey Dawn,1999
October Tide,"It's all painted cold 
I'm not here today 
I'm not here at all

This is not today 

Not even tomorrow",Losing Tomorrow,2008
Octobop,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,2002

Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I have it today and give back tomorrow

It's natural to act bashful in the presence of niggas with cash flow
I spaz ho, laying somehwhere close to where the grass grows
Listening to jazz' cause these niggas mad trash, yo
And that, kicking dust, my shit is ridiculous
Quickly put my dick in sluts who nose tend to be sticking up
Silly niggas, give it up, no person is sick enough
The doctor needs to fix me up, fix me up
Miss nurse in the red shirt, I'mma need some fucking head work
Talk you into anything, with talking, I'm an expert
Just talking to you niggas and it's sounding like my best work
Best work? For now, yes With every drop I'm better
Better than the rest, these niggas apply pressure
These niggas, every verse is lyrically def to these niggas
When that hearse drop, 6 feet death for you niggas
Many men opposing me, no success for you niggas
And I'm still on my bullshit, loc'ing with a full clip
That's the iPhone full of verses that I could spit
Preaching to the real, why he standing at the pulpit
Throwing middle fingers at the haters like, ""what's good, bitch?""

Nah, really, what's trilly hood, bitch?
Hair, nigga extra mayo
That's the Frigidaire billionaire Bruce Wayne flow

Should be back at your place, just being patient with your feet up
They say he's so chill, how does he show no stress?
He can't see into the future, how does he know what's next?
Seeing all of these steps that he's taking
You're mistaken if they say we ain't so complex
I'm tryna be in a blue coupe, you can't pronounce the name
With a bad yellow bitch and she's singing Purple Rain, so insane

And people talking down on me, I don't really think they should
They said they could do it better, I don't really think they could
I ain't one for niggas wishes, but I wish a nigga would
This ain't as easy as it looks, I just make it look good

What does it mean if I think I'm the one these niggas can't see?
Gang mentality, Odd Future is a family
My niggas thrash, I was always Anti, Plan-B
Did I lose you? I know I'm much more than you're used to
Now I got these girls stepping out from their usual
So they tune in, T.I., see I, realize I'm a stand up guy
And these niggas realize they can't stand to see me on TV
So they lose their footing like they were gluttons with diabetes
But fuck the bullshit, I'm just tryna get rich

Black kid on the corner selling drugs, go figure
Salute them with 21 guns, I'm killing these niggas

'Cause a fake nigga in his death bed will be fuckin' collaboratin'
Kush escaped without a roller, high roller, no time for strollers
Made it stoned because I'm workin' over, too many posers tryin' to rob my bowl
I'm pretty sure Tyler will represent it, I fell asleep before you bitch niggas present it
I'm fuckin' authentic, remember it, you motherfuckers pretending

Me and Leggo just skate at the mall

I had a dead phone so I gave that little nigga my cam
He snapped that shit, the motherfuckers went HAM
Like Miss Piggy cunt around Kermit
I'm like how many fucks can I get a day?
Fuck respect, I'd rather hang myself on the wall with a noose on neck
Before I change to fit in your block, so I'll make sure I cannot fit in a house
And I hate genres, fuck hip hop with their searching cop high top flip flops
In the middle of the winter, y'all like fuck them kids, like a weird babysitter might say
No diggity, I'm still tryin' to find it but I lost it somewhere in Austin
In a creek with Dawson and this vegan bitch tryin' to eat my sausage
That sounds awesome
Fuck these parties, I'm real awkward
I stand there, I don't know what to do man
I'd rather be at home with my crew and my new rooms, staring at my brand new MoonMan

Hodgy Beats, Odd Future, Golf Wang nigga, but there's more of us
Coroner's out when they're killing the gorgeous
Diamond cut like what the fuck is flawless?
Tell the runner to go and get me some go
'Cause I'm bubblin' on you horrors
I'm such a mystery
Mystery is more quite than a hipster Prius takin' a trip to Egypt
Niggas claim to be scenic when I know they ain't seen shit
I see shit fuckin' seasick, rain showers is what I predict
My flow is like gymnastics, so
Beef flips, patty cakes, smoke a pound of dro for the algae taste
Say what up to my pinky, say hi to my index
Fuck all the hoes want middle finger, thumb take shots like a pentax
Bitch I kill 'em all, you could just write off they're death tax
Boxin' niggas out of the mic, punch lines, death match

I invented swag, fuck what these other niggas talkin' 'bout
Niggas wanna brag 'bout the shit that they lack
But the truth of the fact, it's all word of mouth
Talk a lot of crap, but ain't shit for sure
Bathin' Ape shit that I get for low
I don't pay much and I don't say much
But I still got a swag you should get to know
I flip a show, spend it on apparel
Spanish bitch tell me I look mucho dinero
Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yea
Doper than the 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps

You feel me, son? Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyon, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awk

Big eared bandit is tossing all his manners
In a bag and wrapping them in seran wrap bandages
Tossing 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says ""Catch up, nigga"" it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowing you own your opponent is a defeating bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers
Dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went jousting
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbin' in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealing your rings
Coke diamonds and your Vet, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when you shoot you gon' poop
It's kill Hodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryin' to smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talkin' 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
Livin' like the Mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters actin' up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave you flossin' and cause exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealin' home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreamin' of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hangin' the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catchin' matinees, huh?
I'm gettin' blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say ""get 'em Mike G"" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glock
Now I'm all grown, sing songs just to give 'em watts
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than the otter pop
Op Dom neck shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff out of this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bye, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fuckin' crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the fogs
Down in Muscle Beach pumpin' iron and bone
Bumpin' oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumpin' oldies off my cellular phone

Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here I go

Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang

Yeah, fuck that, look, the contrast is a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fires to sheriffs whips
(Whoosp, whoosp) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit to the lips meet the bottom of a barrel
So that sterile piss flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill apparel, wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko, and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole was numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup, or Nevada
Drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck, shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
I'm roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as the porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass, scorchin' ladies
Motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me with savages, have a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let percocets and xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Naks
Shredding down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape, and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fuckin' beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitching, being mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck

The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African

My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win, killing them all with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling, suit taylor never taddling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like Tetris
Remember me, forgetfulness, I am your correctionist
I stitched odd and future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, If head for less
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch

Let's see, what's wrong with me might be my fucking tourett see
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky,
me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
So finally asked [scratch] when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreative were sampling
I'm wolf, I spit flow-y partly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the odd future motherfucking sargeaning
(Tyler calm the fuck down) No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat
And if another fan asks for a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, OK be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 16's came out of nowhere like your kid's wet dream
What you mean old news, oh you
Will you need us to fucking show you that we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step mom, none of you motherfuckers can fuck with me",P,2012

So you cough and you joke and you slob and you fart
Fuckin round with my coughee, bitch, you better be cautious
Cause hoe, you know I roll big old horse dicks
To keep you blowed higher than giraffe nut
I spend my last ten even if I need a half cut
My girlfriend trippin out she don't understand why
I come in fucked up every night and I

Drink about two or three coughees in the mornin

For comin by the crib when I'm broke to get a nigga full

Around 4 p.m. with this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin with my dick
And I'm constantly askin myself, like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know - damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie

Now it's her things that she's packin
Hey yo baby, apologize, but now I realize, hm, I knew exactly how she felt

She's diggin in my pants, grabbin my nuts like a fuckin squirrel
So what was I to do, me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe, I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak, we would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We gots to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin was funny, so she came home early
And all that moanin and groanin, I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up walkin round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspected there was somethin up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me, she never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin they panties in my bed'

Yeah, I can't believe them niggas up on the ave that tried to get with the
Q to the you to the e-s-t
Down with the O-double to the muthafuckin d
It's like that and it always will
For them niggas who talk that shit, you hoes ain't never seen skills
This ain't no gang or a crew or a high-cappin clique
No combat boots or baggy pants, dreadlocks - none of that shit
So let me hear it one time for the Coughee Brothers (yeah)
Peace to my homies and moms duke, yeah, much love to ya
And one more thing before I'm out
I'm here to let you niggas know I'm down with the Squad

[ Jugg Mugg ]
Well it's the nigga they call the Jugg from the Squad kickin it Odd, shit
You taste it first so that mean you got to pause it
Just a group of real g's who makes you buckle to your knees
I'm pullin swisher sweets from my sleeves
Stuffin it full of coughee every day for the fun of it
I love to clock the paper, get the pussy and get blunted
So listen to the nigga they call the J to the you to the double g
Chillin with these niggas I call my family
That's my brother D who writes the lyrics about the pussy
Next to me is see-Ray with the spliff, now pass it to me
That's my brother Rob Mac who makes the funky fat track
And hey Chris, P-Black who watches a nigga back
And we're the Coughee Brothers, just some down muthafuckas
Whoever possess the sess, yo, we share it with each other
It's like that y'all (that y'all) it's like that y'all (that y'all)
And today I got the dime and it's fat y'all (fat y'all)
I'm with the Squad

[ Devin ]
Well it's the Odd Squad, Jugg Mugg, Devin and Rob
And we're steady gettin drunk on the job
Everybody might know us for smokin that weed and feelin fine
Gettin full, drinkin Bull, buyin dime after dime but it's time
Cause hell, we been writin rhymes since '89
Tell em y'all (yeah, you know we ain't lyin)
But some people say we cuss too much and that is not the way to go
Tellin us to make the album strictly for the radio
But yeah-heh, this just ain't no comedy act
Just some brothers with rubbers stickin they dick in your back
Bitch and don't get offended when there's a different dick in your mouth
Every thirty minutes when you're fuckin with the Squad",Squad,1994
Odd Squad,"Yeah
This goes out to whom it may concern
But anyway
Check it out

Sittin in the next room talkin softly on the telephone
Makin plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a hoe
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peek it, loc, here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think ehm, Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m. with this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin with my dick
And I'm constantly askin myself, like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know - damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin, illin, riffin, trippin, she gave my face a smack
Now she's got a busted lip and says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin
Hey yo baby, apologize, but now I realize, hm, I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin at the crib by my goddamn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin my back tryin to suck my own dick

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin on
Everytime I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin in my pants, grabbin my nuts like a fuckin squirrel
So what was I to do, me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe, I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak, we would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We gots to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin was funny, so she came home early
And all that moanin and groanin, I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up walkin round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspected there was somethin up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me, she never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin and shit when she left at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months and when she call all she do is talk cold to me

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy

Odd Squad,"We need to change our ways
Doin' the same thing we did yesterday
Making beats, getting high
Chasing freaks, feeling fine
Its just the same old shit
But I think we ain't gone quit
Makin' a rhyme, climbing the hill
Staying alive, just tryin' ta live

It's a constant struggle, but brothers gotta keep climbing
People be thinking this shit is simple and simon
Lookin' at my wrist to see the position that I'm in
Kinda clothes I'm wearing, the type of car that I'm drivin'
I been strivin'
With damn near nothing to fight with
Flashlight, nightstick, ain't no blowin' up right quick
Type shit, I just write shit, hopin' it might hit
So I can make a living, but there some who don't like it
But I.. I really don't give a motherfuck 
A nigga's tryin' to get another buck
The legal way that people say what they want em 
But I'm gonna, smoking drinkin' fuck with these freaks
Til I find one life with mona
On a mission 
Every day wishin' and prayin'
can't be kidding and playing
Fast break missing the laying
So what you saying?

Man we need to make these beats, fuck these freaks, fire these sweets

Constantly asking me to change my ways
But the way I'm acting now is the way I'm acting since the first day
But the sumas to Vics smoke blunts significant others man
Ya'll can't stop the jump up for pound with these brothers
It's a rough long climb up the hill to the top
Giving it all that we got 
As we proceed to wreck shop
And it's the same shit, ain't shit changed since 94'
You see the scorn left the scene
And paid the circle back to let you know
Gotta get my paper bro
If I can't I'ma let it do
We coming back for mo, and kicking the hinges off your door.
(kickin the hinges off your door)
And life is so lunt slunt
Reality hits bluntly
Amongst all these issues we grind, cause the rents due monthly
But everything you do is certain consequences
I know there is more than this is a Piz and he's three dimensions
I'm just trying to hold it down and maintain my existence
Lets put something down right here and we can do it with persistence
I'm knowing its real cause I can feel it in the distance (talk to me)
Man listen
Its like old folks that get settle in their ways
And it pays for one to be wise these days
Not afraid
Smoke one is my typical habitual ritual 
That let this music and these words give you a visual
Come Now!

Now I'm just tryin to gain green
(I'm doing the same thing)
Them hoes don't want to see me live
(They all wishing to change thing)
All doing some strange things
But leemee(?) Rico I know 
My baby mama keep them crooked police booking my dough
Looking for dough
(What you got?)
Nothing but beer, plus I got these fucking lyrics I wrote
You mean them niggaz fucking with you by flows
You make em count by zeros

Hell yeh!
I know, all up in a nigga shit
Fuckin with your women get, with it
Come on my nigga, ya'll stay committed

Oddisee,"Lost in a dream
Nothing is what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bends,
I must confess
I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again
But I wish I could trust
My body aches of mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
How could this be happening to me
I'm lying when I say, ""Trust me""
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering
Absolutely nothing we trust",Trust [Remix],2004
Oddisee,"These are good days for bad people, sad sequel to a unrated 
Story About the underrated told by the makers of the evil
And still I'm lining up to get a preview
Glory to the most wise, we came here on boat rides, wavy
Yet the ground beneath us seeming bone dry
How much for a maybe? How much for a know why
Cost an arm and leg to get ahead and you get no eyes
Shades on at night can't bring the light, I see the demons
That hang around us on evenings and party with us on weekends
Ain't numb enough, so I'mma keep the sleeping pills on tables
I count on them to counter all the fables I believe in
Cause I just want to keep on dreaming
But dreams are for suckers, attracted to your tears, sweat and bleeding
Grew a pair of fangs, called a brain left and right
I'm hungry and my bark far lesser than my bite

I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through
Has anybody stopped to ask you
Hey, how you doin'?
I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through
Has anybody stopped to ask you
Hey, how you doin'?

I'm far more concerned with the cause
Although it's the effect that is receiving the applause, or uproar
Either way it's hands up like a yep y'all
And I'm just trying to get down to the bottom of a rut wall
Giving faces to the hatred, trying to figure out the bases of humanity's disgraces
If I'm not mistaken, a Roman and a German met a Viking
On an island that was occupied by Britons
They became the British after fighting
And they merged into a Titan
That became really good at killing white men
Somebody thought it smarter to do it to people darker
Until now we harbor what was docked at the harbor

I've been thinking about you
And all the things you've been through

More in store, more corridors that I'll explore
And all in time, I'll cross their thresh and
Be better than ever before, to think
I was stressing over things that by tomorrow I forget in
Blink, in a second, switching directions
I'm on a new wave, try to focus only on progressions
All in a day's working, working, working on the lessons
Started feeling better about the answers I was getting in the mirror asking questions
I am all that I invest in- who else then?
Put me first, put me latter
I'mma find a way regardless, it's whatever
I've come so far I think I blossom when I'm battered
Say what you got to say, it don't matter
I keep climbing, I keep flying
Lauryn Hill must be somewhere, man, I see Zion
I see so much that could change on the horizon

But today I think I leave it all behind
I'm trying to catch a vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe

I got far less control over things than I think I do
On the other hand, there's a lot of things I could alter and I'm ignoring them
Situate with moves, procrastinating cause it's hard to face the problem waiting
For you to finish up having a good time
In lieu in knowing what I got to do, I got an attitude of molasses crew- slow paced
And I know what it takes, not sure how much I can give
You care enough, it'll weigh you down - that's just the way it is
You try to stay in love but it is hard as bricks
Please send me a sign, I hope that you notice
I think we spoke once before when I was at my lowest
The world is going mad but that ain't for you know it
But will it last just long enough for me to have my moment?
I just need some time for me to reach my full potential
To justify this horrid life and all that I have been through
I know I'm not the only one, the rest of y'all could vent too
But right now, just reply to what I sent you

I think I caught my vibe, I think I found my wave
You know that I boogie on boards
You know that I'm putting my foot in the tour every time I step foot on the stage
I belong in a category that only I have made, people easily impressed
Lower standards got the bottom picking while the cream of crop ain't getting harvest listen
Better for you always more expensive
Afford the privilege to the few will get it
Welcome, welcome to the party mission
Now that I got your attention, a few things I'd like to mention
Some y'all won't like all my views and that won't make no difference
I must be going crazy, my own thing is my favorite
I see who gets the praise and all but I just think they basic
Complex on occasion, few and far between
Might lose me in the middle but the start of it was mean
Tired of all this process, your packaging so clean
Ingredients so full of names that I can't even read
Addictions on the rise, it's my system, I can't lie
But now I'm on a diet- 100% vibes

Oddisee,"Just one dollar below 10K, that’s the amount I’m flying with
One more buck and the law comes out and they all want to know about why I’m rich
I’m not rich I’m just on the way back to the land where they need this grip
You give yours to a charity fund, I give mine to a cuz that’s sick
You see your name and it fourth on the list, scared I’m involved in the causing of pain
Lost somebody you loved in the towers and looking at me like I boarded the plane
I’m just an artist you’re not a target no use in arguing we all look the same
With that knowledge I stay calm when they search for bombs all they find is green
All in the name - I got a name that’ll scare all the brave in the land of the free
All in the name of protecting a country that’s shooting its citizens dead in the streets
I used to live in Northeast D.C. not too far from Capitol Hill
White House here, trap house there, they were so near you could go by feet
Never mind that cause that’s not news - let’s stay glued to the war on peace
Who gets blamed? Whoever can sway that election towards what the order seeks
We just want to keep oil cheap, we just want to keep motors full
What that mean? Distractions came, I think my TV’s clothed in wool

Man I swear they have my phoned tapped
Man I swear they watching all my moves
Since 9/11 it ain’t too clear just who the target is
I love my country, hate its politics
Can’t just let me be
Can’t just let me live
Regardless my belief
I thought the fathers wrote it clear
But darkness all I see
And darkness all I hear
I’m trying to lift the shadow but the cloud ain’t got no give
Can’t just let me be
Can’t just let me live
Regardless my belief
I thought the fathers wrote it clear
But darkness all I see
And darkness all I hear
I’m trying to lift the shadow but the cloud ain’t got no give

I was on tour when the migrants came, saw their camps on side of the road
I met a boy who arrived in the rain, he lost his folks when they torched his home
That made me want to bring my fam before they see that side of a drone
But who wants us, we build your world it’s “labor’s cool, neighbors no”
I got a cuz that’ll drive your taxi, I got a cuz that’ll make your food
I got a cuz that’ll watch your kids and pick them up when they’re done with school
I got a cuz that’ll pump your gas, I got a cuz that’s good with tools
I got a cuz that’ll be your doctor after a test that I hope he’ll pass
Isn’t that what you fear most? But fear don’t trump your needs
Our pros do trump our cons though. And cons don’t trump your greed
And monsters’ what you make of us and we make you succeed
And that’s what makes this country great, it’s built by those who bleed
It’s built by those who came on boats, it’s built by those who flee
And you forgot your family tree and we’re just all your leaves
So if you just try to chop us down you only hurt your knees
And we could go in pieces but we’d rather come in peace

Can't win em all but I just like the bet
I'm rolling the dice again
I roll to functions full of punks and wish that they feelin' me 
They clutch their fist reluctantly humbly as to build with me
Discussions over lunches on how they once can appeal to me
Tip another twenty and money don't fit the bill to me
I watch how people move, yeah they work strong
But then physically they vision weak
Smaller print of their truth just appeared to me
But that ain’t how I move, I just show and prove
Promotions fill with power man that’s power I won’t lose

I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it, try not to abuse it

What would you do if you knew you could get away with
Anything you wanted to as long as people wanted something from you?
Would you make em wait, knowing you could make all of their dreams true in a day
Go and hesitate and let em salivate until they give up and they subdue
Just to demonstrate how long it take until a person break
Power trippin' easy nowadays, nowadays all the
Culture vultures look to bottom feeders for their power plays
Bucket crowded and the crabs fighting
Puppets pick the people on their last legs
Desperate dreamers turn to dirty fiends
Hurting me to see the crowd beg in their loudest moment
Seem too clear to be clouded by those who got it golden
Brass status green could go brown at any sporadic moment
So I stay open, reply to calls, fly or fall, all in all

I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it, try not to abuse it",Strength & Weakness,2016

Or is it by their lives we are inspired

Odette,"Watch me read you
The turning pages of an epic
Dissected hallucinogenic
Black coffee addict
Life, ended lies
Cold on that metal tray
Wasting away
I watch him sneer at me
From beyond the grave
I hear him call for me

Watch me read you
I get scared when it falls dark
The creeping shadows up my arm
The sneaking scarecrows
Work their charm
But circumstantial
The way I blink when you get mad
Feel disarmed when you get sad
But turn to run when we fall back
On old behaviors

When the flavor turns from sweet to sour
That's the hour that I seek
The heavy hearts
And tired retreats
With words of hatred
Watch it seep through skin
Like sap through bark
I cower in the dark
Til your return
When will I learn?

We never wanted to be more than just a silhouette
Breathing the smoke from others mouths and lying in the dirt
So make a promise but then later we can just forget
It's hard to let your breath out when you're used to holding it

She'll go (ohh)
Got out through the window (ohh)
It's her (ohh)
Maybe it's a shadow (ohh)

You never wanted to be more than just a silhouette
But when you cry the light reflects and I see you again

“The beautiful colors of the people's faces”
“And the way they sat on top of those necks”

Watch me read you
Like words ripped right off the page
Another ghost, another day
Of melancholy, UV rays
And heavy eyelids
You just decided not to care
Compressed your fears
And cut your hair
Lifted your shirt
To find there's nothing there

Now read me
Red wine, copper stained
With curly hair and crazy eyes
Impulsive mouth
She loves the rain
But not the dark
You feel insane
The overpass is wet with blood
She turns to you to say
“Hey, We can't exist”

And in that moment, it's just bliss
It's like you've missed
A thousand years and as you kiss
It's like you drift
Between here and there
Between real and fake
As I hold my breath I can't see your face
Watch me read me,
Read you, read them, read us:
Everyone's a burning book on
Trust and lust and love and what we are and what we're made of

We never wanted to be more than just a silhouette
Breathing the smoke from others mouths and lying in the dirt
So make a promise but then later we can just forget
It's hard to let your breath out when your used to holding it

She'll go (ohh)
Got out through the window (ohh)
It's her (ohh)
Maybe it's a shadow (ohh)

You never wanted to be more than just a silhouette
But when you cry the light reflects and I see you again

So don't just see me
Oh surround me
It's getting harder, babe, to focus on just one thing
It's enigmatic
Truly astounding
The way we stand together
But we are still drifting
You are so absent
But you consume me
And when the sun goes down the night it wraps around me
You try to stand still
I can't help moving
You're like the moon that draws the tide that rushes through me

We never wanted to be more than just a silhouette
Breathing the smoke from others mouths and lying in the dirt
So make a promise but then later we can just forget

I find my body
Is not mine",Watch Me Read You,2017
Odette,"The plants grew along the road 
Like an unquenchable wildfire
I remember the times you used to think I was high
But I was too busy watching the waves of emotion 
Crash over people like the tides in the ocean
Push and pull
All you wanted was one more dance
I must confess I had no chance
To renew myself or redo myself 
You think I'm a crazy mess
Well, I agree

And you wanted to know but I had not answer for you
Trapped under the thermometer
Temperature 102
Give me life, give me love, give me lust
I'm sorry I know I ask for too much
That's because I know
It will never be enough

I remember when your hand drew circles on mine
Your skin was cold
We were battling time
I never thought I'd become something that I'm not
But everyone does, everyone does
You think I'm crazy?
I think you think I'm crazy
Well I guess I am, I am certainly not a lady
But please court me
Tell me you adore me
Tell me there's nothing wrong 
I'm a perfect human being but
You never reciprocated my desires
Even when we forced it
We always knew we'd be the liars who lied
Too often, too much, too heavy
I'm sorry I never put you first
I really hope you get me

And you wanted to know 
But I had no answer for you
Trapped under the thermometer
Temperature 102
Give me life, give me love, give me lust
I'm sorry I know I ask for too much
That's because I know
It will never be enough
It will never be enough

So I guess the moral to the story
There's no morals and no story
In your iris lies the answer
Don't focus on the black centre
Hurricanes can wash away the sins
That you perceive as, to be sins
My sins are spots and curls and skin

I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry
I never meant to alarm thee 
And I know you're not as strong as you think
You're not a diamond warrior
Your feet grow roots into the earth
And I'm a tree as well 
But I'm growing much further away from you
No one hears us
No one hears the words we scream
They're just whispers
Nightmares that scare little children in the dark
Under the bed is where it's hidden
In the dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark
Keep me awake
I'm scared to fall asleep
You used to make flowers fall slowly from the ceiling
It was magic
Some kind of superhuman I can't hold it in
Bursting with light 
But to keep me away from the heat of the fire
I left

And if you still want to know
I still have no answer for you
Trapped under the thermometer
Temperature 102
I'll give you life, I'll give you love
I'll give you lust
I'm sorry I know I ask for too much

It will never be enough

Odette Lara,"É melhor ser alegre que ser triste
Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe
É assim como a luz no coração

Mas pra fazer um samba com beleza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
Senão, não se faz um samba não

Senão é como amar uma mulher só linda
E daí?
Uma mulher tem que ter qualquer coisa além de beleza
Qualquer coisa de triste
Qualquer coisa que chora
Qualquer coisa que sente saudade
Um molejo de amor machucado
Uma beleza que vem da tristeza de se saber mulher
Feita apenas para amar
Para sofrer pelo seu amor e pra ser só perdão

Fazer samba não é contar piada
E quem faz samba assim não é de nada
O bom samba é uma forma de oração

Porque o samba é a tristeza que balança
E a tristeza tem sempre uma esperança
A tristeza tem sempre uma esperança
De um dia não ser mais triste não

Feito essa gente que anda por aí brincando com a vida
Cuidado, companheiro
A vida é pra valer
E não se engane não, tem uma só
Duas mesmo que é bom ninguém vai me dizer que tem sem provar muito bem provado
Com certidão passada em cartório do céu e assinado embaixo
Deus, e com firma reconhecida
A vida não é brincadeira, amigo
A vida é arte do encontro embora haja tanto desencontro pela vida
Há sempre uma mulher à sua espera
Com os olhos cheios de carinho
E as mãos cheias de perdão
Ponha um pouco de amor na sua vida
Como no seu samba

Ponha um pouco de amor numa cadência
E vai ver que ninguém no mundo vence
A beleza que tem um samba, não

Porque o samba nasceu lá na Bahia
E se hoje ele é branco na poesia
Se hoje ele é branco na poesia
Ele é negro demais no coração

O branco mais preto do Brasil

E ainda há tantas por viajar

On sert à l'entracte des voyages en ligne... 
File d'attente porte sept à l'embarcadère, 
on offre des droites, on squatte dans le bac chez le disquaire !

Hey oh ! Trop de merde sur les ondes on va pas faire danser le monde. 
Hey oh ! On est les pygmalions des rappeurs sans millions.
Hey oh ! Un goût amer dans nos syllabes et du spleen en décibels. 
Hey oh ! On est les pygmalions des rappeurs sans millions.

Pisse dans la soupière kick les bonnes recettes, 
l'industrie du disque pfff ! Ça reste l'industrie. 
Glisse en sous-marin, fiche un coup de machette à la grande famille des artistes bénis. 
Do ré mi facile à faire la boîte de conserve,
une saucisse et des fayots en tournée pour les concerts. 
Dans l'apéro piston, passe-moi le chorizo, 
chante le Caruso je vais te filer un bon réseau.
On empaquète, on compacte, on l'étale dans les bacs, 
on lave les cerveaux des neuneus parqués dans les boîtes.

Nique les contes de princesses, 
je loupe les rendez-vous ! Je reste sans carrosse à côté de mon grand ego. 
Coûte que coûte, je compte les heures au goutte à goutte, 
j'écoute mes doutes, mais c'est la mort au bout de l'égout. 
C'est du pareil au même : j'en ai rien à foutre ! 
Je glisse et je pisse sur le bord de ma route. 
Je rentre dans ma feuille en attendant que je la cueille. 
Dépenser mon temps à des pensées d'enfant. 
Je rappe des fois sans, quitte à dépasser l'attente,
je reste à deux pour cent dans mon conte de fées lattant. 
Avec qui je dois danser ? Je reste sur un ring. 
J'aurais dû recommencer ? Comme un fou ? Comme un dingue ? 
Pfffff !!! Se ranger, à s'en ronger les ongles, 
chez moi, se ranger revient à creuser sa tombe. 
Je rêve d'une petite qui soufflerait dans mes veines,

Cracher mes conseils sur des passant raisonnables, 
j'embrasse des comptines dans le cou un peu partout... 
Beaucoup trop flou ! Pas debout du tout ! 
Trop de tout ! Trop fou ! 
Pas du goût de tous ! Tant pis ! Y me trompent tous !

et même si des fois me scie le moral d’être ici. 
Loin de toi, sous un toit, autre fois autre chose.

j’ai rempli mes deux mains de trucs pour pas m’ennuyer. 
Loin de toi, sous le ciel, un autre ciel autre chose. 
Il fait froid, boisson chaude 2 euros 20 centimes, 
la terrasse pour fumer, chocolat et blouson, 
une écharpe, des souvenirs, ton sourire, tes colères. 
Le vroom vroom des voitures et leurs pots d’échappement rendent amer le cacao et mon marc de café. 
Aujourd’hui tout va bien je me sens si léger ! 
Je suis beau, je suis fort prêt à manger du danger. 
Loin de toi, toi t’es loin comme les îles Canaries, 
le Brésil ça n’arrive que si t’y vas et que tu veux. 
Moi je suis là loin des lianes, à mille lieues pour narguer ta saveur je crève les yeux de ton cœur amoureux. Aujourd’hui tout va bien et demain sera pareil, 
j’ai vraiment pas besoin de ta sale salsepareille, 
sale parole, parano, 2 euros 20 centimes.

Tu répondais d'un mur douillet, 
d'un bel été, d'une mort noyée.

Je t'ai passé des « songs », t'as tapé le gong, 
j'ai fait ton King Kong et rentré dans ta ronde. 
La plage, les tongs, des sacs et des bombes. 
Je désapais des thons et t’as passé l'éponge.

attendre des plombes, passer dans l'ombre...

amène ton coeur sanglant elle le mord, 
te donne son corps, t'en rends accro... 
te tire trois balles, poum poum poum dans le dos.
Et sur le trottoir y’a des cœurs qui saignent, 
des cerveaux dans le noir, des yeux qu'ont pris des beignes, 
des histoires d'amour au tournant fâché, 
où tous les discours ne sont que du temps gâché. 
Des contrefaçons d’amour en suçons, 
te laisse des sons, amère du sang.

Pleure petit bout de rien Ça fait toujours du bien 
Au milieu de que dalle De se sentir quelqu’un
J’brode mes textes Avec des plumes de paon 
Et pleure des larmes d’encre Pour les armes qui font pan
Trouves ça démago Je m’en arrange 
Fuir la tristesse, la vraie Ça me dérange
J’vois la zermi* Plus loin qu’le bout d’ma rue 
Certi d’arrêts d’bus J’ai un boul’vard d’idées en tête
J’déconnecte ! Car ici ça vend Eve 
Les cheveux peroxydés Et du Botox dans les lèvres
Ici ça pue Ici c’est gris Le monde est fada 
Ils mettent de la pression même dans les canettes de soda
Pourquoi y a tant de nerfs dans ma viande 
Dans la pub les bestiaux Sont pépères dans les landes Au cœur d’un champ de lavande
Alors j’flippe, balise Triple loops piqués 
Ouf ! Paris Hilton a compris l’sens de sa vie
Regarde nos idoles Avec leurs airs de Barbie 
Ils ont le charisme d’un chewing-gum Dopé au barbiturique
Alors j’compte ma pelouse Pour zigzaguer
Entre les rifs et les gimmicks Du saxo de mon blues
J’préfère les voyages Au dessus des nuages 
Bras d’ssus bras d’ssous Avec une petite coccinelle 
Déconnexion !

You see I'm not a player I just crush a lot
You see I'm not a gangster but I'll rush your spot
I be knowing about them broads that talk a lot
So we pull over and post up at the taco shop
Hey yo Yogi Bear be buzzing off that bacardi hard
I'm thinking to myself dog we gotta make it pop
So while these chicks be jocking us we tell them follow us
Back to the spot 'cause we bound to rock
Stopped to buy some brew and a bottle of malibu
'Cause we're gonna do what we do when we do it

We do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real Yogi
Shit, about as real as it's gotta be
'Cause we gonna do what we do homey
But is you gonna keep it real papi

You know what went down, man we shut shit down
From the cars outside you can tell we there
When the bar's sold out and ain't no Belvedere

No crowd control and the cops is scared

Catch Mac V.I.P., section of the place
With the weapon on his waist, weight, two steppin' to the base

And keep a big ass tool that's loud, that'll move the crowd
Only play the club dog if the music loud
Just boots, strictly airs, no shoes allowed, what

Bitches givin up butt when Mac perform
Everybody hands up when that track come on

Double shots of Henny rock, all night lemon drops

All night menagie trois, who came to get ride, who came to get high

Have a little of prosperity and then some

And negativity exist and you must acknowledge

It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be
And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put them in your wallet next to your money
Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey
Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees
And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC

Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin
To make your heart beat, skip, hypnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it
That means we won't stop
And I won't stop until we reach the top

It breeds while we’re asleep
It feeds when we awake
Burdens of the flesh
Our bodies are so weak
We seek the spirit’s truth
To turn the other cheek

Turning the other cheek to see a world broken, lost and vain
How can you ever look at someone else the same way?
We all bleed
The human race
Have some empathy
We are all in pain
If we commiserate
Then we can share the weight
We are all the same
We are all in

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there’s nothing left that you can take away from me
Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there’s nothing left
Nothing left that you can take away from me",Pain,2016
Of Mice & Men,"Face down, I fall to the floor
Can't say I've never been here before
So frustrating, debilitating
This emptiness there must be more

It's taking over me
I don't know what to believe
Forgetting everything
That makes me, makes me real
I find an enemy
In every word that you say
I won't let you replace
What makes me, makes me real

Start, stop, start over again
Even though you know that this will end
So frustrating, aggravating
I lost myself when I let you in

They say find your way

And you don't know anything

Of Mice & Men,"No turning back now
I'm moving ahead toward the way out
Don't you hate how
We get left behind in the fallout

Take a breath and take heart
Instead of pulling apart
When you find yourself back at the start

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
When I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way back to me
Back to me

I won't stand down
As I feel the ground begin to crack now
So I cry out
The same call to arms but with a new sound

Take a breath and take heart
When you are falling apart
And you don't even know where to start

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
When I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way back to me

Let hope be everything that you need
To march to a victory
When you can't feel the difference between
An inch and infinity

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
When I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way
I can light the way

Catches on fire underneath

I can light the way back to me

Of Mice & Men,"There are weapons in the sound
And they echo all around
And you feel the bitter sting as you fall to the ground

Memories and plans forgone
Pave the way for fear to spawn
To find a vein to feast upon
Hoping I become undone

And I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding
Unbreakable
Though I'm bending, I'll never break
I'll never break

Throwing caution to the wind
Learning how to fight again
I carry on regardless of the shape I'm in

Every torch and pitchfork thrown
Only makes the fire grow
When it engulfs you, you will know
That I will not be overthrown

And I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

I'm unbreakable
Can't defeat me, though I'm bleeding

Though I'm bending, I'll never break
