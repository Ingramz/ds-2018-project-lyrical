Bhupinder Singh,"Tum ne vo kya dekha jo kaha deevana
Hum ko nahin kuchh samajh zara samajhana

Pyaar hamein kis mod pe le aaya
Ke dil kare haye, koi to bataye, kya hoga

Battiyan bujhaa do ke neennd nahin aati hai
Battiyan bujhane se bhi neend nahin aaegi
Battiyan bujhane vaali jaane kab aaegi
Shor na machao varana bhabhi jaag jaaegi

Pyaar hamein kis mod pe le aaya
Ke dil kare haye, koi to bataye, kya hoga

Aakhir kya thi aisi bhi majaboori
Mil gaye dil ab bhi kyon hai ye doori
Are, dam hai to unase chheen ke le aayenge
Di na ghar vaalon ne agar manzoori

Pyaar hamein kis mod pe le aaya
Ke dil kare haye, koi to bataye, kya hoga",Pyar Hamen Kis Mod Pe,2008

Bi-Phonic,"Love love will keep us together
Think of me babe whenever
Some sweet talking guy comes along singing his song
Don't mess around, 
You got to be strong 
Just Stop, 'cause I really love You
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You, you belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those guys start hanging around talking me down
Hear with your heart and you won't hear a sound
Just stop, 'cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together 

Whatever young and beautiful 
Someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off 
Who'll be turning you on

I will, I will, I will, I will 
Be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
Said it before and I'll say it again while others pretend
I'll need you now and I'll need you then
Stop 'cause I really love Ya
Stop I'll be thinking of Ya
Look in my heart and let love keep us together",Love Will Keep Us Together,2002
Bia,"Eis aqui este sambinha feito numa nota só
Outras notas vão entrar, mas a base é uma só
Esta outra é consequência do que acabo de dizer
Como eu sou a consequência inevitável de você
Quanta gente existe por aí 
Que fala tanto e não diz nada
Ou quase nada

Já me utilizei de toda a escala 
E no final não sobrou nada
Não deu em nada
E voltei pra minha nota como eu volto pra você
Vou contar com a minha nota como eu gosto de você
E quem quer todas as notas 
Ré, mi, fá, sol, lá, si, dó
Fica sempre sem nenhuma
Fique numa nota só

E quem quer todas as notas 
Ré, mi, fá, sol, lá, si, dó
Fica sempre sem nenhuma
Fique numa nota só",Samba de Uma Nota So,1999
Bia,"Quem acreditou
No amor, no sorriso, na flor
Então sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz
O amor, o sorriso e a flor
Se transformam depressa demais
Quem, no coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder

E, na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou
Pois a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou",Meditação,2000
Bia,"Rio que mora no mar
Sorrio pro meu Rio 
Que tem no seu mar
Lindas flores que nascem morenas
Em jardins de sol

Rio, serras de veludo
Sorrio pro meu Rio
Que sorri de tudo
Que é dourado quase todo dia
E alegre como a luz

Rio é mar, eterno se fazer amar
O meu Rio é lua
Amiga branca e nua
É sol, é sal, é sul
São mãos se descobrindo em todo azul
Por isso é que meu Rio da mulher beleza
Acaba num instante com qualquer tristeza
Meu Rio que não dorme porque não se cansa
Meu Rio que balança

Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio
Sou Rio, sorrio",Rio,
Bia,"Écoute ma voix écoute ma prière
Écoute mon cœur qui bat laisse-toi faire
Je t'en pris ne sois pas farouche
Quand me viens l'eau à la bouche

Je te veux confiante je te sens captive
Je te veux docile je te sens craintive
Je t'en prie ne sois pas farouche
Quand me viens l'eau à la bouche

Laisse toi au gré du courant
Porter dans le lit du torrent
Et dans le mien
Si tu veux bien
Quittons la rive
Partons à la dérive
Je te prendrais doucement et sans contrainte
De quoi as-tu peur allons n'aie nulle crainte

Je t'en prie ne sois pas farouche
Quand me viens l'eau à la bouche

Cette nuit près de moi tu viendras t'étendre
Oui je serai calme je saurai t'attendre
Et pour que tu ne t'effarouches
Vois je ne prend que ta bouche",Água Na Boca [L'eau À La Bouche],2006
Bia,"Ah, meu amor natildeo vaacute embora
Vecirc a vida como chora, vecirc que triste esta canccedil atildeo
Natildeo, eu te peccedilo natildeo te ausentes
Pois a dor que agora sentes soacute se esquece no perdatildeo
Ah, minha amada me perdoa
Pois embora ainda te doa a tristeza que causei
Eu te suplico natildeo destruas tantas coisas que satildeo tuas
Por um mal que eu jaacute paguei
Ah, minha amada se soubesses
Da tristeza que haacute nas preces
Que a chorar te faccedilo eu
Se tu soubesses num momento todo arrependimento
Como tudo entristeceu
Se tu soubesses como eacute triste
Em saber que tu partiste
Sem sequer dizer adeus
Ah, meu amor tu voltarias
E de novo cairias",Appel [Apelo],2006

Bienvenidos a Miami

I can feel it in the air, ooh Miami
Miami, Miami, Miami, Miami
How you pay for all them bills (How?)
Oh the pennies (How you gonna pay 'em all?)
When I was just a little girl (I was just a little girl)
Had my sights set on a bigger world
Got myself a visa
And started catching flights to where the grass is greener

Live fast and never die
I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price
Blow up the spot like dynamite

Ain't here to be cute
I ain't here to impress (No, no, no)
You know why I'm calling, I'm here to collect (You now what I came for, I'm here to collect)
They look at me funny when I write a check
('Cause they have some thoughts with me paying in sex) (Miami, Miami)
And I was looking for a job and then I found one (I found one)
They said he want me in his video, like ground one
But why would I be Kim, I could be Kanye
In the land of opportunity and palm trees

Live fast and never die
I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price
Blow up the spot like dynamite

Now I can't afford to look back, back
I just wanna know, if you wanna run let's go

Splits fast sin the 2C

Prolly with a front, so never see me smoking Lucy
Need my money pronto, so you don't wanna see me moody
If you knew me, then you'd probably wanna get to know the new me
Vamos pa' Miami, how we live la vida loca
Me llamo Perrico pero no me gusta coca
New vice now, I need the blow with my Mimosa
Never get it twisted ain't too bougie for Corona
With the lime on the side, I bring my sense to the track
'Cause my baggage is just way too expensive to pack
I be ten toes down, two hands in the back
'Cause when you fast forward you don't ever look back

Biagio Antonacci,"Alessandra
Queste sono scale di vita
E la vita, forse non l'hai mai conosciuta
Sei già stanca
E un orologio batte le sei
E gli esami lo sai, lo sai, non finiscono mai

Alessandra non basta il tuo profumo di donna
Per cancellare il sapore dell'amore di sera 
Fatto in fretta, a fari spenti un lieve sospiro
E gli esami lo sai, lo sai, non finiscono mai

Vai Alessandra un po' impaurita
In una giacca di velluto
Nascondevi un portafortuna e
Un amore che prendeva un po' di fiato
Tra l'orgasmo e la paura
C'è un segreto nuovo
Che nessuno vuol sapere
E domani lui
Lui capirà e sarà un giorno vero
E gli esami lo sai, lo sai, non finiscono mai

Alessandra tua madre che voleva sapere
Certe cose a volte non si possono dire
No bugiarda, no, è solo un modo per evitare
E gli esami lo sai, lo sai, non finiscono mai

Vai Alessandra che sei grande
Che sei libera e completa
Giacca blu stirata
Sicura di te stessa
Un amore ogni giorno più importante
Inaspettato ma voluto
Fa dimenticare le solite paure
E la tua vita, per te resta l'esame più grande
La tua vita lo sai, lo sai, lo sai",Alessandra,1996
Biagio Antonacci,"Che ti succede adesso ridi anche tu?
E usi spesso il mio profumo perché
C'è qualcosa che
C'è qualcuno che è entrato dentro te

Adesso che non ho la donna neanch'io
Stasera andiamo fuori amico mio
Hai un impegno tu?
Che impegno hai?
Dimmi dove vai

Spero che tu sia sincero con me
Credo che tu sia sincero con me
Che ti succede vai a sciare anche tu?
E guarda caso nello stesso week-end
Ci va anche lei, è un caso si , non lo faresti mai

Hai sempre detto non è donna per te
Cos'è cambiata perché non sta più con me?
Si lo so, si lo so non sono fatti miei

Lei lo fa lei fa così per arrivare a me
Lei lo fa per farmi ingelosire
Amico mio pero', tu gli stai sempre addosso

Cucciolo appena arrivato
Assomigliami e il mondo ti dia un grande benvenuto

Su queste calde mie mani ancora sporche di gelato

E guardo ancora quegli occhi di chi si aspetta un pò di tutto

Assomigliami adesso e sarà fresca l'estate
E con l'estate vedrai i colori e che bellezze al mare
Impareremo a nuotare, impareremo a capire
Ad amare le cose, quelle piccole così

Assomiglieremo come gocce

Biagio Antonacci,"Come siamo tanti al mondo
Disorientati malguidati
Frecce sfrecciate senza mira
Che hanno fatto male

Come siamo belli al mondo
Pettinati stirati trasandati
Ancora a caccia di un mistero
Che chiamano fortuna

Ma come siamo tanti
Divisi da noi stessi
Tra l'odio e il voler bene
L'inferno e il paradiso

Come siamo tanti al mondo
E balliamo e saltiamo sulle sedie
Rincorriamo le ultime sottane
E promettiamo amore

Ma come siamo tanti al mondo
Vincitori, vinti, cuori accesi
C'è chi ha preso amore e chi l'ha dato
E chi l'ha sfiorato

Un bacio a mezzanotte
Tra il vecchio e il giorno nuovo
Lo sai ti voglio bene
Ed è la prima volta

Che mi capita di dirlo
Figli della stessa donna senza essere fratelli
Allattati con lo stesso latte con le stesse mammelle
Figli ma chissà di quali padri di quali mestieri

Concepiti per amore o per errore naturale
Ma come siamo tanti al mondo
Come siamo tanti al mondo
Come siamo tanti al mondo
Come siamo tanti al mondo
Come siamo tristi al mondo

Rincoglioniti dall'eccesso
Pubblicizzati all'occorrenza
Lo show non deve finire
Ma come siamo tanti al mondo

Stanchi e ammalati nel profondo
Rovinati dal cattivo esempio
Aiutaci buon Dio
Ma come siamo tanti al mondo

Nonostante tutto 'sto casino
Stasera esco in mezzo al mondo
E tu stammi vicino
Ma siamo soli al mondo
E cosa sono io
Che un po' mi butto via

Ma poi ci voglio credere nel sogno di domani
Figli della stessa donna senza essere fratelli
Allattati con lo stesso latte con le stesse mammelle
Figli ma chissà di quali padri di quali mestieri
Concepiti per amore o per errore naturale

Ah figli della stessa donna senza essere fratelli

Poi si innamorano e restano sole

Il sorpasso con un un colpo di magia

Senti la gioia che parte da te
E ti chiedi ogni volta
""Perchè questo mio dio l'hai regalato a me""

Che a fatica, sentiamo passare

Può tramontare, ma ci lascia

Si muove tutto, tutto

Adesso non fermarti
Una scossa dopo l'altra
Fino all'ultimo respiro
Fa crollare proprio tutto

E mi accorgo finalmente che
Il terremoto sei solo tu che
Mi massacri il cuore
Si, il terremoto
Sei davvero tu

Mi rallenti il cuore
Si il terremoto sei davvero tu
Che mi distruggi il cuore
Si il terremoto ancora tu
Non calpestarmi il cuore",Terremoto,1999

Io rubo, frugo e annego

Questo caos di città
E poi faccio I complimenti a chi ha coraggio
E se ne va
A chi si sveglia presto anche se va a letto tardi
Disprezzo invece chi accetta tutto e dice sì
Ma tra le righe di qualche libro che
Potrebbe essere anche in casa mia

C'è scritto chi verrà
Spero che sia scritto in piccolo così

È un frullato di pensieri
Di dubbi e di incertezze

Abbiamo tutto da imparare e ben poco da insegnare
Ma abbiamo un jolly nelle mani e voglia di restare
Tra le righe dove c'è la verità

Anche senza commentare...BACIANO LE DONNE
Certe sere anche le stelle...BACIANO LE DONNE
Certe sere anche le donne...BACIANO LE DONNE

Quando il tuo amore beve
Tutto il resto intorno è lieve
Tutto il resto intorno è assente
Tutto il resto resta ambiente
Però se molti anni indietro non giudicava Gesù
Dimmi perché adesso vuoi giudicarmi tu?

Che quello che hai dentro è potente,
È un bene che non tocca a tutti.

D'averne persino paura,
Da farne l'esempio di tutto e da tutti,
Tenerlo segreto e staccato,
Da farlo morire poi dopo.
E tu sei bella
Come Venezia addosso.
Venere dolce che rendi fecondo
Le sponde di un cuore che aveva fallito.
Tu sei bella
Tanto da farne un vanto,
Non c'è fragranza per farti un esempio,
Non c'è neanche un fatto che porta un ricordo.

Al mare ci andiamo più tardi,
Se il sole si abbassa è più bello,
Un nostro tramonto è più rosso del sangue
che abbiamo appena mischiato
È forte il profumo del nudo.

Tu sei bella,
Bella che riempi un campo,
Sera che arrivi non puoi portar via
la luce del quadro migliore che ho fatto.

Che quello che io sento di te è forte 
Quello che io sento di te è sempre che tu 
Mi piaci, tu mi dici 
Non sono in grado di amarti 

Lì che tempo fa 
Tu sarai già al mare 
Prenditi il tuo tempo e non sentirti in colpa mai

Il grano da crescere I campi da arare
Guardare ogni giorno
Se piove o c'e' il sole
Per saper se domani
Si vive o si muore
E un bel giorno dire basta e andare via

Andare via lontano
A cercare un altro mondo
Dire addio al cortile
Andarsene sognando

E poi mille strade grigie come il fumo
In un mondo di luci sentirsi nessuno
Saltare cent'anni in un giorno solo
Dai carri dei campi
Agli aerei nel cielo
E non capirci niente e aver voglia di tornare da te

('Cause they have some thoughts with me paying in sex) (Miami, Miami)

Sprinkle morning all over you and I

Maybe you were happy for a while

Lola you're a star tonight
Don't let them
Pluck you from the sky
Lonely Lola everybody knows

Everybody calls themselves your friend
But later on tonight when it gets cold
Lola who's a gonna love you then
But there's something in your eyes tonight

Forget them
And take it in your stride
My friends told me 'bout 
How you've been getting out

But no one seems to know your name
Slide on through the crowd 
And let them talk aloud
They only want to hold ya

And so you I'm a Lonely Lola sure
Everybody gets that way sometimes
And only Lola you could know the cure
Wait it out and Lola you'll be fine

Its easy if you try tonight
Don't sit there
And keep on asking why
My friends told me 'bout 

How you've been getting out
And no one seems to know your name
Slide on through the crowd
And let them talk aloud

They only want to hold ya
Do they really know ya lola
Lonely you're on fire tonight
Don't sit there

And keep on asking why
My friends told me bout 
How you've been getting out
And no one seems to know your name

Slide on through the crowd

I heard you were in the neighbourhood
I've been a long time on the skids
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river

When it long ran over you
This is for you standing up to a bone-chilling wind
This is for the failures you collected from my sin
And this is for your lonesome tears I never dried

This is for you hanging in in the hope that it never dies
And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river
When it long ran over you
This is for you waiting up though the call never came

And this is for your lonesome tears I never dried

And baby I'm beside you - you run from the river

When it long ran over you
And now I'm running here beside you
And now I'm running here beside you

How can someone wicked walk around free

Bic Runga,"Gracie takes the bottles from the porch where you had left them
There are age-old drinks of wine you never shared.
Drivin' down the motorway, with all the best intentions,
She a picture of perfection with her cut and coloured hair.

But it's you she thinks of in the hours while she's awake
She takes her lipstick from her case to make a smile
You she thinks of when she thinks of her mistakes
Regrets an open road that streches out for miles.

Coffee pots, and bottle tops
And all of this disorder
She soaks the plates in the dishwater till it's cold
Her reflection in the window of the stars around the corner
Walk beside her as she's stridin' down the road

But it's you she thinks of in the hours while she's awake
She takes her lipstick from her case to make a smile
You she thinks of when she thinks of her mistakes
Regrets an open road that streches out for mi-I-I-I-iles

Bic Runga,"The gift that keeps on giving
Is coming to my house
Like a wild deer at my doorway
He was suddenly so close
The beams are made of cedar wood
The rafters made of fir
The garden hols a fountain
Honeycomb and myrrh

I walked along the broadways
Looking for my love
I asked among the watchmen
Have you seem my love?
Promise not to wake him sisters
Let him sleep his time
He comforts me with apples
Sucourrs me with wine

holy night blessed daylight
You are my true delight

Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
But your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
And your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go

The last that I saw
With eyes filled with rain
A waterfall of gold
It flickered on his face

And waited at the bridge
I waved him goodbye
He vanished o'er the ridge
(vanished o'er the ridge)

My face to the heavens
I waited for a sign
But only cloudy demons were circling in the sky
(circling in the sky)

I cried to the rain

To bring my love again

Fleeting as the wind that passes on the plains
Never to be ball and chain
Never to be seen again
Somewhere in the night how sweet you sing for me

Oh in the still of the cool day

Deep inside a dream I swore I was awake
Waking to the tune I hear your voice again
Lifted by a sudden breeze
Tangled in the cypress trees

Safe from a slinging arrow
Think of the love we knew
How it goes on

Five days of love
There is a scent in the air
Above & beyond
The one who named us

Climb once again
Cast off your sorrows
The long night will end
Won't get the best of you

Fire it straight and true to wherever you are

Não me faça tirar meus pés do chão

Não quer conhecer a sua cama, ela quer conhecer teus pais

Fecho os olhos e confio mas com uma condição

Bienvenido Rodriguez,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando

Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Evening to you Lord and watch us over tonight
Don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord,1999
Biff Watson,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999
Biff Watson,"The General just gave me a medal oh I'm a sight for mom to see
But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And men who've died for men on earth will get their heavenly dues
And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill
When I hang this medal around the neck of Oklahoma Bill",Oklahoma Bill,1999
Biff Watson,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down
",Sunday Morning Coming Down,1999
Biff Watson,"Well it was battered and scared,
And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?
Raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end,
Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna to bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch of the Master's hand.

You know threes many a man with his life out of tune,
Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch, that's all it was; it was the touch of the Master's hand,
It was the touch of the Master's hand; oh, it was the touch of the Master's hand.

Et t'as beau faire semblant de t'en sortir
On va tous se voir mourir
Ailleurs y a toujours pire ouais, ailleurs y a toujours pire
J'vois pas plus loin qu'mon bourrelet
Ma cons' est toujours lège, la phrase est toujours bête
Sans cesse bloqué dans ma tête

Au Mésopot' j'mange un kébab avec deux ou trois fromages
J'profite du temps qu'on me donne
Je m'adonne à la souye puis je m'abonne à mes couilles
Elles postent deux selfies par jour
C'est suffisant pour ma part
Ça suffit j'fais plus de blague

Sur l'canap' j'en mène pas large
J'regarde la 4 y a que d'la merde

Relax all your muscles, son, just hope your heart's in one piece

Well I was way to lost in a sinner's haze
Burning up the days

When he said son you don't want to wake up dead
And find yourself alone in the fires of hell

With the smell of napalm in the air

Now he's fifty-eight and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the Shrapnel they left in his leg
He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

Big & Rich,"I was raised by the good book
Learned to work hard every day
Thought that if you can't say something good
There's nothing good to say
And I caught on pretty early it's no use to work
No harder than you play
So I guess that's how I ended up this way

[Chorus:]
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace
Is a place I keep finding myself
Yeah I get a little crazy trying to have a little fun
Then I end up back where I started from
Down on my knees, I pray
Oh Lord let me see another day
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace

Well I give everything I got, try to give more than I take
For Heaven's sake I keep on smiling
No matter what comes my way
And I may be passin' out on Friday night
But come Sunday I'll be passing the collection plate

With the smell of napalm in the air

As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky

Now he's fifty-eight and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the Shrapnel they left in his leg
He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

I was lost

Big 6,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Big 6,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1998

Shake their shoulders bold.

Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

Big Al Carson,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The moon stood still

Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

Though we're apart

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

On a tout donné pour le sommet l'amour et un peu d'or
Les murs sont tombés on en revient deux fois plus fort
Oh oh oh oh oh oh cœur de guerrier
Oh oh oh oh oh oh cœur de guerrier

Je viens de loin trace mon chemin
Je passe pour un gue-din
Je parle de mes prières celles d'hier, celles de demain
Le cœur dans une impasse, les sœurs me trouvent sympa
Elles savent que j'ai dû passer de la cave à l'Olympia
Fuire mon empire, devenir un gaillard
Monter sur scène, succès, mettre le faya
Ici les petits frères me considèrent comme une icône
Appelle-moi Kool Shen, ""I make music for my people""
Mes rêves m'ont étourdi, mes frères m'avaient tout dit
Je suis malade, à mon tour besoin d'amour
Pas d'un toubib
J'ai dû aller au casse-pipe
J'ai dû lâcher des classiques
Parmi les ordis, je ne suis pas sorti d'un casting
Bomayé Music dans ma disco
Je suis la réincarnation de Biggie Small
Et je milite pour la même gimmick
Vétéran et différent, Sky is the limit

Now some could confuse confidence for cocky,
Attitude Stallone or better yet rocky,
Fall down, get back up, fall down again get back up,
Fall down again get back up, again
I lost my home in a hurricane but that's nothing to a veteran.
Moms cry, told her don't worry I got her,
Closed escro on a crib in the Bahamas uh
Seeing D make me go to plan B, but that's right so we take care of family
Not even, mother nature could stop my paper
Done been through whatever what's a little bad weather huh?
Faith in god is what keeps me hard
And death before dishonour when it comes to the squad.
All I got in this world is my word and my balls
So when I grab the mike I grab my crotch and stand tall, like a veteran

On a tout donné pour le sommet l'amour et un peu d'or
Les murs sont tombés on en revient deux fois plus fort
Oh oh oh oh oh oh cœur de guerrier
Oh oh oh oh oh oh cœur de guerrier

10 ans déjà, comme le temps passe
Ce ne fût pas parfait mais tout est vrai
Il y a eu du chemin depuis ""Avec Classe""
Échecs et succès, que des histoires vraies
S'il faut du talent pour monter il faut beaucoup de cœur pour rester
Je suis pas dans les affaires, des sommets éphémères
Et je prendrais mon temps pour le prouver
Seul dans le ring avec mon égo
J'ai pas d'autres ennemis
Oh
Seul dans le ring avec des échos
Le passé qui m'a tout pris
Oh
Petit à petit j'ai reconstruit
Petit à petit, refait mon nid
J'ai appris que l'amour n'a pas de prix
Chaque jour, comme le dernier, je me le dis

Parce que je suis rentré dedans sans prétention
Aucune mauvaise intention
Juste une envie d'en sortir avec mention
D'une vie âpre, j'ai appris de belles leçons
A pris mainte et mainte défaites, lésions
Ce qui ne m'a pas tué m'a rendu plus fort
Petit frère n'écoute pas ceux qui colportent
Sache que, qu'importe les portes qui se ferment
Les diables te supportent comme le dernier des Mohicans

Big Audio,"I saw Elvis washing clothes
In the launderette by the growth
Watchin' powder on his nose
Down the Harrow Road
He was talkin' 'bout a song
Had it all, but got it wrong
Now he wants to join the band
And play along

So many stories being told
Down Harrow Road
Since you're reality a row

There's this bloke who thinks he's handy
Selling gloves and homemade brandy
He comes all the way from Wendy

From the bridge of back to forth
Don't let them work in overnight

There's a new dance that's going around
When the hits start flying you gotta get down

When you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

A dance to the tune off economic decline
Is when you do the bottom line
Nagging questions always remain
Why did it happen and who was to blame?

When you reach the bottom line
The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

They've been doing it down at the zoo
And I can show ya here's what to do

The only thing to do is climb
Pick yourself up off the floor
Don't know what you're waiting for

Give us this day our daily bread and send us on our way
Perchance to dream or take a holiday

Cue talk breakdown on point forty four
There must be a place, the preacher says, ""I guess""
But a drifter will tell you, no place is best

Didn't think that you could get
So much from a picture show
Man dies first reel
People ask what's the deal?
This ain't how it's supposed to be
Don't like no aborigine

Took a trip in Powis Square
Pop star dyed his hair
No fans to scream and shout
When mobsters came to flush him out
Gangland slaying underground
New identity must be found
On the left bank for a while
Insanity Bohemian style

Only buildings no people prophecy
Time slide place to hide nudge reality
Foresight minds wide magic imagery, oh oh

Met a dwarf that was no good
Dressed like little Red Riding Hood
Bad habit taking life
A calling card a six inch knife
Ran off really fast
Mumbled something 'bout the past
Best sex I've ever seen
As if each moment was the last
Drops of blood color slide
Funeral for his bride
But it's him who's really dead
Gets to take the funeral ride

Placed upon the screen instead
She's my flame too hot to hold
Had to settle for her cold

Gone bust, tight wad, slow recovery
Axe job, flame thrower, iron bar and gun
Betting shop, New owner, A walk in the sun

Sometimes notions get reversed

The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots
Ha yeah!
Suited up ready to dumbs out
Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

And most of those shows were with David Allen Coe

Big Band Bellaterrra,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1998

넌 늘 내가 다른 맘 안 먹게

뜬 구름과도 같이 새파랗게
