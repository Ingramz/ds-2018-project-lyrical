"Paul Jackson, Jr.","I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you 
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say ""I love you""
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
 
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop 
Oh my love, a million days in your arms 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
Never too much, never too much
Never too much, never too much
 
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning
 
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop 
Oh my love, a million days in your arms 
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you is never
A thousand kisses from you
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
",Never Too Much,2004
"Paul Jackson, Jr.","All at once 
I finally took a moment 
And I'm realizing that 
You're not coming back 
And it's finally hit me all at once 
All at once I've started counting teardrops 
And at least a million fell 
My eyes began to swell 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I looked around and found that you were 
With another love 
In someone else's arms 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once 
All at once the smile that used to greet me 
Brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away 
And left me with just memories all at once 

Ever since I met you 
You're the only love I've known 
And I can't forget you 
Though I must face it all alone 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And that's all that matters now 
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Holding on to memories 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows 
All at once 

All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea 
Wishing you'd come back to me 
And it's hurt me more than you know 
So much more than it shows

So much more",All at Once,2009
"Paul Jackson, Jr.","I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all
 
I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all
 
And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",Greatest Love of All,2009

"Paul Jackson, Jr.","A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes, I'm saving all my love

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me
Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so, so did I
Now when I remember spring
And every little lovely thing
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Paul Jacobsen,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?
What did I do to be so black and blue?",Black and Blue,2003
Paul Jacobsen,"Beware or someday you might regret you ever cared 
For someone who know me I'm at the end of running scared, 
Planning parachutes, escape routes in midair. 
Hoping that you catch yourself back at square one, 
These days we'll both be fine.
Every, everybody says it just takes time 
And all the clocks are crawling now, 
It feels like days since the sun cracked out.

I'm sorry that it didn't work, you must think I'm just a jerk, 
For singing this today, but I never meant to make you feel this way.

My cousin Anne, said I'm a real sorry excuse for a man. 
And I take it personally except I am, still wondering how she hurt.
Fly on the wall a little bird 
Walls that talk telephone and scream how everyone knows everything.

I'm sorry that it had to hurt you must think that I'm the worst, 
For singing this today but I never meant to make you feel this way

There were days, when the first thought that came with the rising sun, 
Were how many hours until the day was done, 
And I hoped that I would only cry just once.

So hearts, should come with disclaimers warnings from the start, 
Before I could fall or we could grow apart, 
And me still thinks I'm wrong though I know I feel much better moving on 
Still the time keeps slowing down and sometimes can I still come around

I'm sorry that it didn't work, you must think that I'm a jerk",Sorry,2003
Paul James,"Please, forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has its funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?",Fine and Dandy,1997
Paul James,"Well, I took me a woman late last night,
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""
I hot-footed it, bare-naked
Out the window!

Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
(Right there
Proud as can be)

I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Cost a quarter
And I had to get out quick
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna

Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Anita Ekberg, 
Sophia Loren.""
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!

Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.
Licks my face and tickles my ear,
Bends me over and buys me beer.
(She's a honeymooner
A June crooner
A spoon feeder
And a natural leader)

Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,
I got a woman who works on the levee.
Pumping that water up to her neck,
Every week she sends me a monthly check.
She's a humdinger
Folk singer
Dead ringer
For a thing-a-muh jigger

Late one day in the middle of the week,
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.
I chased me a woman up the hill,
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.
It was Little Bo Peep!
(I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a bean stalk
I jumped a Ferris wheel)

Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.
(He's eatin' bagels
He's eatin' pizza
He's eatin' chitlins
He's eatin' bullshit!)

Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.
(It's that greasy kid stuff.
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,
Charles de Gaulle
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)

Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.
(She's a little bit heavy!)

Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,
It levels my head and eases my mind.
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I see better days and I do better things.
I catch dinosaurs
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)",I Shall Be Free,2003
Paul Janz,"You roll me in
And wrap me up
You rock my heart in the cradle of love
I feel tender pull

Magnetism
We could survive a mild collision
You're my only soul contender
I can't fight it

I surrender
Can't you tell that I'm

[Chorus]
Stuck on you
I'm stuck on you
I'll hold you like a rock
I'll stick like glue

There'll never be a woman
Who moves like you
Baby I'll cover
There'll never be another
And I'll never make you cry

I can't stand the hurt
Flowing in your eyes
I'll never let you down
Or say goodbye

No, No, No
I'm stuck on you
Can I get closer
You're the girl I can't get over

When you look at me
I'm a diamond changing
I want to get lost in your cool invasion
I'm not lookin'

For luck or money
Just pour like sugar
Stick like honey
Girl can't you tell that I'm

Your roll me in
And you wrap me up
You rock my heart
In the cradle

Paul Janz,"Every little word you say
Every little breath you steal
Every one just drives me crazy
Baby, it's the way I feel
I'll do anything you ask me
Everything I'll do for you
'Cause darlin' you're my main attraction
You give me such tenderness
I think I love you
Spend my nights just dreamin' of you
Don't you want me
Say you need me baby
Take my hand
1st chorus
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I'll be there for you baby
I can't stop wanting you
Every little hurt you're hiding
Every single one you hold
Every little tear you're crying
Resting in your eyes like gold
Everything's a stimulation
Every little thing you touch
Ooh, you're so intoxicating
You give me such tenderness
I think I love you
Spend my nights just dreamin' of you
Don't you want me
Say you need me baby
Take my hand
2nd chorus
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I'll be there for you baby
I can't stop wanting you
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I love you too much baby
And I'd rather be there with you
Think about it
You could have everything
Think about it
Can't you see what love can bring
Think about it
Turn around don't walk away
Think about it
I can't stop wanting you

Paul Jason Smith,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1992
Paul Jeffrey,"Ben, the two of us need look no more,
We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own,
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see,
You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
Ben most people would turn you away;
I don't listen to a word they say.
They don't see you as I do;
I wish they would try to'
I'm sure they'd think again if they had a friend like Ben,

That shines upon our caravan

Across the sand so I may keep

As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Paul John Weller,"You're savages, he knows you are
Do you not think that god is looking down?
On you savages.. the children run, to mothers
You put bullets in their backs
Ah cowards, can you not see
Do you not think that love is coming down?

You have no gods, they have all disowned you
You have no love, so you take it out on
People's lives in progress
That's what keeps you going when you're savages

Savages, you can dress it up
Give it a name and a fancy uniform
And a flag to fly to hide behind
Can you not see the truth that's on the ground

You have no love
It has all gone cold on you
You never have, so you take it out on
Those whose love is growing

When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl ooh)

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame 
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim

And you are lying in bed
With the covers pulled up tight
And though you count every sheep
You get the feeling that sleep
Is gonna stay away tonight

That's when you hear it coming
That is when you hear the humming
Of the midnight train
Here again
Can't explain that midnight train
That midnight train

Are you real? Yes or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go

Come try to take me away
But bring me back before day
Light and fill the time between
Take me to everywhere
But don't abandon me there
Just want to say I've been

I believe in you completely
Though I may be dreaming sweetly
Of the

Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go

But more, much more than this
I did it my way

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

She looked as though she'd been a'cryin' half of the night

Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same

And who would underestimate the actress now?

But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory

They actually called me a whore!

Paul Joseph,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2001

On Valentine's Day

When you're so far away

Don't make me a victim
Don't make me the clown
With my arms reaching out
And my head hanging down

We can't go on
Touching the flame
Breakin the rules
Of the game

I bring you this cross
I carved out of wood
I'm just trying to tell you
That I'd change if I could

Grew up on the west side
Never even been to the east side
Don't know what they do with their lives
Over there over there

Paul Joseph Moore,"In this dusty little railroad town
Smack in the heart of the bible belt
Where nothing ever changes
While nothing remains the same
When first I saw the raven
Lean against the wind
I said who's the girl
With the tattoo on her skin
I followed her home
She lives down by the water
My friend Teddy told me
She's the Frenchman's daughter

On this day of reckoning
I'm riding shotgun with you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

When I come knocking on her front door
The neighbour said she don't live there no more
Well she moved from the country
Down to the city
Where the scene was dark
And the street was gritty
In the hustle and bustle and all the commotion
She got addicted to the locomotion

On this day of reckoning
By the old wooden bridge
I wait for you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

I remember the smell of the burning leaves
And we were making love
She was like a young Georgia O'Keefe
From another time
In an old abandoned railroad shack
On should never go
Where anything can happen
When the zephyr blows

On this day of reckoning
I'm calling to you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

The phone rings she said
I can't tell you where I'm calling from
Cause my papa's on the lam
For something shady that he's done
There hangs a tale of love
For the first time
For the first time

Paul Joseph Moore,"The sun was going down
Over Echo Park
Wet raven hair
Glowing in the dark
And that's when the fever would rise
And lord what a look in her eyes
From the moment that she blows out the light
We'd be lost in the forever night

Hold back the dawn
Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn

I dreamt if I could lay you upon this bed of straw
And we may break the rules but we don't break the law
Come across but the river's too wide
I'd come across but the river's too high
And over by the fountain where we meet
I will lay silver roses at your feet

Hold back the dawn
Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn

Now I have seen a painting
Old and hanging in a frame
And that painting was of you
Now how can you explain
From another place in time
Done many years ago
Why I'm haunted by this vision
Guess we'll never know
And then she turned and whispered in my ear
Can you feel my heartbeat

Hold back the dawn
Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn
(Let the night go on, let the night go on, let the night go on)

Won't you raise
Won't you raise up
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn

I saw the ghosts of yesterday
And my godmother bless her soul

Remember when I was just a kid
And she would tell a story

Of the rainbow
Rainbow

I come to you with an empty heart
It's locked and I've lost the key
Now she was old and almost blind
But she sees more than you or me
With her cane pointed towards the sky
She said I'll know if you've heard
The silence between the words

Of the rainbow
Rainbow
No one knows
Where the rainbow goes

Walk down the long road
Your back against the wind
And should you lose yourself again
I've been down the old road
But that was long ago
I want you to walk with me
When the rains come again
And shine this light over you

Rainbow
That's the sign of the rainbow
Rainbow

Walk on down the hard road
That's buried in your soul
And you can feel the light within
Go upon a mountain
That's painted in the sky
I want you to ride with me
When the rains come again
And I will carry you home

Walkin to the rainbow
The halo of the sun
And you will dance the song of light
I could see forever
High upon the hill
I want you to walk with me
When the rains come again
And shine this light over you

And your cheeks so soft,

Tearing my fear apart

It touches my foolish heart.

Paul Kandel,"So here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
What makes a monster and what makes a man

Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells

Whatever their pitch, you
Can feel them bewitch you
The rich and the ritual knells
Of the bells of Notre Dame",The Bells of Notre Dame (Reprise),1999
Paul Kandel,"Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame

Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

The bells of Notre Dame

(Kyrie Eleison)
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin
(Kyrie Eleison)
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within

Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibylla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando Judex est venturus

See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame

(Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control
(Kyrie Eleison)
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see

Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man

Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame",The Bells of Notre Dame,1999
Paul Kandel,"Come one, come all
Leave your loops and milking stools
Coop the hens and pen the mules
Come one, come all
Close the churches and the schools
It's the day for breaking rules
Come and join the feast of
Fools!

Once a year we throw a party here in town
Once a year we turn all Paris upside down
Every man's a king and every king's a clown
Once again it's topsy turvy day
It's the day the devil in us gets released
It's the day we mock the prig and shock the priest
Everything is topsy turvy at the feast of fools

Topsy turvy
Everything is upsy daysy
Topsy turvy
Everyone is acting crazy
Dross is gold and and weeds are a bouquet
That's the way on topsy turvy day

Topsy turvy
Beat the drums and blow the trumpets
Topsy turvy
Join the bums and thieves and strumpets
Streaming in from Chartres to Calais
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy
On the sixth of January
All because it's topsy turvy day

Come one, come all
Hurry, hurry here's your chance
See the mystery and romance
Come one, come all
See the finest girl in France
Make an entrance to entrance
Dance, la Esmeralda
Dance!

Here it is, the moment you've been waiting for
Here it is, you know exactly what's in store
Now's the time we laugh until our sides get sore
Now's the time we crown the King of Fools
You all remember last year's king?
So make a face that's horrible and frightening
Make a face as gruesome as a gargoyle's wing
For the face that's ugliest will be the King of Fools
Why?

Topsy turvy!
Ugly folks, forget your shyness
Topsy turvy!
You could soon be called Your Highness
Put your foulest features on display
Be the king of topsy turvy day

Everybody!
Once a year we throw a party here in town
Hail to the king
Once a year we turn all Paris upside down
Oh, what a king!
Once a year the ugliest will wear a crown
Girls, give a kiss!
Once a year on topsy turvy day
We've never had a king like this

And it's the day we do the things that we deplore
On the other three hundred and sixty-four
Once a year we love to drop in
Where the beer is never stoppin'
For the chance to pop some popinjay
And pick a king who'll put the top
In Topsy Turvy
Topsy turvy
Mad and crazy, upsy daysy, Topsy Turvy Day!",Topsy Turvy,1999
Paul Kantner,"There's an island way out in the sea
Where the babies they all grow on trees
And its jolly good fun
To swing in the sun
But you gotta watch out if you sneeze-sneeze
You gotta watch out if you sneeze

Yeah you gotta watch out if you sneeze
For swingin' up there in the breeze
You`re liable to cough
You might very well fall off
And tumble down flop on your knees-knees
Tumble down flop on your knees

And when the stormy winds wail
And the breezes blow high in a gale
There's a curious dropping and flopping and plopping
And fat little babies just hail-hail
Fat little babies just hail

And the babies lie there in a pile
And the adults they come after awhile
And they always pass by
All the babies that cry
And take only babies that smile-smile
They take only babies that smile...
Even triplets and twins if they'll smile",The Baby Tree,1970

Paul Kantner,"Hide witch hide the good folks come to burn thee
Their keen enjoyment hid behind a gothic mask of duty

Put your old ladies back into bed
Put your old men into their graves
Cover their ears so they can't hear us sing
Cover their eyes so they can't see us play
Get out of the way
Let the people play
We're gonna get down on you
Come alive all over you
Dancin' down into your town

You know tyrannosaurus rex was destroyed before
By a furry little ball that crawled along
The primeval jungle floor
He stole the eggs of the dinosaur
Close your eyes & create the sound
Open your hands & rebuild the ground
We are egg snatchers -
Flashin' sunshine children
Bunch of diamond thieves

You unleash the dogs
Of a grade-b movie star governor's war
While you sit in the dark -
Insane with the fear of dying
We'll ball in your parks
Insane with the flash of living

I'm alive
I am human
I will be alive again
So drop your fuckin' bombs
Burn your demon babies
I will be again
Rabid lover-feelin' the starch in your grin
Callin' for acid cocaine and grass
And receiving your homemade gin
Push the button
Pull the switch
Cut the beam
C'mon make it march
Sign me up as a diplomat, my only office is the park

You need to be out before you come in
After you come you go
In the midst of yang is a smaller part of yin
And when it happens you know 
The dawn comes

Hey dick
Whatever you think of us is totally irrelevant
Both to us now and to you
We are the present
We are the future
You are the past
Pay your dues and get outta the way
'Cause we're not the way you used to be
When you were very young
We're something new
We don't quite know what it is
Or particularly care
We just do it - you gotta do it
Let the music do it, take you there
Do it, do it, do it gotta do it
Something new, something new, something new
New, new

Open your eyes there's a new world a-comin'
Open your eyes there's a new world today
Open your hearts people are lovin'
Open it all we've come to stay
I said, open it all we've come to stay
I said, open it all we've come to stay
People, hey you people, everybody
Us young people come to stay

We've all come to stay

Amerika hates her crazies
And you gotta let go you know
Gotta let go you know
Gotta let go you know
Gotta let go you know or else you stay

Gravity gone from the cage
A million pounds gone from your heavy mass
All the years gone from your age

Glistening with lakes in the jupiter starlite
Room for babies and byzantine dancing astronauts of renown
The magician and the pantechnicon
Take along the farmer and the physician
We gotta get out and down
Back into the future
Beyond our own time again
Reachin' for tomorrow

The melting acid fever streakin' through my mind

And oh so easy to touch you

Dear brumus, the ship'll be ours and you got to roll with it
Though your master's head's blown off you got to go with it

Free - the only way to fall
The light in the night is the sun
And it can carry you around the planetary ground
And the planetary whip of the sun
Will carry you well past gideon
And the people you see will leave you be
More than the ones you've known before
Hey - rollin' on
We come and go like a comet
We are wanderers
Are you anymore? 
The land is green and you make it grow

Paul Kantner,"She'll suck on anything you give her
Stare at anything that's shiny bright
Her voice cuts through the sea even when its stormy
But she's only two feet high - she'll get higher

I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
It all comes in so fast it all comes in

She sleeps through almost any sound
Even when its screaming loud and clear
But she wakes up and smiles at a friendly voice
If it whispers softly in her ear

I see in her new face, a clear beginning
It all comes in so fast it all comes in
She knows who she is without looking
She says it out happy when the feeling is there
She's an all new person who says just what she feels
She's a fat faced goddess of nowhere

I hope she sees some things that will make her time happy
It all comes in so fast it all comes in

Answer be perfectly
Free?

You will - shove it
In your mouth any way

Blood like wine - save

You're talking about?
Then slice me tender
Raw and lean
Where are the bodies
For dinner?

Wait - bodies slumped
Face in plate
Wake up the drunks
The coffers on
The fourteenth course
Has come and gone.

Come and gone
And its left you
With your mouth
Wide open.

Paul Kantner,"What would it gain me
If I was to go?
Like Jacob of old
To the well of the world

To wax halls where candles
Burn on through the day
To light you a path
So you'd never lose your way

I was down in the valley
Where the shadows are long
The birds in the harp tree
Were singing this song

There is time to deliver
Time to receive
All that you're lacking
Of whatever you need

Turn around, by the by
You'll still see the sea
As it was in the dawning
As it always will be

Raise up your bottles
And drink down the blood
You planted the vine here
In spite of the flood

Turn an ear to the harp tree
An eye to the wall
The songs in the singing
Or nowhere at all

No where to come from
No place to retire
No shelter nowhere
Except in the fire

The birds in the harp tree
Can finish their song
Then rest in its branches
Which is where they belong

But where can a man go
That's sweet to his soul
When his time is not ready
But he's still turning old

Here's a dream for the piper
And a tune for his lady
Outside the thin wall
The waves are still raging

Here's one for the harp tree
And one for his song
One for the morning
When the night was too long

Here's one for the candle
That lights you to bed
And one for the sword
That hangs over your head

Give it to the man who'll have them back

Soon I come into the hum of Forbidden Street

I love the trash on Forbidden Street
I love the trash, it smells so sweet
You've seen the best, now see the rest
Here below in the land of stealth
Far away from a land called health
Intrigue is all I breathe
Thy will be done, thy kingdom come, on Forbidden Street

I see the bright sky
I hear the music
I watch you sleeping
I love your bruises

Have you heard, they're moving in?
Those who weigh and measure sin
They study crimes, they give them names
The lights are on in Forbidden Street
Everybody's gone
There's no one there left to meet
The rusted horns, the broken drums, on Forbidden Street

Late on a Friday my husband went up to the mountains with three friends
They took provisions and bottles of bourbon to last them all through the weekend
One hundred miles they drove just to fish in a stream
And there's so much water so close to home
When they arrived it was cold and dark; they set up their camp quickly
Warmed up with whisky they walked to the river where the water flowed past
Darkly
In the moonlight they saw the body of a young girl floating face down
And there's so much water so close to home
When he hold me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white
It was too hard to tell how long she'd been dead, the river was that close
To freezing
But one thing for sure, the girl hadn't died very well to judge from the
Bruising
They stood there above her all thinking the same thoughts at the same time
There's so much water so close to home
They carried her downstream from their fishing; between two rocks they
Gently wedged her
After all they'd come so far, it was late
And the girl would keep; she was going nowhere
They stayed up there fishing for two days
They reported it on Sunday when they came back down
There's so much water so close to home
When he holds me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white
The newspapers said that the girl had been strangled to death and also molested
On the day of the funeral the radio reported that a young man had been arrested
I went to the service a stranger; I drove past the lake out of town
There's so much water so close to home
When he holds me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white

Cigarette smoke in my hair,
Unglued my eyes and saw a dirty room,
Spilling ashtray by my bed
Empty bottle on the chair

No one else was there

I was ready in two minutes flat
Just washed my face and combed my hair
I had an eight-twenty-five train to catch
I was out there,
Flying thought the front door
Then I hit the air!

No you! No you! No you! No you!
No you, no you, no you!

Like an ant into a hole
I stood in the crowded carriage

Many lives I could have lived, many trails taken
It always seems that way at twenty-three
You walk into a room sometime and then a window opens
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
A morning train I had to catch, I just lay there sleeping
There was nothing in that town to hold me
By the time the clock had done another day of creeping
My life had changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm sorry that today I have to go away
Seven children I have raised, I love some more than others
The hardest thing to do is to set them free
So I learned my lesson hard seven times all over
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
I never was the kind of girl for acting sentimental
I never called our meeting destiny
I just call it good luck to meet a man so gentle
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm so sorry that today I have to go away
Sometimes when I wake at night I'm dreaming of another
Then I turn and touch him next to me
And I know where I belong; still I sometimes wonder
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm so sorry that today I have to go away

And it's something that's right out of my hands (My hands are clean)

Paul Kelly,"Sydney, 1926, this is the story of a man
Just a kid in from the sticks, just a kid with a plan
St George took a gamble, played him in first grade
Pretty soon that young man showed them how to flash the blade
And at the age of nineteen he was playing for the State
From Adelaide to Brisbane the runs did not abate
He hit 'em hard, he hit 'em straight 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

A team came out from England
Wally Hammond wore his felt hat like a chief
All through the summer of '28, '29 they gave the greencaps no relief
Some reputations came to grief
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
And in the hour of greatest slaughter the great avenger is being born
But who then could have seen the shape of things to come
In Bradman's first test he went for eighteen and for one
They dropped him like a gun
Now big Maurice Tate was the trickiest of them all
And a man with a wisecracking habit
But there's one crack that won't stop ringing in his ears
""Hey Whitey, that's my rabbit""
Bradman never forgot it 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

England 1930 and the seed burst into flower
All of Jackson's grace failed him, it was Bradman was the power
He murdered them in Yorkshire,he danced for them in Kent
He laughed at them in Leicestershire, Leeds was an event
Three hundred runs he took and rewrote all the books
That really knocked those gents
The critics could not comprehend hsi nonchalant phenomenon
""Why this man is a machine,"" they said. ""Even his friends say he isn't human""
Even friends have to cut something 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

Summer 1932 and Captain Douglas had a plan
When Larwood bowled to Bradman it was more than man to man
And staid Adelaide nearly boiled over as rage ruled over sense
When Oldfield hit the ground they nearly jumped the fence
Now Bill Woodill was as fine a man as ever went to wicket
And the bruises on his body that day showed that he could stick it
But to this day he's still quoted and only he could wear it
""There's two teams out there today and only one of them's playing cricket."" 

He was longer than a memory, bigger than a town
He feet they used to sparkle and he always kept them on the ground
Fathers took their sons who never lost the sound of the roar of the grandstand 

Now shadows they grow longer and there's so mush more yet to be told
But we're not getting any younger, so let the part tell the whole
Now the players all wear colours, the circus is in town
I can no longer go down there, down to that sacred ground 

He was more than just a batsman

And all around me felt like all inside me
And my body left me and my soul went running 
Have you ever seen Kings Cross when the rain is falling soft?
I came in on the evening bus, from Oxford Street I cut across
And if the rain don't fall too hard everything shines just like a postcard
Everything goes on just the same
Fair-weather friends are the hungriest friends
I keep my mouth well shut, I cross their open hands 
I want to see the sun go down from St Kilda Esplanade
Where the beach needs reconstruction, where the palm trees have it hard

For that one sweet promenade",From St. Kilda to Kings Cross,1991
Paul Kelly,"His mother always let him stay up late on Fridays. 
They would lie in her room together watching TV. 
Sometimes she fell asleep before he did and he'd be watching a talk show - one person talking, then another, then all this laughter coming from nowhere. 
Next thing he knew she would be shaking hime gently. 
'Wake up little one, wake up'. 
Saturday morning. So he'd get up, dress himself, put his shoes on and leave the house without breakfast. 
Breakfast always came later in other people's houses.
They had to catch two buses to reach their destination and the trip seemed to take forever unless he fell asleep along the way. When they got off at their stop they were in a bigger, brighter neighbourhood. 
The houses were a long was back from the street and some of them were hidden from view by big hedges. 
Looking down the street was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope. 
His mother guided him through this country. 
She knew exactly where to go. 
She carried in her bag a big, heavy ring full of keys - all keys to other people's houses.
She would turn one of the keys in the lock. 
Some of the doors needed two keys. 
Then presto, they were in. 
The houses had so many things in them yet still so much space. 
He like to rub his feet quickly on the thick pile then touch a door knob with one finger and give himself a small electric shock. 
In the first house they always went straight to the refrigerator. 
There were things in there he couldn't imagine anyone ever eating - strange looking pastes in jars and horrible concoctions in plastic. His mother would sit him down with a jam sandwich and a glass of milk, then set to work cleaning other people's houses.
And so they would go all day long from one house to another, his mother scrubbing, mopping, vacuuming, cleaning, tidying up, leaving him to his own devices. Often if no-one was home, she would play music on the stereo. There was one record she always put on and sang along to. 
It had two men and two women on the cover and they all looked sort of blonde except for one of the women had dark hair. 
The stereo flickered like the controls of a spaceship. 
Other houses were full of books and sometimes he was allowed to take one of the books down from the shelves and open it up. There were books on war and cricket and movie stars. 
He liked to look at the pictures and pick out big words that he knew. 
He was very careful with the books. 
He was very careful with everything in other people's houses.
Many of the houses had other children in them. 
They would rush right past him into the yard. 
He'd follow them out back where the backyard was as big as the house, sometimes even bigger. 
He'd play with them for a while then sit on the steps watching them. 
He felt slower than the others. 
There was a girl about his age who lived in a house they went to every second Saturday. 
Her name was Stephanie. 
She used to take him everywhere with her, wherever she went, all around the house, even into her room. 
He'd never see his mother until it was time to leave. 
One Saturday his mother told him Stephanie and her family had moved away. 
Just like that. He still thinks of her now, twenty years later, moving, laughing, sitting down to dinner, making conversation, making love in other people's houses.",Other People's Houses,1991

Meet me down by the jetty landing
Where the pontoons bump and sway
All the others reading, standing
As the Manly ferry cuts its way to Circular Quay
Hear the captain blow his whistle
So long you've been away
I miss our early morning wrestle
Not a very happy way to start the day
She don't like that kind of behaviour
She don't like that kind of behaviour
Throw down your guns
Don't be so reckless
Throw down your guns

Base camp so far away

Paul Kelly,"When I first met your mother
I was playing in a bar
She walked in with my girlfriend
My foolish girlfriend brought her there

She looked so pretty and dangerous
As she brushed back her hair
And I was not the only one
Taking notice in that bar

When I first met your ma
When I first kissed your mother
I was single once again
We walked through Fitzroy Gardens

There she took my hand
We could not stop our kissing
Then she whispered in my ear
'Soon you'll get to know me,

So let's not go too far'
When I first kissed your ma
Love like a bird flies away
You'll find out the only way

Love like a bird flies away
When we first lay together
Inside her father's house
We tired so to be quiet

As we held each other close
Then her dad came pounding and kicked me out of there
I walked two miles in Melbourne rain
I could have walked ten more

When I first loved your ma

You'll find out the only way

Sitting there all alone
With your glass of sorrow you seem so far from home
Maybe you will let me buy a round or two

We might know each other before the night is through

Will you take a chance

I might be mistaken but I see meaning in your glance
Maybe this could be the start of something new

I've done all the dumb things

Started howling, made no sense
Thought my friends would rush to my defence

An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uh-huh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law

Then one night in the dark she grabs hold of his hand
Says: ""There, can you feel it kicking inside?""

You made me promise to marry you, I made you promise to be my bride
But you were only eight years old and I had just about turned nine
I thought that life was always good, I thought you always would be mine 

It started with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this
It started with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this 

I remember every little thing, like fighting in the playgournd
Some good looking boys had started to hang around
That boy hurt me so bad but I was happy 'cause you cried
Still I couldn't help but notice that new distant look in your eyes
Then when you were sixteen I had just turned seventeen
I couldn't hold on to my love, I couldn't hold on to my dream 

It started with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this
It started with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this 

You don't remember me do you?
You don't remember me do you? 

Walking down the streets again, the star of my love sotry
And my heart began to beat so fast, so clear was my memory
I heard my voice call out your name as you looked then looked away
I felt so hurt, I felt so small, it was all that I could say 

You don't remember me do you?
You don't remember me do you? 

It started with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this
It started with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this

Sometimes when I get a moment
In the middle of the day
And nothing else needs my attention
I take my chance and slip away

I close my heavy eyes and that's all I need to do

I hear the big trucks changing gears
As they go rolling by my door
The driver counts his days 'til he gets home
If I could only count my days
But I just don't know what's in store
I've been so long on my own

I know there's a singing river
I've heard about the golden shore
But I would pass by all that beauty

Waiting for the thrill to return
Feeling your desire burn

And dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

It will flame out, like shining from shook foil
It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not wreck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod
And all is seared with trade bleared, smeared with toil
And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod
And for all this, nature is never spent
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things
And though the last lights off the black West went
Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
World broods with warm breast and bright wings

My heart full aching sore
The seagulls of Seattle
Wheeled above the shore
I stepped inside a tavern
For oyster chowder and brown ale
The hidden sun was sinking
Behind the distant sails

And in my mind dear memories
Like rolling waves unfurled
All the water places
I've been to with you, girl
The north-west by the Pindan
The salty, heavy sea
The days we laid on Cable Beach
And read beneath the tree
To the sandhills all deserted
Hand in hand we stole away
And there inside a shady glade
We made a bed to lay

Hot, sweet days in southern Spain
Fish and rice and wine
Swimming in deep water
Then later on entwined

I was covering the waterfront
Like John Lee in Days of Yore
The seagulls of Seattle
Wheeled and made their caw
I climbed a metal staircase
Searching for a better view
Puget Sound below me
Grey, not really blue

And looking west I raised you up
All sleepy from your bed
You were putting on the coffee pot
Brushing bad dreams from your head

I turned, then, from the harbor
And wheeled back into town
To meet my boon companions
And join with them in sound
Upon the lonely stage, I trod
The room all dark and dim
And every song I sang that night
To my love was a hymn

Wondering what I was there for

Were calling, evermore",Seagulls of Seattle,2018

Like something almost being said
The recent buds relax and spread
Their greenness is a kind of grief
Is it that they are born again
And we grow old? No, they die too

Is written down in rings of grain
Yet still, the unresting castles thresh
In full-grown thickness every May
Last year is dead, they seem to say

Begin afresh, afresh, afresh",The Trees,

An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides 

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor 

[Chorus]
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand 

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town 

[Chorus]

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uhuh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising 

[Chorus]

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life 

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait 

[Chorus]

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns 

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand 

[Chorus]

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law

Paul Kelly,"I still cry for Baby Jesus
And I still pray when I'm alone
And when I'm lost
He'll come to find me
Because he died to save my soul

When I can't walk he's there to carry
When I speak he hears my words
When I wake and I have nothing
He sends me gold, francencene and mer

When I cry my tears of sorrow
When my heart will only ache
And if I'm troubled when I'm sleeping
He will hold me until I wake","I Still Pray [Album Version w/ hidden track ""Ignorance""]",2001
Paul Kelly,"Gather round people let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides 

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor 

[Chorus]
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand 

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town 

[Chorus]

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uhuh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising 

[Chorus]

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life 

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait 

[Chorus]

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns 

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand 

[Chorus]

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law 

[Chorus: x2]",From Little Things Big Things Grow,2008
Paul Kelly,"Welcome, strangers, to the show
I'm the one who should be lying low
Saw the knives out, turned my back
Heard the train coming, stayed out on the track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Caught the fever, heard the tune
Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon
Started howling, made no sense
Thought my friends would rush to my defence
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

And I get all your good advice
It doesn't stop me from going through these things twice
I see the knives out, I turn my back
I hear the train coming, I stay right on that track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Paul Kelly,"I broke my bat on Johnny's head; somebody snitched on me.

 Bought some gum with a penny slug; somebody snitched on me. Oh,(chorus) 

 I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas.Mommy and Daddy are mad. 
 I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas,'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.(verse) 
 I put a tack on teacher's chair, somebody snitched on me. 
 I tied a knot in Susie's hair; somebody snitched on me. 
 I did a dance on Mommy's plants, climbed a tree and tore my pants. 

 Filled the sugar bowl with ants; somebody snitched on me. So,(repeat chorus) 
 (verse)I won't be seeing Santa Claus; somebody snitched on me. 
 He won't come visit me because somebody snitched on me. 
 Next year I'll be going straight, next year I'll be good, just wait. 

 I'd start now but it's too late; somebody snitched on me. Oh,(repeat chorus)

Paul Kelly,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Paul Kelly,"How many cabs in New York City, how many angels on a pin?
How many notes in a saxophone, how many tears in a bottle of gin?
How many times did you call my name, knock at the door but you couldn't get in?

I know I've been careless

I've been wrapped up in a shell, nothing could get through to me
Acted like I didn't know I had friends and family
I saw worry in their eyes, it didn't look like fear to me

I know I've been careless
I lost my tenderness
I've been careless
I took bad care of this

Like a mixture in a bottle, like a frozen over lake
Like a long-time, painted smile I got so hard I had to crack
You were there, you held the line, you're the one that brought me back

Then when he got laid off they really hit the skids

He took it pretty badly, she took both the kids
She said: ""I'm not standing by, to watch you slowly die
So watch me walking, out the door""
She said, ""Shove it, Jack, I'm walking out the fucking door"" 

She went to her brother's, got a little bar work
He went to the Buttery, stayed about a year
Then he wrote a letter, said I want to see you
She thought he sounded better, she sent him up the fare
He was riding through the cane in the pouring rain
On Olympic to her door 

He came in on a Sunday, every muscle aching
Walking in slow motion like he'd just been hit

Could he make a picture and get them all to fit?

Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls,"Sydney, 1926, this is the story of a man
Just a kid in from the sticks, just a kid with a plan
St George took a gamble, played him in first grade
Pretty soon that young man showed them how to flash the blade
And at the age of nineteen he was playing for the State
From Adelaide to Brisbane the runs did not abate
He hit 'em hard, he hit 'em straight 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

A team came out from England
Wally Hammond wore his felt hat like a chief
All through the summer of '28, '29 they gave the greencaps no relief
Some reputations came to grief
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
And in the hour of greatest slaughter the great avenger is being born
But who then could have seen the shape of things to come
In Bradman's first test he went for eighteen and for one
They dropped him like a gun
Now big Maurice Tate was the trickiest of them all
And a man with a wisecracking habit
But there's one crack that won't stop ringing in his ears
""Hey Whitey, that's my rabbit""
Bradman never forgot it 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

England 1930 and the seed burst into flower
All of Jackson's grace failed him, it was Bradman was the power
He murdered them in Yorkshire,he danced for them in Kent
He laughed at them in Leicestershire, Leeds was an event
Three hundred runs he took and rewrote all the books
That really knocked those gents
The critics could not comprehend hsi nonchalant phenomenon
""Why this man is a machine,"" they said. ""Even his friends say he isn't human""
Even friends have to cut something 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

Summer 1932 and Captain Douglas had a plan
When Larwood bowled to Bradman it was more than man to man
And staid Adelaide nearly boiled over as rage ruled over sense
When Oldfield hit the ground they nearly jumped the fence
Now Bill Woodill was as fine a man as ever went to wicket
And the bruises on his body that day showed that he could stick it
But to this day he's still quoted and only he could wear it
""There's two teams out there today and only one of them's playing cricket."" 

He was longer than a memory, bigger than a town
He feet they used to sparkle and he always kept them on the ground
Fathers took their sons who never lost the sound of the roar of the grandstand 

Now shadows they grow longer and there's so mush more yet to be told
But we're not getting any younger, so let the part tell the whole
Now the players all wear colours, the circus is in town
I can no longer go down there, down to that sacred ground 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide

Just washed my face and combed my hair
I had an eight-twenty-five train to catch
I was out there,
Flying thought the front door
Then I hit the air!

No you! No you! No you! No you!
No you, no you, no you!

Like an ant into a hole
I stood in the crowded carriage

Many lives I could have lived, many trails taken
It always seems that way at twenty-three
You walk into a room sometime and then a window opens
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
A morning train I had to catch, I just lay there sleeping
There was nothing in that town to hold me
By the time the clock had done another day of creeping
My life had changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm sorry that today I have to go away
Seven children I have raised, I love some more than others
The hardest thing to do is to set them free
So I learned my lesson hard seven times all over
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
I never was the kind of girl for acting sentimental
I never called our meeting destiny
I just call it good luck to meet a man so gentle
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm so sorry that today I have to go away
Sometimes when I wake at night I'm dreaming of another
Then I turn and touch him next to me
And I know where I belong; still I sometimes wonder
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm so sorry that today I have to go away

Paul Kelly & The Messengers,"In the morning we wreck the bed
You bring me coffee black and boiling

Kisses warm and tender
And I'd give up the word just to see you smile
One thing I will never understand (It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands (My hands are clean)
What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?
I went to town with a moody man, a handsome Dr. Jekyll
He was right by my side turning into Mr. Hyde
I ran for cover but I ran too slow; I was stitched by strangers
And they shook their heads that someone could do the things you did

Paul Kelly & The Messengers,"Sydney, 1926, this is the story of a man
Just a kid in from the sticks, just a kid with a plan
St George took a gamble, played him in first grade
Pretty soon that young man showed them how to flash the blade
And at the age of nineteen he was playing for the State
From Adelaide to Brisbane the runs did not abate
He hit 'em hard, he hit 'em straight 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

A team came out from England
Wally Hammond wore his felt hat like a chief
All through the summer of '28, '29 they gave the greencaps no relief
Some reputations came to grief
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
And in the hour of greatest slaughter the great avenger is being born
But who then could have seen the shape of things to come
In Bradman's first test he went for eighteen and for one
They dropped him like a gun
Now big Maurice Tate was the trickiest of them all
And a man with a wisecracking habit
But there's one crack that won't stop ringing in his ears
""Hey Whitey, that's my rabbit""
Bradman never forgot it 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

England 1930 and the seed burst into flower
All of Jackson's grace failed him, it was Bradman was the power
He murdered them in Yorkshire,he danced for them in Kent
He laughed at them in Leicestershire, Leeds was an event
Three hundred runs he took and rewrote all the books
That really knocked those gents
The critics could not comprehend hsi nonchalant phenomenon
""Why this man is a machine,"" they said. ""Even his friends say he isn't human""
Even friends have to cut something 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

Summer 1932 and Captain Douglas had a plan
When Larwood bowled to Bradman it was more than man to man
And staid Adelaide nearly boiled over as rage ruled over sense
When Oldfield hit the ground they nearly jumped the fence
Now Bill Woodill was as fine a man as ever went to wicket
And the bruises on his body that day showed that he could stick it
But to this day he's still quoted and only he could wear it
""There's two teams out there today and only one of them's playing cricket."" 

He was longer than a memory, bigger than a town
He feet they used to sparkle and he always kept them on the ground
Fathers took their sons who never lost the sound of the roar of the grandstand 

Now shadows they grow longer and there's so mush more yet to be told
But we're not getting any younger, so let the part tell the whole
Now the players all wear colours, the circus is in town
I can no longer go down there, down to that sacred ground 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side

I pressed my face against the glass and watched the white lines rushing past
And all around me felt like all inside me
And my body left me and my soul went running 
Have you ever seen Kings Cross when the rain is falling soft?
I came in on the evening bus, from Oxford Street I cut across
And if the rain don't fall too hard everything shines just like a postcard

Paul Kelly & The Messengers,"His mother always let him stay up late on Fridays. 
They would lie in her room together watching TV. 
Sometimes she fell asleep before he did and he'd be watching a talk show - one person talking, then another, then all this laughter coming from nowhere. 
Next thing he knew she would be shaking hime gently. 
'Wake up little one, wake up'. 
Saturday morning. So he'd get up, dress himself, put his shoes on and leave the house without breakfast. 
Breakfast always came later in other people's houses.
They had to catch two buses to reach their destination and the trip seemed to take forever unless he fell asleep along the way. When they got off at their stop they were in a bigger, brighter neighbourhood. 
The houses were a long was back from the street and some of them were hidden from view by big hedges. 
Looking down the street was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope. 
His mother guided him through this country. 
She knew exactly where to go. 
She carried in her bag a big, heavy ring full of keys - all keys to other people's houses.
She would turn one of the keys in the lock. 
Some of the doors needed two keys. 
Then presto, they were in. 
The houses had so many things in them yet still so much space. 
He like to rub his feet quickly on the thick pile then touch a door knob with one finger and give himself a small electric shock. 
In the first house they always went straight to the refrigerator. 
There were things in there he couldn't imagine anyone ever eating - strange looking pastes in jars and horrible concoctions in plastic. His mother would sit him down with a jam sandwich and a glass of milk, then set to work cleaning other people's houses.
And so they would go all day long from one house to another, his mother scrubbing, mopping, vacuuming, cleaning, tidying up, leaving him to his own devices. Often if no-one was home, she would play music on the stereo. There was one record she always put on and sang along to. 
It had two men and two women on the cover and they all looked sort of blonde except for one of the women had dark hair. 
The stereo flickered like the controls of a spaceship. 
Other houses were full of books and sometimes he was allowed to take one of the books down from the shelves and open it up. There were books on war and cricket and movie stars. 
He liked to look at the pictures and pick out big words that he knew. 
He was very careful with the books. 
He was very careful with everything in other people's houses.
Many of the houses had other children in them. 
They would rush right past him into the yard. 
He'd follow them out back where the backyard was as big as the house, sometimes even bigger. 
He'd play with them for a while then sit on the steps watching them. 
He felt slower than the others. 
There was a girl about his age who lived in a house they went to every second Saturday. 
Her name was Stephanie. 
She used to take him everywhere with her, wherever she went, all around the house, even into her room. 
He'd never see his mother until it was time to leave. 
One Saturday his mother told him Stephanie and her family had moved away. 
Just like that. He still thinks of her now, twenty years later, moving, laughing, sitting down to dinner, making conversation, making love in other people's houses.",Other People's Houses,1991

Sydney's in sunshine but it's cold as sin
Everyone walks leaning into the wind
On Crown Street I wait for my expensive friend
I can see by his eyes I'm in trouble again
I hurry down Broadway my time's drawing near
Come Independence Day I'm in the clear
Set 'em up Bruce, let's drink one more beer
'Cause I'm leaving her for the last time
I'm all done with walking the line
I'm leaving her for the very last time
And I'm through with reason and wine
I'm leaving her for the very last time
In more ways than one I was totally blind
Yes I admit that I missed every sign
Now my reputation has lost all it's shine
Lights on at Central, a train's heading south
I don't care if it looks like I'm running out
Set 'em up Bruce, this time it's my shout
I'm leaving her for the last time
I'm all done with changing my mind
I'm leaving her for the very last time
And I'm through with reasoning why
I'm leaving her for the very last time

Little boy you look so clear around the eyes
And what they've got in store for you
You may not realise
So be careful when you hear the voices call
Watch out little boy don't lose your balls
'Cause you never know the rules until you play
First they stroke you then they screw you,
Try to take your balls away
And once they've gone they're way beyond recall
Watch out little boy don't lose your balls

You may not even know you've

Paul Kelly & The Messengers,"Gather round people let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides 

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor 

[Chorus]
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow 

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand 

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town 

[Chorus]

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uhuh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising 

[Chorus]

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life 

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait 

[Chorus]

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns 

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand 

[Chorus]

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law

When I speak he hears my words
When I wake and I have nothing

The lonely nights

The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

On the pale drawn face, that was wrinkled and old

His uncombed hair, and eyes that would stare
At the people passing by, who didn't know or didn't care

This poor old man he's all alone
He's got no money or no home of his own
The back street's his kitchen
The footpath's his hall
And the chalk on the brick work
Are the pictures on his wall
He lays down his head
On the pavement that's his bed
And when he sleeps, his dreams fade away

He walks down the street, with his hands in his coat
Looking down at his feet, for a dog-end he could smoke
He thinks about food, good drinking and good fun
As he searches through the dustbins, his life almost done

How many times? Too many to recall.

How much can a man really take?
When he's pushed himself too far.
He knows that his mind is on the break.
And he's trying to reach that star.

How many times? Too many to recall.

Paul Kotheimer,"Rockefeller's busy giving dough away;
Chevrolet is busy making cars;
Hobo, you keep busy when they throw away
Slightly used cigars.
Hobo, you've no time to shirk.
You're busy keeping far away from work.

The weather' s getting fine.
The coffee tastes like wine.
You happy hobo, sing,
""Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!""
Why work away for wealth
When you can travel for your health?
It' s spring, you hobo, sing,
""Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!""
Your home is always near;
The moon's your chandelier;
Your ceiling is the sky,
Way up high.

The earth your little dinner plate;

Paul Kribbe,"My mind is clearer now
At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on, listen to me
Ah ah
Come on, listen, listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah ah",Heaven on Their Minds,1999

Paul Kuhn,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Paul Kuhn,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Paul Leim,"(Big John, big John)
Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Now, they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man

Paul Leim,"While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Evening to you Lord and watch us over tonight
Don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord,1999
Paul Leim,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999
Paul Leim,"The General just gave me a medal oh I'm a sight for mom to see
But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And men who've died for men on earth will get their heavenly dues
And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill
When I hang this medal around the neck of Oklahoma Bill",Oklahoma Bill,1999
Paul Leim,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?
Raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end,
Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna to bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch of the Master's hand.

You know threes many a man with his life out of tune,
Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving

There's more to life, there's got to be more to life

Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind

I stay true to the game

Transcend beyond the streets, the clubs, the trends
Beyond anything we had imagined

All is calm tonight 
New horizon, keep your eyes on those stars 
Lighting a way 

Take me somewhere out there 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride

Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Out of harm's way, where the traps all lay 
Tying you down, selling you out 
Beating you down - they're all over town 
Know your true self, or your truth might bend 
They will turf you out in the end 
Don't heed a word they say

Eat them slow, 'cos 
Every one's a prize!

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Mais ne savent pas qu'ils jouent
Quand entre chien et loup

En loups-garous,

Parfois leurs yeux s'allument
Quand passe une ingénue
Aux longs cheveux de lune
Qu'ils suivent dans la rue
À pas de loup,

Et bientôt dans leur c?ur tout bouge
Quand ils se voient tremblant
Au bras d'un p'tit chaperon rouge
Qu'ils habillent de blanc
Ils se croient apprivoisés
Installés
Dans un conte de fée
Mais rien n'est fini pour autant
Car la vie les attend
Pour leur faire les dents

Pour que jeuness' se passe
Ou sans raison du tout

D'aller faire la chasse

Avec ou sans lauriers

Et peuvent réciter
Même sans l'avoir appris
La mort du loup

Alors ils arrêtent leurs frasques
Et s'arrachent soudain
Le loup qui leur servait de masque
Et par un beau matin
Sa retrouvent à la croisée
Des chemins
Seuls devant leur destin
Et prennent la voie de leur choix
Qu'ils poursuivent tout droit
Sans reculer d'un pas

Vivent sans foi ni loi

Et tendu des calicots
Les comédiens ont parcouru les faubourgs
Ils ont donné la parade
A grand renfort de tambour
Devant l’église une roulotte peinte en vert
Avec les chaises d’un théâtre à ciel ouvert
Et derrière eux comme un cortège en folie
Ils drainent tout le pays, les comédiens

Dans une histoire un peu triste
Où tout s’arrange à la fin

Un peu de la sérénade
Et du bonheur d’Arlequin
Demain matin quand le soleil va se lever
Ils seront loin, et nous croirons avoir rêvé
Mais pour l’instant ils traversent dans la nuit

Paul Mauriat,"On a tous les deux
Couru le cotillon
Il est temps mon vieux
De baisser pavillon
T'as dépasser l'âge limite
La marge de sécurité
T'es un Don Juan mangé aux mites
Qui ferait mieux de se caser
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
La vigueur qu'à vingt ans tu as eue
Et ne peut plus atteindre le but
Qu'elles espèrent
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
Ta superbe, t'as l'air d'un vaincu
Et devant tes ardeurs disparues
Rien à faire
Tu n'as pas de ressort
Tu es triste à mourir
Et les femmes ont un corps
Assoiffé de plaisir

Ou est cet âge d'or
Qui connut tes désirs
Légendaires
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
Que la force de rêver sans plus
Seule ta mémoire a survécu
A la guerre
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
Un physique à leur crever la vue

-ne glace
Tu n'a plus, tu n'as plus
L'âge pour enflammer l'ingénue
Le temps des fredaines est révolu
Tu te tasses
Tu es ce fruit fané
Que nul ne veut cueillir
A quoi bon le presser
Pour n'en rien recueillir
Tu devrais te marier
Avant que l'avenir
Ne grimace
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
Le droit de te permettre un refus
Sans ardeur faudra du superflu
Mais en masse
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
Qu'à te faire une raison vois-tu
Elles sont nulles et sans avenues
Tes promesses
Tu n'as plus, tu n'as plus
Plus qu'à faire des enfants tant et plus
Car c'est ainsi que l'on perpétue
Sa jeunesse
Sur ton front dégagé
Luisant de mille éclairs
Si elles ne sont gâtées
Il poussera mon cher
Ces merveilleux trophées
Que l'on prend sur les cerfs
Qu'on dépèce
Tu n'as plus; tu n'as plus
Le moyen de les lancer aux nues
Aussi quand elles voudront leur dû
De caresses
Il te faudra payer leur vertu
En espèces",Tu Nás Plus,

Paul Mauriat & His Orchestra,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand, it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

Paul Mauriat & His Orchestra,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to

Look at the average person
Speak to the man in the street
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?

Well, I'm talking to a former engine driver
Trying to find out what he used to do
Tells me that he always kept his engine
Spit and polished up as good as new
But he said his only great ambition
Was to work with lions in a zoo
Oh to work with lions in a zoo
Yes dear, you heard right
Told me his ambition was to work with lions every night 

[Chorus]

Well, I met a woman working as a waitress
I asked exactly what it was she did
Said she worked the summer crowd at seasides
Winter time she ran away and hid
Once she had a Hollywood audition
But the part was given to a kid
Yes,the part was given to a kid
Yes sir, you heard it right
Hollywood ambition made a starlet grown up overnight

Well I bumped into a man who'd been a boxer
Asked him what had been his greatest night
He looked into the corners of his memory
Searching for a picture of the fight
But he said he always had a feeling
That he lacked a little extra height
(Could have used a little extra height)
Yes mate, you heard right
He always had a feeling that he might have lacked a little height

Can he see me sitting here? his mind is somewhere else. 

His friend have flown away, he's left out in the cold. 
He won't sit by my fire, he says he likes it in the snow. 
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow. 

It's getting dark outside, the old hand's going home, 
Has he someone waiting there? or is he living on his own? 
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow... 

White blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see, 
Oh white blanket covers the memory 
Of all that used to be. all that used to be. 
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way, 
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday. 

It's beautiful outside, a magpie looks for food. 
The old hand throws a crumb, 
Do you think he's found a friend? 
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow... 

White blanket, hiding the traces of paths he didn't take 
Oh white blanket covers the memory 
Of moves he didn't make 
Oh white blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see

But I won't get it, my great illusion 
Will vanish anyhow if I don't grab it now. 

Well I was hacking my way throughout the undergrowth, 
Juggling with my pride, 
When I saw Errol Flynn in a tiger skin, 
And I said you look satisfied!
Well he looked down at me from his motor home, 
And he gave me a dirty smile,

Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime, 
If I say I want to love you all the time. 
But with all these people listening in, 
I don't know where I ought to begin. 
Maybe we should have a secret code, 
Before we both get ready to explode. 
When you want me to love you, 
Just tell me to press. Press 

Right there, that's it. Yes. 
When you feel the stress, 
Don't just stand there. 
Won't you tell me to press?",Press,1986

Don't get me wrong.. 
I wait all night but you won't be long 
Don't get me wrong 

Hear me right. I love you from the bottom of my heart 
You make the answer bright 
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do 
If you'll only love me, I'll love you 

And if you're tempted to tell a lie 
Don't get it wrong.. 
Well it breaks my heart when I see you cry 
Don't get it wrong 

Get it right 
The brightest light that's shining in the skies 
Is shining from your eyes 
I love you in a way, that no-one else could ever do 
If you'll only love me, I'll love you 

I'm often accused of giving to little 
It's got me confused I'm split down the middle 
Conflicting reviews of our life coming in 
It's tough on a tightrope, Yes it's tough on a tightrope

Out there somewhere, you know I could swear

Saw your body rolled up in a rug 
Chopped up into two little pieces 
By some thug,

I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am
To the time on my hands,
Now I don't have to tell anybody
When I'm going to get back

Ever since you went away
I've had this sentimental inclination
Not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed,
I want to go bury my head
In your pillow

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place

Where I can't find my brave face,
Where I can't find my brave face,
My brave, my brave, my brave face

I've been living a lie
Unaccustomed as I am
To the work of a housewife,
I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and throwing them away

Ever since you left I have been trying to
Compose a 'baby will you please come home' note
Meant for you
As I clear away another
Untouched t.v. dinner
From the table, I laid for two

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again

And it didn't hit back.

I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am
To the time on my hands,
Now I don't have to tell anybody
When I'm going to get back.

Ever since you went away
I've had this sentimental inclination
Not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed,
I want to go bury my head
In your pillow.

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face,
Where I can't find my brave face,
My brave, my brave, my brave face.
My brave face.

I've been living a lie
Unaccustomed as I am
To the work of a housewife,
I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and throwing them away.

Ever since you left I have been trying to
Compose a 'baby will you please come home' note
Meant for you.
As I clear away another 
Untouched t.v. dinner
From the table I laid for two.

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face,
Where I can't find my brave face,
My brave, my brave, my brave face.

No one comes near.
