Lena,"Qué sensación tan extraña 
Aquella que sentí 
Al escuchar tu corazón 
Que falsedad la que engaña 
A todos en aquel viejo salón 

Por eso yo ya no se 
Qué voy a hacer sin tu amor 
Si no puedo escapar de esta llama que incendia mi cuerpo 

Yo ya no intento descubrir qué pasará 
Si prefiero morir que aguantar lo que siento 
Todo lo que yo llevo lo llevo por dentro 

Qué sensación tan extraña 
Llegó sin avisar 
Y acorraló mi corazón 
Qué escondes dentro de tu alma? 
Que me hace alucinar 
Y hasta perder la razón 

Por eso yo ya no sé qué voy a hacer sin tu amor 
Si no puedo escapar de esta llama que incendia mi cuerpo 
Yo ya no intento descubrir qué pasará 
Pues prefiero morir que aguantar lo que siento 
Todo lo que yo lo llevo por dentro 

Y grito a voces que te quiero 
Que me condenen a 100 años 
Que me destierren, si te beso 
Que me castigue Dios si peco (ay! si peco) 
Y grito a voces que te quiero! 
 
Que me condenen a 100 años 
Que me destierren, si te beso 
Que me castigue Dios si peco (ay! si peco) 
Y grito a voces que te quiero! 

Qué angustia siento en el alma 
Pues tengo que escuchar 
Cuando enverdad  quiero gritar 
Qué misteriosa la calma 
Se oculta en el umbral 
De mi ansiedad 

Por eso yo ya no se qué voy a hacer (ya no sé que voy a hacer) 
Sin tu amor (sin tu amor) 
Si no puedo escapar de esta llama que incendia mi cuerpo (mi cuerpo) 
Yo ya no intento descubrir qué pasará 
Si prefiero morir que aguantar lo que siento 
Todo lo que yo llevo lo llevo por dentro 

Que me condenen a 100 años 
Que me destierren si te beso 
Que me castigue Dios si peco 
Y grito a voces que te quiero!

Que me condenen a 100 años 
Que me destierren si te beso 
Que me castigue (Ay que me castigue!)
Dios si peco 
Y grito a voces que te quiero!",Tu Corazon (A Duo Con Alejandro Sanz),2006
Lena,"I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day

Love, you know I'll fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way

Love, oh love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh I
Can't go a minute without your love

Like a satellite
I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way

Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, oh love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh I
Can't go a minute without your love

Like a satellite
I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your

Love, oh love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh I
Can't go a minute without your love

Where you go, I'll follow
You set the pace, we'll take it fast or slow
I'll follow in your way
Oh oh oh

You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physics, there's no escape

Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Can't go a minute without your love

Lena,"You and I are cut from the same ice
Sincerity made us the perfect heist
Burning all the gold to sapphire skies
But the breeze is cold in paradise

I can feel the whispers in the street
Every night I shiver in my sleep
No reality, 'cause it's all a dream

Was it love?
It was wild
Brought me to my knees
Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things
I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy

Was it love?
It was wild
Brought me to my knees
Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things
I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy

Trying not to drown in your mistakes
So I leave it up to faithless fate
Travel waters, seize the hurricane
Rocking back and forth 'cause no one's safe

I can feel the whispers in the street
Every night I shiver in my sleep
No reality, 'cause it's all a dream

Was it love?
It was wild
Brought me to my knees
Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things
I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy

Lena,"Turn around, every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming round
Turn around,
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around,
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around,
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes,
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes,
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Lena Ericsson,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Lena Ericsson,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town

Lena Horne,"It's gonna rain any minute
There's not a star in sight
Things are mighty slow
I guess, I'll close up shop
And go home to Joe

I know he won't be glad to see me
Without a penny to the good
But I'm not carin' much what happens
I did the best I could
He's just good-for-nothin' Joe

But, oh, I love him so
Guess, I'd die if good-for-nothin' Joe
Ever tried to leave me flat
Oh yes, I'm certain of that

Folks I know can't understand
Why I must have that man
Lord, he sends me like nobody can
Ain't a woman just like that?

I wouldn't mind doin' what I'm doin'
I'd beat these streets till my feet were sore
But when it's slow and I go home to him
Instead of sympathy, he's just as mean as can be

Still there's nothin' I can do
Because I love him so
I'd be good for nothin' too, I know
Without good-for-nothin' Joe

I'd be good for nothin' too, I know
Without good-for-nothin' Joe
I'm goin' home to Joe",Good For Nothin Joe,

You for me dear,
Only two for tea dear,
From this moment on,

From this happy day,
No more blue songs,
Only hoop-de-doo songs,

Got the skin I love to touch

Lena Horne,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all dissappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,
Lena Horne,"In this cloudy sky overhead now
There's no guiding star I can see
And I would be lost by each wild tempest tossed
Oh, if I didn't know of a place we two can go

There's a little cabin in the sky, Mister
For me and for you
I feel that it's true somehow

Can't you see that cabin in the sky, Mister
An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow

We will be oh so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by

And that is why my heart is flyin' high, Mister
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky

""Ain't it the truth?

Cast your line!

You got to get your possum,

Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?

Lena Horne,"After one whole quart of brandy,
Like a daisy I'm awake.
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation,
I've done pretty well I think,
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. 

He's a fool and don't I know it,
But a fool can have his charms,
I'm in love and don't I know it,
Like a babe in arms.

Love's the same old sad sensation,
Lately I've not slept a wink,
Since this half pint imitation,
Put me on the blink.

I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I'll sing to him, each spring to him,
And worship the trousers that cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

When he talks, he is seeking,
Words to get,.off his chest.
Horizontally speaking
He's at his very best.

Vexed again, perplexed again,
Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heart's antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

Romance finis.
Your chance finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",1958
Lena Horne,"The farce was ended,
The curtains drawn,
And I at least pretended
That love was dead and gone.

To take my heart,
And break my heart once more.

Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love.
Get out of town,
Be good to mr please!

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm

Just disappear,
I care for you much too much,
And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!

And, Honey, there's love in me

There's honey in the honeycomb
There's nectar in the peach
There's candy in a coconut shell

Love is a spark lost in the dark,

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

The cows'll moo in the clover,

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The moon is takin' a header,

Now every time I think of Joy, I get all weird inside

Joy to the world was a beautiful girl
But to me Joy meant only sorrow

Now, if you haven't got an answer, you'd never have a question
And if you never had a question, then you'd never have a problem
But if you never had a problem, well everyone would be happy
But if everyone was happy, there'd never be a love song

Joy to the world was a beautiful girl
But to me Joy meant only sorrow

The other day, I met a girl named Joy
She said, ""Come here, I'm going to make you all clammy inside""
Well, things went good, things went bad
Things went good and things went bad
Good, bad, good, bad, good, bad

Lena Horne,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow,1988
Lena Horne,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1988
Lena Horne,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall in Love,1988
Lena Horne,"The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone",By Myself,1989
Lena Horne,"There they were, there they were,
He was baby-talkin' her,

Said the fella to his gal,
And the cuckoo in the clock went ""Cuckoo!

Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo!""

They didn't know that everything they said was overheard;
They didn't hear that little birdie givin' them the bird!

So he said with a sigh,
""Who's your little peachy pie?""

Lena Horne,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that
He said I'm gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible

To help with good Rocky's revival.",Rocky Raccoon,1990

And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny,1991

Cha-cha happy, but I'm lazy
I don't dig that frantic turpsichord

What I got in mind is a big improvement
With a very minimum amount of movement
Let the other couples push and shove
What I got in mind I think you're gonna love

I got a new-fangled tango

You just sort of stand there
And just sort of do it

You stand close together

An old fashioned motion

The floor may be crowded
But that doesn't matter
It's not necessary to move
Don't move, why move

It may be crowded
But that's all the better
It's just like romancing, while dancing
Who's dancin'

You start off with one step
And cling to each other
And you know how one step
Can lead to another

Oh, there's nothing wrong with
A waltz or fandango
But oh, what can come from
A new fangled tango

You cling to your partner
And sway to the rhythm
You can't lose your partner
'Cause you're right there with him

You don't have to be worry
About fast or slow steps
The nice part about it
In this dance, you don't need steps

You don't have to worry
If your dancing won't do
It's not what you do do
It's more what you don't do

You don't need a waltz

You didn't need me.

Just casually glanced into a window so high,

Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!

She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man

Started yankin' the bell!

Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""

Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good (no good)

Blow, ill wind, blow.

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you

There's a happy city, they say

And the diamond bushes thrive

Won't you have a slice of ham'
Marshmallows bloom, already toasted
And the clouds are made of marmalade and jam

Holding onto talking, saying nothing.
Knowing in a moment I could lose you.
Then without a warning I remembered that
You trembled at the touch of my hand.

She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to His Face,2007

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

No me ames, te lo ruego, mi amargura déjame
Sabes bien, que no puedo, que es inútil, que siempre te amaré

No me ames, pues te haré sufrir con este corazón
Que se llenó de mil inviernos
No me ames, para así olvidarte de tus días grises
Quiero que me ames sólo por amarme
No me ames, tú y yo volaremos uno con el otro
Y seguiremos siempre juntos
Este amor es como el sol que sale tras de la tormenta
Como dos cometas en la misma estela
No me ames
No me ames
No me ames

No me ames
No me ames
No me ames

This sensitive child is changing her style
The ugly duck is starting to smile

Open up your eyes, you sleeping beauties must arise
You're shaping up just fine
So climb inside a brand new life

Instrumental verse

But don't forget to wake me in time
You know I had a lot on my mind
These tired old eyes await a surprise
I wonder what the future will bring

This twilight seems like an eternity
The changes I go thru are hurting me
Do we become what we deserve to be?

Open up your eyes  - you sleeping beauties must arise
You're shaping up just fine
So climb inside a brand new life",Sleeping Beauty,1979

Let's face the music - I think that it's time.
What's the use, when the future looks so unkind.
Life and death - the choice we make.
Revolution - the line in my mind takes.

Win or lose, hey! what do you say.
Got to change, change, change, change.
Check it out and see - there could be a better lifestyle.
My hopes are big as the sky,
My dreams are wider than wide.
One day we'll be absolutely crueltyfree!

Rage!
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

What is this sad fascination,
To rip off another's skin.
Shame! shame! shame!
Fancy people in furcoat - what a pitiful sight.
Leather is dead - it's not so nice.

Rage!
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

Stop! think! before you chew.
Don't eat a creature, that won't eat you.
Food for everyone,
Let's all eat - it's so much fun.
Let that chicken be! a cow is not a factory!
Fast food slaughter - a criminal waste.
We've got to tune ourselves into a new morality.
Make some improvement on the human race.

Rage, each time I turn around.
Rage, it tears my heart apart.
Rage, each time I see the blood.
Hey, now! sentimental feelings are just not good enough.

March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.

Me busca el interesado 
Que cambios tiene la vida 
Mientras la moneda gira 
El de abajo va pa arriba 
Las sorpresas no te avisan

Me miran el centavo 
Hoy soy muy solicitado 
Se me pararon las moscas 
Porque calzo buen zapato 
Hoy con respeto es el trato 
Me salieron muy baratos

Mi celular nomas suena 
Y la agenda está muy llena 
Sobran las invitaciones 
Tantas son las amistadas 
No sé cuántos familiares 
Ahora vienen a buscarme 

Cuando miraban el piojo 
Nunca voltearon sus ojos 
Tuve que rascarme solo 
Más sigo siendo el sencillo 
Y al que venga por el brillo 
Dejo que se humille el solo 

Pocas sillas en mi mesa 
Y una palabra que pesa 
Vale más que todo el oro

Son pocos pero sinceros

No está con nosotros
Se le extraña y hablo de Manuel
Por los llanos y la ilama
Cuando todos patrullaban
Tenía como 30 camionetas
Formando las caravanas

Chalecos norincos
Y las cortas para trozar de volada

Deben de saber
No siempre fue malo
Fue un hombre de campo así era el
Le mataron su retoño
Y se le metió el demonio
Ese día de la muerte del cuatro marco
Al viejo y cambió todo

Por ondeado sus mismos contrarios
Le pusieron ese apodo

Con su gente al 100
Un bulto lavado
Y con su cuerno siempre a lado de el
Con El Picho coordinando
Los puntos se iban pasando

Cincuenta R1 en la fiel línea
Listos pa tirar vergazos
Y en Culiacán el Mele y su equipo
Levantando y fusilando

Puso el escalade
Por la ruta 15
Al comedero se movía Manuel
Una paloma empolvada
Por la higuera y por la palma
Montando a el espejo
Por los llanos, bailándolo con la banda
Campeón de la feria ganadera
Con Javier haciendo entrada

Recuerdo una vez
Cuando allá en el rancho
Con marinos se trenzo también
Qué bonito le atoraron
Un boludo les tumbaron
Balas volaron quemaron carros
Y logro salir a salvo
Y una vez se volteó un pistolero
Y ya no está para contarlo

Y aunque ya se fue
Pesa el apellido
Torres mencionado en el cartel
El de la retro en las cachas
Y el 14 que portaba

Do meu olhar pra fora
O mundo é só miragem
A sombra do futuro
A sobra do passado
Assombram a paisagem

Quem vai virar o jogo
E transformar a perda
Em nossa recompensa
Quando eu olhar pro lado
Eu quero estar cercado
Só de quem me interessa

Às vezes é um instante
A tarde faz silêncio
E o vento sopra a meu favor
Às vezes eu pressinto
E é como uma saudade
De um tempo que ainda não passou

Me traz o teu sossego
Atrasa o meu relógio
Acalma a minha pressa

To this Party in the Milky Way

Let's hit the solar road
Where's the moon now
We're lost in space

We've been lost for days
We're on a trip around the sun
With vodka, tractors and rock'n'roll
Food and drink for everyone

Travelin' around the stars

I'm so tired, surrounded by darkness, can't tell day from night
My mind wanders on, to times when our spirits will sing,
Come days of spring
Zastarovje, my friend, long time no see
I'll come alive when you drink with me
Oh Zastarovje, my friend
There's sun light dancing around,
Still the days move so slow
I wait for the moment when the ice starts to brake
And the river will flow
Music and laughter will soon fill the air once again,
Once again,

I met a beautiful senorita
Down at the place called.
I don't even knows what it means
All I knew it sounded great
I made an order, a bottle of whiskey
And a couple of cheap cigars
That waitress named Maria
Gave me a wink across the bar
* I said, ""Baby babe
 What would you like to?""
 She said, ""Nada""
I said, ""What?""
 She said she's workin' late
 But if you'd like to wait
 Then we can have one enchilada
Enchilada, enchilada, enchilada

Then a giant called Moses
Was standin' in front of me
I wondered why the roses
He said, ""Maria belongs to me""
He said, ""If you're lookin' for trouble
I'll throw you through the door""
So I grabbed my empty bottle
And I knocked him to the floor

And all macho poses

Lenka,"Roll, roll with the punches
Roll, roll with the punches

That really hurt me
Like a fist to the face
I wasn't ready
To be knocked out of place
Suddenly everything I was sure of
Sinking below the depths of the surface
It's unexpected, it usually is
When you're rejected
Or you take a hit
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

Little weapons over the phone
They like to threaten the life that I know
They say get over here and get into the ring
But I'm not really much a fighter
My mechanisms of defense are down
My resistance is out on the town
I was alarmed by your attack
This isn't a boxing match
But I'll be damned if I ever let you win

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

When all I want is a little stability
Some time without any bruises
You go and tell me the things that I don't want to hear
Putting your fist into my ears
Filling me up with the dread and the fear leaving you all in pieces
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to hold, hold, hold your head up high
When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches",Roll with the Punches,2011
Lenka,"Don't tell me you wanna be
The kind of girl who's drowning
And don't be holding on to anything
That's gonna keep you frowning, darling

Everyone's compelled to look into the mirror
When they're crying
Just because your tears are pretty
Doesn't mean they'll get you by

Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
Because everything feels like it's going around in circles
And everyone knows that the world is upside down

You were once a little baby
Full of optimistic wonder
So what got into you to make you think
That it could pull you under, honey

Could it be that we were under
The impression life was perfect?
And when the bubble burst
We understood that every part of it hurts

Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
Because everything feels like it's going around in circles
And everyone knows that the world is upside down

I'm going to color my glasses rose
I'm going to go where the rainbow goes
And my pot of gold will be waiting",Sad Song,2011
Lenka,"Just when you think that it will never get you
It comes and throws a lightning bolt right at you
Before you know it now your pulse starts racing
And now your blood is running hot like crazy

Oh, give it everything, everything that you've got

No, I never knew that I could feel this way
No, I never had it running through my veins
No, I never thought that it could be enough
Suddenly you, you shock me into love

It's waiting for you right around the corner
It doesn't have the decency to warn ya
It comes along and taps you on the shoulder
You fall the arms that now will hold ha

Oh, give it everything, everything that you've got

No, I never knew that I could feel this way
No, I never had it running through my veins
No, I never thought that it could be enough

Lenka,"Two, now that I'm with you
Another point of view
Instead of what I knew
Oh two, whatever will do
I don't see a way through
But your the one I choose
I never knew what double could do
But things are better, so much better

Hold me closer never let me go
I don't want any other, baby
Two is the one, two is the one
I was lonely never had nobody
But now I've got double, baby
Two is the one, two is the one for me

One, never had so much fun
Staying up till sun
Bangin' on my own drum
One, Always looking for love
And ending up with none
Made come true undone
I never knew what double could do
But things are better, so much better with two

Hold me closer never let me go
I don't want any other, baby
Two is the one, two is the one
I was lonely never had nobody
But now I've got double, baby
Two is the one, two is the one for me

Two, a couple not a few

Lenka,"She moved in to the house next door
Said she'd never been in love before
Tried the best she could to hide herself away

But every time she turned the lights down low
He thought he heard a voice calling out so slow
Come and take me away from all this pain
And he said

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart

You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Every morning when she came outside
He tried to be the one to catch her eye
But she would only turn away and hide

He started to concoct a plan
To get her to return the feelings that he had
To show her how he thought they were entwined

Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead

Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears

A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1

If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck

Black Macocco was the Pirate's name 
In his day, the tops was he 
Round the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea
When he sites a clipper ship 
Mack would board her and begin to clip 
First he'd grab, the ladies fair 
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare! 
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare 
Especially those with jewels 
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare! 
With his ladies and his loot 
Next Macocco from the ship would scoot 
Then he'd set the ship afire...what a pretty funeral 
Funeral pyre! 
Mack the Black, what a pretty funeral 
Mack the Black, marvelous funeral pyre! 
Though the years this black Macocco 
Lead his pirate reign 
His claim to fame was as black as his name 
All around the Spanish Maine 
When he'd a make his daily rounds 
Gals would trail him like a pack of hounds 
Ev'ry night he'd have a date Ladies go to pieces 
Over pieces of eight.
Hey! 
Sleep my baby, baby sleep 
Time for babe to be in slumber deep 
If you wake or cry or laugh 
Mack the Black will whack ya 
And he'll whack ya in half! 
Mack the black will really whack 
Mack the black will whack ya! 
Mack the black would really have to 
Whack ya in half! 
Mack the Black will really whack ya, 
Mack the Black will whack ya! 
Mack the black will whack ya 
And he'll whack ya! 
Aaaaaah! Mack was ruthless
Mack was feared 
Perhaps it's better that he disappeared 
Yet I know, that he was bad 
I could fall in love with,
Fall in love with the lad! 
Evening star, if you see Mack 
Stop his wanderings and guide him back 
I'll be waiting, patiently 
By the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea.
Is that the Caribbean Sea? 
And if I met this famous pirate 
Met him face to face 
You think I'd run and hide my head 
And scream around the place 
Why no I'd just sashay around 
Displaying all my charms 
And soon I'd have him walk the plank 
Right into my arms 
That's what I think of Mack the Black Macocco!",Mack the Black,

And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

And you'll never hear me complain;

But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling [*],2006

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

So if you see them anywhere

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Lennie Tristano,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1962
Lennie Tristano,"I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I've come
To complicate the dead
Are you with me?
I've written out all my vows again

We're almost home
To see the silence break on New Year's Eve
We're only 17
So if love exists I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To soothe the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame and life

And everything fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say, ""If love exists, I will fall?

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I'll wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love

I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

So alive, I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling
If love exists, I will fall

When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Lennie Tristano,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Lennie Tristano,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

",A Night in Tunisia,2000
Lennie Tristano,"You changed me and the way I felt about men
I was just so disgusted cause the one I loved I couldn't trust him
And you told me that if I never been hurt I would not know what happiness is
And just how good it feels

I was scared to give you all of me
Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

Yes I was so afraid
Going through the same thing again baby
I hate it to fall in love cause I have been through so many things I cant name
Same type, same thing, same game
But you showed me not to block my heart from every man that came walk up to me
Cause you were the right one for me

I was scared to give you all of me
Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

I never thought I would ever find love this
I had no trust at all cause ever man but you had did me wrong
Here's a wonderful thing
Since I let go of my past loves
I'm glad I gave you a chance to show me you're a good man

I was scared to give you all of me
Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

I was scared to give you all of me
Cause my last love he left me helplessly
Like a bird with out his wings I was just sitting around

Lennie Tristano,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Lennie Tristano,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.

Lennon ,"The feeling of coming to no one there
You rip off my clothes as you rip off my life
Destroyed my world in a matter of words
You left me waiting, you left me undeciding
You left me waiting, you left me waiting

I hear the knock at the door 
And I don't care who's not there anymore
This sound is driving me insane
And damn it nothing's going my way

We're at the point of talking about the morning
Trying to decide who's going to go
I think you forgot whose bed you slept in
And who is going home

Just take your clothes and I'll open the door
Looking around, you don't live here anymore

I'm not sure what I can be for you
Over some table in someone else's kitchen

Here's something I've been meaning to say
Yeah it's true, I've been living my life through you
But you can't even do that right, you're not living it my way

She says thank you for never even caring
I'll plan to see you all in hell 
She sits there saying those stupid words over and over again
Thank you for destroying me

What do you mean by your life, can't something belong to me

But where is the mother I truly need

One more step and I'll finally be free
He says if you want my help I'll give you that extra step

How did you become the man who made a woman of this child

It's 3:30 in the morning and I'm deciding to let this die
As I'm trying to take the pain out of my life
My orders were given and this case has been closed
So where are the calls to see if I'm alright
You are not a man but a devil in disguise

Where everything's fine all of the time
I wonder how it feels to be unafraid 
Day after day after it rains

Someday, somehow
Before too long
I’ll say goodbye to my burdens
I’ll fly beyond the sun

I wonder what it's like in the shade of a tree 
Shooting the breeze being carefree
I wonder what I’d choose if given the choice 
Between silence and noise
Words or a voice

Someday, somehow 
Before too long
I’ll say goodbye to my burdens
I’ll fly beyond the sun

Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice 
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry 
Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor 
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry 
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well Maybe just a half a drink more 
Put some music on while I pour

The neighbors might think 
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink 
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how 
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell 
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay 
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside

C'mon baby

I simply must go 
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no 
Ooh baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been 
I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm 
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious 
Man, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door 
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more 
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to go home 
Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb 
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand 
Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see 
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay 
Get over that old out
Ah, but it's cold outside

Baby it's cold outside

Brr its cold
It's cold out there
Cant you stay awhile longer baby
Well, I really shouldn't, alright

All of a sudden
She's gone in the flash of a light
I never was looking, hmm

You signed your name up on it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again

Before it stops fading

And it's like I used to doubt of you

Mami
A veces me pongo a pensar en ti
Y lo que me recuerdo son cosas malas 
Y todo el daño que me hiciste 
No te puedo decirte que te deseo lo mejor del mundo

Hoy de nuevo me acuerdo de ti 
Me visita la culpa tu rostro y la vieja pregunta 
Que porque después de tanto me duele mas que nunca?
(Porque me duele tanto)
Cuando pienso en ti, aquellas veces que me hacías sentir 
Como si viajara al mundo contigo
Y aunque me duele en el corazón
(Aunque me duela)
Y me ahogue en un mar de temor
Tratare de vencer el temor
(Y seré el vencedor)
Solo te diré una cosa
(Oye)
Te deseo el mal amor
(Eso es lo que tú te mereces)
Solo te diré una cosa
(Oye) 
Te deseo el mal amor 
Y aunque me duele en el corazón
(Aunque me duela en el alma) 
Y me ahogue en un mar de temor
Tratare de vencer el temor
Solo te diré una cosa 
Te deseo el mal amor 
Solo te diré una cosa
Te deseo el mal amor
(As sido muy mala conmigo) 
El mal amor
(Te deseo lo mismo que me as hecho, lo mismo que me has causado) 
(El príncipe, esto es insomnio, Lennox) 

Navegante en este mar de dolor 
Donde no existe amor, donde reina la desilusión
Mírame estoy muy mal deseo que estés igual 
Para que así tu comprendas el daño que me as causado amor 
?
Estoy agobiado lleno de lamentos
Pasando de lo nuestro que ya esta muerto 
Y gracias a ti ya no creo en el amor 
Yo soy la victima en esta ocasión 
No recuerdo haber sido mal amor 
Esto es extraño, ya no lo aguanto 
Puedo dejarte en este mar de dolor

Un recuerdo que me llega muy dentro de mi corazón navega 
Es como si prendo el motor pero el avión 
Nunca despega
Es como si voy en un tren, sin dirección 
Y sin la vía esperando un chin de agua 
En corazones de sequía
Me conoces 
Y sabes que era loco por mirarte 
Ahora olvidarte como yo 
En pa' cal y vivir en un mundo aparte 
Donde nadie sepa las angustias que yo siento 
Te deseo lo mejor sabiendo que en verdad te miento
Ojala te pasen todas las cosas que a mi me pasaron 
Problemas, depresiones...quizás ya se te olvidaron
Donde quieras que estés quiero que entiendas 
Y sepas que ya e cerrado mi corazón 
Para que mal nunca quepa

Jamás volveré a pensarte, e decidido olvidarte ya 
Borrarte ya
Todos los sacrificios que no sabistes 
Valorizar, que mal te vaya 
Cuando no encuentres alguien 
Que te sepa amar
Hay es que me vas a recordar 
Pero lo siento porque será muy tarde ya 
Cuando no encuentres alguien 
Que te sepa amar
Hay es que me vas a recordar 
Pero lo siento porque será muy tarde ya

Ojala que te enamores de los besos 
Te enamores de las flores 
De un poeta que te vende un mundo 
De cien mil colores
Nunca selles un amor perfecto 
Vivan como reyes 
Para después yo ver como a los dos 
La nave se le estrelle 
Lo profundo, yo mientras mas te odio 
Mas me hundo 
Porque se que por tu culpa 
Yo ando solo en este mundo 
Voy perdido, me han dicho mil rumores 
Al oído, mil enfangues que tú te has tirado 
Y ahora si e sentido lo que hiciste
Yo triste me sentido, como mierda un cero a la izquierda
Y es garantizado que yo te pierda 
Pero, dicen que el amor 
No mezcla con el vino 
Mi may me dice 
José mas alante hay mas vecinos 
Vive gente 
Un amor para cada cual es diferente 
A veces nunca llega pero por lo menos 
Casi siempre cuando te enamores 
Tú debes siempre recordar
Que cada cuento tiene su principio y su final

Tan solo quiero que lo entiendas

No estas conmigo

Se acabo

Solo quedan lamento
La nostalgia me atrapa

Cuando te recuerdo
Mi corazón y mi mente
No se ponen de acuerdo
Sin ti me vuelvo loco

Y contigo estaba loco si te pienso
De ti me acuerdo
Aunque tuve que entender
Que no hay nada eterno
Tu sabes que aquí me tienes
Calientito pal invierno

Me equivoque sin saber yo
Porque porque yo quiero estar mas
Contigo te lo digo ya

Me equivoque sin saber yo

Y yo la vaya tirar, se lo voy a dar te

Vela, blanca, rosa de camino a la cama 
Si tenerte es un sueño, quiero soñar a ver si me pasa 

No dejemos que el tiempo pasa y las esperanzas se acaben 
Lo que sentimos a merita vernos una vez más 
Para juntos viajar hacia los lugares donde siempre me pedías (siempre me pedías)
Siempre me pedías que te enseñara el mundo, que tu si me querías 

Sé que no te tengo aquí y que tu estas bien allá 
Se nota que mueres por mí, eso no lo puedes negar 
Dame una noche, aunque sea la última 
Que necesito, probar tus labios una vez más 

Hay amores que pasan y otros nunca se olvidan 
Ellas en mi historia son otras y tú eres la dueña de mi vida 
Me llevas a la luna, lo hacemos en las estrellas 
Tu vales más que mi fortuna, no existe quien borre esa huella 

Vivo esperando tu llamada 
Un ratico contigo, que nadie sepa nada 
Tus amigas me dicen que tu mirada 
No brilla como cuando a mi lado estaba 

Vamos a saciar todas estas ganas 
Ambos sabemos que hacer y no hacemos nada 
Vamos a saciar todas estas ganas 
Ambos sabemos que hacer y no hacemos nada 

Buscando palabras que te convenzan 
Esa es mi misión y la voy a encontrar 
Tu miedo es saber a la vez que se empieza 
Difícil se te hará terminar 

Sé que no te tengo aquí y que tu estas bien allá 
Se nota que mueres por mí, eso no lo puedes negar 
Dame una noche, aunque sea la última

Baby te confieso que a veces me desespero
W, La Z y la L

Solo tú, sabes jugar con mi mente, me conoces perfectamente
Seductora, siempre yo caigo en tu juego
Y yo, deseoso por tenerte
Estoy más que consiente, que los dos estamos jugando con fuego

Porque cuando tú me besas se me olvida, que eres prohibida
Mantengamos el secreto mi bebe
Para vernos otra vez a escondidas, aunque sé que eres prohibida
Vente conmigo y olvídate de él

Baby no quiero testigos, tú me tocas y yo sigo
Que solo somos amigos, pero yo quiero contigo
Tu punto débil lo consigo, no te obligo
Yo solo quiero abrazarte y darte castigo (prendelo)
Él no tiene lo que yo te doy
Ella sabe quién yo soy, el que la pasea en el Rolls Royce
Mi modelo de Playboy, sabe dónde yo estoy
Está lloviendo de seguro llama hoy
El flow italiano, la cartera en la mano
Casi siempre gano cuando me llama temprano
Yo la busco, nadie me ve, todo un veterano
Me besa por el cuello, a mí me encanta como jugamos

Y me ve, en la disco te encontré, tal como te soñé
El sudor en tu piel me dice que quieres ser mía
Y sé, que te encanta que te dé y que te haga mi mujer
Una noche de placer, ya que conmigo no sientes vacío
No sientes vacío

Te quiero dar placer (una y otra vez)

Tengo un lugar secreto, donde podemos hacerlo discreto
Hagámoslo duro en el concreto, siempre serás mía lo decreto

24/7 en busca de una dama
Se me olvida la fama y el trago se derrama
Y sigo guayando y bailando hasta que los pies se me inflaman
Yo sé que tú quieres, yo también quiero
No pongo, pero quiero ser el primero
Si me pides un beso, lo exagero
Tú sabes, el vaquero
El que anda con la cubana y el sombrero

Ahora es que tú te mueves solita, tu cuerpo lo necesita
Ahora es ponte una mano en la cadera

Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key

It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!

Fallen leaves in the night, who can say where they're blowing
As free as the wind and hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide has no way of turning

More than this there is nothing
More than this, tell me one thing
More than this there is nothing

And it was fun for a while, there was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night who can say where we're going
No care in the world, maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide has no way of turning

More than this there is nothing
More than this, tell me one thing

Lenny Breau,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Tenderly.
The trembling trees embrace the breeze,
Tenderly.
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in sigh were we.

The shore was kissed by sea and mist,
Tenderly.
I can't forget when two hearts met,
Breathlessly.

And  closed me in..side.

Lenny Castro,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2009
Lenny Castro,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at eventide,
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on earth to me.
