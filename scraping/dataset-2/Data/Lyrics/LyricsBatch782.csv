Walk in the house, lights are off
In the closet by the door, there's your coat
I wasn't thinking of you before
Too many rooms in this house, so I keep going out
What the hell is that about?
We gotta find a way to be okay

And maybe I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'm gonna break all of the china
'Cause it's just one more reminder you're gone, you're gone

When I get home, TV on
Drink in my glass, better make it strong

Did you plan that your timing's perfect?

But it'd mean that I would wanna let you go
And I don't wanna let you go
I could put a sign in the lawn
But it'd mean that I would wanna let you go

I'll close my eyes and dream of where you are

When we touch, when we kiss 
When we shut up for a moment (Turn out the light)

You on me or nothing (We got tonight)

Don't say anything at all 

Use your tongue to wet your lips 
Touch them with your fingertips 
Don't say nothing else 
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up 
Only want to hear your breath 
Your sigh, your scream, you're nothing less 
Don't say nothing else

All my life I thought a love like this would last
But every road can hide a corner we can't see
I had a vision that I woke up by your side
I felt you're breathing and our souls were intertwined

Not me

We had the room to fly and still the place to land

That don't leave me hanging up
I'm reaching out and praying you'd come back again

And you're the only place my heart has ever been

Maybe I'm longing in a way of love naive
Maybe I'm desperate for a reason to believe
There wasn't anyway I thought that we would fall
I've seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky
I've seen a child make the coldest grown man cry
But loving you I thought was greater than them all
And we had it all, just you and me
Now there's a doorway to me heart without a key

And so I'm calling now, I'm calling now

So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're cold as ice
My mother will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just one drink more, put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink, no cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir, mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried, what's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay, baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, ooh baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been, I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more, never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home, oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, it's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand, I feel when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died

I don't want to leave you with the shadow of a doubt
Did I ever give you the strength you've given me?
And how can I begin to make each moment mean the most so you will see
I never loved you more then I do today
Sometimes life just seems to get in the way

It's been too long
I want to sit down and write for you a perfect love song
I want to shout it out in a silent crowd
I want to move you in a million ways
I said to you everyday did I ever tell you I love you that way

And did I ever tell you I'm better to have known you
I don't want to change you cause I proud of who you are
And should you ever question the pain we are going through
What I need to mention is that life just isn't living without you
You know that I want you more than anything
Sometimes I just forget to say what I mean

When she was married herself nearly twenty-seven years before

Stayed up all night, but they got it finished just in time

Now on the arm of her daddy, she's walkin' down the aisle
I see her catch my eye and give me a secret smile
Maybe it's too old fashioned, but we once were close friends
Oh but the way that she looks today, she never could have then

Shakin' hands all around with a glassy look in his eye

It will make the hardest-hearted of critics' hearts melt

I looked so good and I dressed so snappy
Two-tone shoes on my feet big old smile on my face
As I moved and grooved all over the place
Now I'm down in the heels my complexion is bad
'cause my love life is sadder than sad

Yes darling I know it won?t be easy
But I won?t rest until I find a way
Everybody knows Rome wasn?t built in a day

How I?ll make it happen I?m not certain
I?m working on a plan
And when I get it tight you?ll believe that I?m your man

You don?t know it yet but you?ll surrender
When I make my play 
But everybody knows that Rome wasn?t built in a day

I?ll offer you protection
24 hours of inaffection
But it?ll take time to make it right

When he built his pyramid
Everybody knows that didn?t spring up over night

There?ll be a celebration
And a silver band will play

'Cause they wake up every morning with the cradle in their hands
But they pretend it's a game
Acting like the only place the truth could ever live was up on Shacklewell Lane

Oh there's a field, meet me there
Please come along, tie back your hair

I tried yesterday, it takes me so long to say, but I need you to know
Darling you show, by leaving me so, the only way to hold on is keep letting go

Oh there's a field, meet me there
You know I'm on my way, please meet me there

Oh there's a field, meet me there
Out beyond rightness and wrong, meet me there
I'm on my way, meet me there
Please come along, tie back your hair

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Nick Sullivan,"Gentlemen, we need to sell more papers
There's an answer right before your eyes, but you're just not thinking this through
Nunzio knows, when he's cutting my hair
Trim a bit here 
And then trim a bit there
Just a modest adjustment
Can fatten the bottom line

What if we cut back personnel?

How about a few salary trims?

We could lower the price of the paper

Bankrupting me even faster
Let me try again
Shaving is tricky: The razor should float
Shave me too close 
And you may slit my throat
Its the simplest solutions
That bolster the bottom line

I've got it 
If we charge the Newsies sixty cents per hundred instead of fifty

They'd have to sell ten more papers just to earn the same amount as always

My thought exactly
It's genius

It's gonna be awfully rough on those children

They'll be learning a real life lesson in economics 
I couldn't offer them a better education if they were my own
Give me a week and I'll train them to be
Like an army that's marching to war
Proud of themselves and so Grateful to me
They'll be begging to pay even more
When there's dirt on our shoes, boys
For God's sake, relax
Why throw them out?
All we need is some wax
Listen well to these barbershop lessons
For they'll see you through

When you're stuck in the muck you'll be fine
You'll erase any trace of decline

With a trim

And a snip

And a shine

And the power of the press
Yes, once again is mine
The price for the Newsies goes up in the morning
Just a few common cents
Gents, that's the bottom line

Every new outcome
It's income for you
Thanks to that bottom line",The Bottom Line,1992

And fire

Like trains in the night 
I caress where my lover once lay by my side 
Before I turned inwards and forced her to fly 
After the cold night the raindrops that froze 
Melt into the thin air 
Like the footsteps of ghosts

Well, believe me I've tried but there's no explaining, 
Eyes piled up you look like a painting, 
Saintly and sexy, the soft-spoken wind blows, 
Uncertain curtains cover broken windows, 
In desperate need of a safe haven and inflamed, 
I walk around Paris, unshaven and ashamed, 
20 odd years since last time I slow danced, 
Teenage crisis and the end of romance, 

I see myself in the form of a wolf, 
Furry, down on all fours and worried, 
Uneven colours and the echoes of fly tones
Connections I've lost in a collection of jawbones
Apples and oranges, you decide which, 
I'm writing graffiti on suicide bridge
I once knew a woman who was clever and tough
Who said too much make up is never enough
Her eyelids were heavy with words and desire
She lives underwater with the birds and the fire
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche
If you like love you'll love this, most likely

You and me are meant to be, that's right I love you, 
Can't you see, whatever partner you do choose, you have the ability to marry, 
6, 7, 8, I'll never hurt you, you know.
Husbands love their wives, 
Yeah, love the woman, 
Part of me is here with you, 
One life, where my heart beats for you, 
Well, here we are again, 
Here's a couple, treacherous
I'm impatient in relationships in and love
When will you see quand allez-vous me voir

Tell me what is it is, Gee Whiz, I don't think I know.

Bird girl, sorry I'm too sleepy to make
But the sounds of my dreams always keep me awake
Don't wanna scare the birds away so I speak soft
Memories like the shows of Vanessa Beecroft
Her bedroom philosophies are so perplexing
But I think these two wooden legs are so sexy
Cries of sadness, spectacular 
You be Rossy de Palma and I'll be your Dracula 
Fist is of agony decorate the last room
Shoes by the door, on the floor is your costume
Open the trunk with the car key, the odd way
Love songs, call me the marquee de shad
Lord of the files, you lost me I wonder how 
Midnight, meet me at the entrance for the underground
So many questions, but I'm afraid to ask
So I whisper them to apollinaire by Picasso
I touch all the flowers and break the chain
I wish I could fly, but I'd rather take the train
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche
If you like love you'll love this

You wouldn't tell me what it was because
I don't think you know",Gee Whiz,2011

In your memory.

Every word decreed
Every spell that's broken
Every golden deed

All the parts we're playing
Binding as the reed
And wild leaves are falling

As the campfire's burning
As the fire ignites
All the moments turning
In the stormy bright

Well enough the churning
When enough believe
The coming and the going

And all of her roses had bloomed
Looking at him as he came rushing in with them

It was one she could understand

On his mother's knee

And quietly started to read
Then seeing a picture of Jesus he cried out

And luck had his number drawn

My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye.

Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;
There oft as mild Evening sweeps over the lea
The sweet scented birk shades my Mary and me.

Though thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides, 
And winds by the cot where my Mary resides,
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,
As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear wave.

Nickel Creek,"I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves.
I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way.

I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past.
I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts.

I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea.
We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me.

And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light.
And they loved each other,
And with me watched the sunsets into night.

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea.
And the winds that blow remind me,
Of what has been, and what can never be.

She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return.
But when the night came,
The weather to a raging storm had turned.

He watched her ship fight,
But in vain against the wild and terrible wind.
In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end.

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea.
And the winds that blow remind me,
Of what has been, and what can never be.

Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the shore.
He kissed her cold face,
That they'd be together soon he'd swore.

I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand.
And then he climbed my tower, and off of the edge of me he ran.

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea.
And the winds that blow remind me,
Of what has been, and what can never be.

I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves.
And though I am empty, I still warn the sailors on their way.",The Lighthouse's Tale,2000

Feeling this sort of a love that we once knew
I'm calling this home when it's not even close 
Playing the role with nerves left exposed

And standing on a darkened stage
Stumbling through the lines
Others have excuses
But I have my reasons why

We get distracted by dreams of our own
But nobody's happy while feeling alone
And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall
We lean another ladder against the wrong wall

And climb high to the highest rung
To shake fists at the sky

Early in the springtime we round up the dogies
Mark 'em and brand 'em and bob off their tails
Round up the horses, load up the chuck wagon
Then throw the little dogies out on the long trail

Here with me

And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)

And I love your lack of self respect
While you're passed out on the deck

It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why

And I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease

And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say ""No"" too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

You can sing along

Give me lessons on how to breathe

That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring is on my hand
It was given to me by her

And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher

The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time I had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must of done it half a dozen times

Should I go back and try to graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back then

Blew every dollar that we ever made

They said somebody went and burnt it down

And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel

I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't even know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you I've been kissing

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in

You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt we're heading south
I guess nobody taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'

Look at the trouble we're in

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered, ""what was that""
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin',
""That's my dad outside the car""
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
We were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing

My mind was closing, now I'm believing

To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will

I'd search forever just to bring you home,

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

And tomorrow was too late

Don't wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends

And hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down
So we can do it all again

You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out
Just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

You better hang on if your taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Just not tough to put the brakes on,
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out

We drink up, we fall down

Then watch the walls begin to breathe
I can taste the colour of the lights
Wings are growing out of me
The floor is floating underneath
I can see the future burning bright
Future burning bright

The ceiling has us mesmerised
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
Yet suddenly we're travelling

A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour

When shadows all start breaking free
No longer held by gravity
How did we get so far from the ground?
Speaking to the galaxy
Received and sending back to me
I can finally hear the speed of sound
Speed of fucking sound

I like this everlasting pill
'Cause time itself is standing still
Why's the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no one calls
'Cause you and I are tripping balls
I can still hear ringing in my brain
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
See no signs of ever coming down
And suddenly we're travelling

A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour

Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The particles are dancing all around
I can't deny the hardest thing for me
Is finding time to finally breathe
See no signs of ever coming down
Another wave is coming in

Nicki Denner,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

You had to deceive
Yeah, you had to break all the rules

So many secrets from me
Baby, just this one time
Can you tell the truth?

'Cos there is just one thing
I need to know

Bitch I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut ya club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cakin' it
And I'm cakin' bitch, so tell me why I take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby, not the one she was in labor with
She say 'oh you taste good', I say 'oh just savor it'
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit

Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tech 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine. hit em wit a Tommy so my n****s call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby

This is for my n**** 7-up in Castaki
This is for my n****s wheeling them Kawasakis

Kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda c***y.

Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say s***
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say s*** put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say s*** but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them b****es just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a b****.

Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads wont give me my props
Twenty five on the bank I be stunting on there a**
And they mad cause the b**** won't stop

Hello, good morning, how you doing? What the move is?
Welcome to the future I'm the captain of the cool kids
The revolutions never been televised
Great booty better thighs I ain't wanna tell her bye
First, I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell her lie the night you couldn't find a better guy
King s*** fly to anywhere you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip checking in a 5 star suite with some 5 star freaks
Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V
I was in the back when y'all sleep
In a fast car super bad broad back seat
That's me, see I'm nothing nice, f*** a couple nights
See the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like

Hello, Good morning
Lets go, lets ride,
Hello, good morning
Hello, good evening
You blow, you feindin'
Cause you know that your really needed
And I'm the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby you dreaming
Wake up and turn the lights off

Cause I've been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads wont give me my props
Twenty five on the bank I be stunting on there a**
And they mad cause the b**** won't stop

You let me win,
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
And when they lookin'
You let me hide.
Defend my honor
Protect my pride.
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater.
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money,
Just get my weight up.
Know when I'm lying,
Know when I'm crying
It's like you got it
Down to a science
Why am I trying
No you ain't buying,
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance.
You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at you
And getting at you
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at you.
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you.

Could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki
And I say who me?
And you say no you
And I say screw you.
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But whats the reason.
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question,
Class is in session,
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind,
Capture my soul
OK your right
Just let it go.
OK you got it,
Its in the can.

You knew my hand.
You could turn a free throw into a goal.

Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract is on but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dogs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha
I'm the best now,
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel

Too much for the world so they a-bbreviate him
His tatts is her fav', his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per' uh

You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your B.M.W. every time you came through
You was the braveheart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor
Money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit
But its still fuck the media

'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life

This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell its time
Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive.

You let me hide.
Defend my honor
Protect my pride.
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater.
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money,
Just get my weight up.
Know when I'm lying,
Know when I'm crying
It's like you got it

Why am I trying
No you ain't buying,
I tried to fight it

You make me hoarse

Throwing them at you.

And you start leaving

Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind,
Capture my soul

Got the old school ho's
Acting brand new sweating
Brand new tennis chain, fancy pockets on my jeans
Headed for the walk dude, fore' they win him on the stage
Two a day, super pay
Stupid brain from a model
Triple see a hundred deep
And everybody got a bottle
Got a bottle full of purp
Full of work, no leachin'

Nicki Minaj,"Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch talkin' bout burr
I'm talkin' homegirl be lookin' like she just stepped outta a magazine
I'm talkin' niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious

Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

[Chorus]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realist nigga walkin'
And this the remix and still I'm out here lookin'
For a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her
With a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

[Chorus]

See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick
She been strugglin' for hers
From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like Coming To America
All my Louis luggage
You see my bag, how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin' on to E-Trade

[Chorus]

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' fuck 'em, with a dildo sign
Bye little Mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen
Barbie
I'm hot I think its time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin' and leavin'

You let me beg, for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean

I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me you’ll see you reap everything you sow

You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

I'm back to thugging, bitches, back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter while writin' my next chapter
Fast cash life, happily ever after

Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy
I went back to the projects, and two mill in Mercedes
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seat

Looking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, LV, logo
Middle of July but the wrist on snowflow
Only do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
I'm sunny and you must suck collagen dose, Calogero
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin
She said ""You're only Cam'ron,
Girlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere
So don't go tampering, you're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl, watch your manners
She run and tell her mama, ""I think I love him, Nana.""
Because you sat upon my lap?
Nah, I ain't Santa hope they call me my piper, OJ no glove I knife her
Never be a lifer, even do right
Why would I fight her? Don’t even like her

Nicki Minaj,"He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas ’cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, bald like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing-sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up North when they ratted
Anyway I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that’s seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I’m Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That’s top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers, I’m in the zone

They holler at me, but it’s you, you, this ain’t high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want, whip it whenever you want
Baby it’s yours
Anywhere, everywhere, baby it’s your world, ain’t it? (alright)
Baby it’s your world, ain’t it?

Uh, she got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her  “make me some money”, she tell me “make me a wife”
I tell that bitch “you crazy, fuck wrong with you?”
And excuse my French, but I’m a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I’m the only one that’s hitting
And I say “what about them niggas?” She say: “what about them niggas?”
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don’t judge me, I’d get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I’mma need goggles
She tell me that’s it’s mine, I tell her “stop lying, mine and who else?”
She say worry about yourself Lil Tune

They holler at me, but it’s you, you, this ain’t high school

Baby it’s your world, ain’t it?

Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head
I'm in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I'm gone
Take it to the head
I'm in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I'm gone
Now we gon' get f***ed up, no excuses no apologies",Take It to the Head [Edited Version],2012
Nicki Minaj,"[Chorus]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh yo, yo,
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

[Chorus]

Uh yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

[Chorus]

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

Me, I'm that bitch that be footing the bill
Only a real nigga could cop a feel
Credit Card blacker than that nigga Seal
25 Million to broker the deal
Jewish my lawyer, he Kosher, the deal
And I am still poppin' them pills
I don't give a fuck how you bitches feel
Jealousy, jealousy that's how you feel?
I am still living in Beverly Hills
Tell 'em to chill, tell 'em to chill
Tell all them people, my wrist is on chill
Bitches can't beat me, they ain't got the skill
Eye of the tiger they ain't got the kill
Look up to Jada, I love her and Will
Bitches my sons but they not in my will
The fuck be wrong with these bitches?

Yo no te dije ni una frase de amor
Y no digo que sea ilógico
Pero esa noche tu cuerpo pidió calor
Sin romance nada bíblico
No te lleve serenata a tu ventana
Ni escribí mil poesías en bachata
Solo te vi, me miraste así
Nos hicimos sentir un ratito feliz
