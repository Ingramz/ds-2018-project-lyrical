Meat Beat Manifesto,"The handshake
Seals the contract
From the contract
There's no turning back
The turning point

Grab all they can
All for themselves

It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts 
The graph
On the wall
Tells the story
Of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit
Gained a little more power
Confidence
Taken in
By a sun tan
And a grin

Meat Beat Manifesto,"So you want to jump out your trick bag
And ease on into a hip bag
But you ain't just exactly sure what's hip
So you start to let your hair grow
Spend big bucks to cop you a wardrobe
But somehow you know there's much more to the trip

[Chorus]
What is hip?
Tell me, tell me if you think you know
What is hip?
If you was really hip
The passing years would show
You into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
But what is hip?

So you became part of the new breed
Been smokin' only the best weed
Been hangin' out on the so-called hippest set
Being seen at all the right places
Being seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied
Still it ain't quite right

[Chorus]

Hipness, what it is!
Hipness, what it is!
Hipness, what it is!
And sometimes hipness is 
What it ain't!

You done even went and found you a guru
In your effort to find you a new you
And maybe even managed 
To raise your conscious level
As you striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
What's hip today
Might become passe",What Is Hip? [T.O.P.R.M.X.],2004

Meat Loaf,"I'm not afraid to show you who I am 
And I am not ashamed of my life 
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road 
I've always felt you deep in my bones 

With every step I rise and fall 
With everything to gain I end up losing it all 
When the darkness gets in 
I scream out and your light sets me free 

I'm not afraid of the past no more 
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good 
I used to dance to the devil's beat 
If I could bust into hell I would 

I'm not afraid to shed all my skin 
I'm not afraid of the faults you see 
I'm tearing down these walls right now 
They're comin' down 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

I'm not afraid when they kick me down 
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed 
I'm not afraid if I live or die 
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

And I wish that I could give you something in return 
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned 
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned 

And in the end you'll finally see 
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can 
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need 

I'm not afraid of the the truth no more 
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid 
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins 
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did 

I'm not afraid of the things you know 
I'm just a book for the world to read 
My final words on the final page 
Will be amends 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black 
The way me forgive me and just take me back 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black 
The way me forgive me and just take me back 
Your love is blind, blind as bat...",Blind as a Bat,
Meat Loaf,"Heaven can wait
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart
Will take me through the lonely night
Through the cold of the day
And I know
I know
Heaven can wait
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me
And the melody's gonna make me fly
Without pain
Without fear
Give me all of your dreams 
And let me go along on your way
Give me all of your prayers to sing
And i'll turn the night into the skylight of day
I got a taste of paradise
I'm never gonna let it slip away
I got a taste of paradise
It's all I really need to make me stay --
Just like a child again

Heaven can wait
And all I got is time until the end of time
I won't look back
I won't look back
Let the altars shine

And I know that I've been released 
But I don't know to where
And nobody's gonna tell me know 
And I don't really care
No no no
I got a taste of paradise
That's all i really need to make me stay
I got a taste of paradise
If I had it any sooner you know
You know I never would have run away from my home

Heaven can wait
And all I got is time until the end of time
I won't look backr
I won't look back
Let the altars shine

Meat Loaf,"Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone
Baby baby, baby baby

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I oh we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl - she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew
Baby baby, baby baby - chorus
You got the kind of legs that do more than walk

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink
You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely and my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point
You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone

Baby baby 

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I oh we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of

Meat Loaf,"You know God in all of his wisdom 
Made the pretty flowers that you see 
Tell me about it 
You know he made them all up different, girl 

Just like you and me 
Now listen to me 
Don't that tell you something boy? 
It's heavy, but that's how it's got to be 

What's good enough for God almighty 
It's good enough for you and me 
You know it takes all, all kinds of people 
The young, old, and the rich and the poor 

It takes all, all kinds of people 
Everybody's got to give a little bit more 
I don't care if you got no money 
'Cause money's just a means to an end 

But when you're cold and lonely, girl 
You're gonna cry, cry up old dreams 
But your love, with love, with love for each other boy 
We can get down to where we're feeling free 

Every man, woman and child 
I'll bet ya 
Will live in love and harmony 
Together, together 

You know it takes all, all kinds of people 
The young, old, and the rich and the poor

Meat Loaf,"There ain't no hidden treasure, in this pot of gold you see.
Ain't no way you're going to make, no silk purse outta me.

Well I'm never ever gonna change your ways, I'll take you as you are.
You got something that I want, and that's a way to start.

What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.

I told you that I loved you, right from the very start.
Now don't you make me start again, baby and open up my heart.

Well I know that I'm no angel, can say my first time out.
But you can count on what I've got, 'cause what I've got's enough.

What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.

When it's cold I want it hot, I've always wanted what it not.
But when it comes to loving you, I'm yours no matter what you do.

Oh, you're my baby, I'm your man, this is not an angel's plan.

Can't you see it, it's a fact, loving you is where it's at.

(What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.)

Meat Loaf,"Everything is permitted, everything is allowed
And all our gods we have outwitted
We are running with the crowd
And all the clocks are showing zero
And all our parents must have fled
And we just never had no heroes
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead
Everything is permitted, there is nothing out of bounds
There are no limits or no fences
There is always some way 'round
And all the compass points are zero
And all the navigators fled
And we just never had no heroes
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead

If everything is permitted, if nothing ever is taboo
Then there is always something shattered
When there is something breaking through

And all the clocks are showing zero
And all our parents must have fled
And we just never had no heroes
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead

Meat Loaf,"From the minute I turned and laid my eyes on you, I had no eyes of my own
I was blind to the world, you were too good to be true
But you were something to see, so very young and alone
And I still don't believe the way you turned on me
Now where's the girl that I knew?
I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love
You gave me nothing but trouble, man, I've been such a fool

You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you

How do you abuse me, let me count the ways
How many hours in how many days
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain
How many rules breaking how many games

[Chorus]
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways
How many hours in how many days
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain
How many rules breaking how many games

You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack
Go on and take all your stuff, don't even bother to pack
In every way I want you out of my life
But I'll kill you if you don't come back, I'll kill you if you don't come back

In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close
And then you'd hold me so tight
And in the wink of an eye you used to give me it all
And with a kiss in the darkness you'd deliver the light

And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud
I know you're laughing at me
Oh ain't it funny and sad the way I fell for your lies
The way I fell into love and then I begged to be free

You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you

[Chorus]

Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach
They're dreamin' of boys and staying just out of reach
Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track
They're glistening like diamonds with sweat on their backs

Bless all the girls in the gangs on the street
They're looking for danger and they're holding their piece
Bless all the girls staying late after school
They're playing with fire and oh they're playing it cool

And bless all the shy girls who're learning to dance
They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance
Bless all the girls who are always alone
They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone

Bless all the homecoming queens of the night
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights
And bless all the girls who know what love is about
They try not to cry and then they try to put out

And bless all the homecoming queens of the night
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights
And bless all the girls who know what love is about
They try not to cry and then they try to put out

Somebody bless all these girls that I never have met
But damn you and curse you after all that you've done
You're the one girl I'll never forget
You're the one girl I'll never forget

Somebody bless all these girls and everything that they do

Meat Loaf,"From the very first moment I saw you, I knew our love would be so strong
And the very first moment I kissed you, I knew our joy would last so long
And then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy

[Chorus:]

Won't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me, I won't throw you no curves
Have yourself a ball with my good woman
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve

When I saw you hanging round the truck stop, shining like an angel in the night
And when I saw you crying like a baby, I knew you'd have to be my wife

Then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy

Now I think I'm gonna have to leave you
Because I'm feeling much too weak to share
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces
The flavor that I crave is no longer there

Then I saw you making love to two of my best friends
I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said - listen here, group

Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve",More Than You Deserve,1981
Meat Loaf,"Every day of my life they say the same old thing
Hey boy! Oh boy, you better wait for your turn
And every day of my life I get the same old line
Hey boy! Oh boy, when are you going to learn
I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green
I want to go on all colors that I see in between
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs
I want to run all the way across a double white line

But every day of my life I see the same old road
Hey girl! Oh girl, we gotta pull up our routes
And every day of my life I see the same old dream
Hey girl! Oh girl, I need a dream I can use

I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green
I want to go on all colors that I see in between
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs

My body is the car and my soul is the ignition
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we

Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! We're sick and tired of waiting in line
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! Nobody's taking our time

Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!

Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime

And every night of my life there's something holding me back
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, I know it's time to cut loose
And every night of my life I dream of someone like you
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, you got a dream I can use

Meat Loaf,"I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes
Like a little girl I once knew
Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street
You walk with me, and I walk with you

Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense
Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?
You and I were like a light from a fallen star
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart

[Chorus]
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again
And I just can't hold on to your love anymore
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again
And it just can't be, like it was once before

Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel
You and I were like a light from a fallen star
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart

Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel
(No, I never could turn away from you)

[Chorus]",Don't You Look at Me Like That,1983
Meat Loaf,"I took one look and something snapped inside,
I said I love your eyes
You took my heart, you took my breath away,
I felt my temperature rise
You said you've never loved a man this way
That it was heaven you were here to stay

[Chorus]
And now you're just another fallen angel
And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm
And now you're just another fallen angel
Falling into somebody else's arms

I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise
I must admit that when I first laid eyes,
you had me hypnotized
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch

[Chorus]

Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me
To love and to comfort you
And what he got ain't enough to keep you in the air
I'll be there

That it was heaven you were here to stay

Meat Loaf,"You say you're all alone,
And after all the changes you've been through today
You can use a little tenderness, right now

OK, I've been alone,
And I can understand the way you feel tonight
Maybe together we can charge it all right now

I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes
You need somebody you can hold onto

If you really want to, I'd love to hold you
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto

You say, he broke your heart,
He left you crying, but he did not set you free
And now you feel like you can never love again

OK, so let me know,
It's up to you how long you let his memory stay
And do you really want to carry on this way

I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes
You need somebody you can hold onto

If you really want to, I'd love to hold you
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto

If you really want to, if you really want to,
Then I really can't deny you

So many things you need to know, so many left to say
But you mean more than words I know,
I can help you chase the pain away

I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes
You need somebody you can hold onto

If you really want to, if you really want to
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto

Meat Loaf,"Another New York waltz at four a.m.,
In the canyons lost at night
The city's just a jail for me, full of high rise prison walls
And I'm riding through this darkness,
'cause I know there's life within
And I'm searching through the shadows,
Just to find that light again

Keep driving (keep driving),
Let the meter run
Keep driving (keep driving),
Oh the night's not really done

Keep driving

And I'm hanging on a memory, and I feel it in the air
I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets,
But I know I'll find you there
And oh Lord, you look so pretty,
But you can see it in my eyes
And just before my tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside
It seems so real until the light turns green

Don't wake me up, don't ruin this dream, don't take me from my scene

Keep driving, keep driving,
Keep driving, keep driving,
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone

They don't tell you when the music stops,
Or how the movie ends
Is it too late once the feeling's gone,
To back it up and start it all again?

Oh Lord you look so pretty,
And you can see it in my eyes
And just before that tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside

Priscilla, Priscilla, nearly sixteen but they treat you like a kid
Priscilla, Priscilla, they're gonna kill ya for what you did

Cuttin' class with a backstage pass, and always skippin' lunch
Ya put your hand on the knees of the boys, and daddy's vodka in the punch
Learned how to jump start your grandma's car, how to French inhale your Kools
And now you know that breakin' hearts is easy as breakin' the rules

[Chorus]

You don't remember no revolution, you don't belong to no baby boom

Just you and your headphones, dreamin' in your pink bedroom

Strong girls break the records, and rich girls break their nails

Smart girls always know by heart, what some girls always fail

Bad little girls grow up to be good, and good girls finish last

But crazy girls don't care how they grow up, as long as they grow up fast

[Chorus]",Priscilla,1983
Meat Loaf,"I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind
I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh, and on across Caroline
I had motor trouble that turned into a struggle, halfway across Alabama
And that 'Hound broke down and left me all stranded in Downtown Birmingham

Right away I bought me a through train ticket, ridin' across Mississippi clean
And I was on the Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham, smokin' into New Orleans

Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let a poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit, they put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land

Workin' on a T-bone steak, I had a party flyin' over to the Golden State
When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes
He would get us at the Terminal zone

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater 41009
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater 41009
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line

And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
And their big boy's on the line",The Promised Land,1983
Meat Loaf,"Two a.m. with the lost and the lonely
Walkin' past the kids, comin' back from the party
Smiles on their faces, you remember so well how it was
Nights in the back of that Buick that you got runnin'
Your baby by your side, told the whole world you're comin'


[Chorus]
Work so hard to do what is right
Believed in what you're doin',
But so many fights
Trusted too many, believed too much,
Workin' your life to the bone

There's a wolf at your door,
He wants your money, wants your soul
A wolf at your door, you give it all, he wants more
There's a wolf at your door,
He says he's playin' for keeps
Breathin' down your neck, boy
It's sure hard to sleep

With a wolf at your door

They'll take it away, when you're not lookin'
Look you in the eyes, tell you how good they're doin'
Smiles on their faces, are lies to keep you from knowin'
You're not guilty, you are the victim,
But you still pay for the crime
Don't look for trouble, it'll always find you in time

Work so hard to do what is right
Believed in what you're doin',
But so many fights
Trusted too many, relieved too much,
Workin' your life to the bone

There's a wolf at your door,
He says he's playin' for keeps
Breathin' down your neck, boy
It's sure hard to sleep

With a wolf at your door

It won't be broken, I'll fight 'til I drop,
Blood burnin' hot in my veins

But they won't be satisfied until they take everything

And if they say yes 
Does it mean it's really so?

You're ready for the thrill tonight
You think you'll take it slow
But she's forgotten more, boy
Then you will ever know

She calls you up in the middle of the night
She says she's lonesome and alone
You're all revved up, finally some place to go
You knock on that door

And I'll be closer to you now than any other boy

When the screws are tightenin', and the tears are falling
I can hear her crying out to be saved

Meat Loaf,"Well I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon Hold on tight
C'mon Hold on tight
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Well ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Baby don't you hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
Well I gotta let you know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I want to make your motor run
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night

Okay, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here,
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth,
There's the windup, and there it is,
A line shot up the middle, look at him go.
This boy can really fly
He's rounding first and really turning it on now,
He's not letting up at all,
He's gonna try for second, the ball is bobbled out in center,
And here comes the throw, and what a throw
He's gonna slide in head first,
Here he comes, he's out
No, wait, safe-safe at second base,
This kid really makes things happen out there.
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going,
And what a jump he's got, he's trying for third,
Here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at third
Holy cow, stolen base, he's taking a pretty big lead out there,
Almost daring him to try and pick him off.
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted,
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw, here's the play at the
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it

Stop right there

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore, that I would love you to the end of time
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my life with you

For whatever the cost

Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
Will he offer me his mouth?

Yes

Will he offer me his teeth?

Yes

Will he offer me his jaws?

Yes

Will he offer me his hunger?

Yes

Again, will he offer me his hunger?

Yes!

And will he starve without me?

Yes!

And does he love me?

Yes

Yes

On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

Yes

I bet you to say that to all the boys.

It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
And when I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars, falling through your trembling hands

While you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
And I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh we were lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon you know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

Oh will you hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want
Oh the night is young and ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.

Way down in the valley tonight.

And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising

He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,

Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone.
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done
and the sun goes down
and the moonlight's shining through.
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light.

And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothings ever worth the cost.

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night with you

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]

Well I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell.

Meat Loaf,"I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Thought it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed


Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Baby don't ya hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I wanna make your motor run
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night

OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here,
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth,
There's the windup, and there it is, a line shot up the middle,
Look at him go. This boy can really fly! He's rounding first and really
Turning it on now, he's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for
Second; the ball is bobbled out in center, and here comes the
Throw, and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head first, here he
Comes, he's out! No, wait, safe-safe at second base, this kid
Really makes things happen out there. Batter steps up to the
Plate, here's the pitch-he's going, and what a jump he's got,
He's trying for third, here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at
Third! Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out
There, almost daring him to try and pick him off. The pitcher
Glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, bunted down the third
Base line, the suicide squeeze is on! Here he comes, squeeze
Play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw,
Here's the play at the plate holy cow,
I think he's gonna make it!

Stop right there!
I gotta know right now!
Before we go any further!
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?
Do you love me!?
Will you love me forever!?
Do you need me!?
Will you never leave me!?
Will you make me happy for the rest of my life!?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife!?
I gotta know right now

Do you love me!?

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time,
So I can end my time with you!!

It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better than it is today

It never felt so good it never felt so right

And maybe you can cry all night
But that will never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long

She never loved me back, ooh I know

She kissed me and got out of our bed

Not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world

But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through.
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,

But I never knew how far down
I was falling
Before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre 
Could be burning 
On the edge of the ice field

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand

And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart

""Oh Babe, don't go""
And don't you hear me screaming:

In the chains of my master

I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that

Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you ev'ry night of my life, no way
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Will you build and emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Oh, I would do anything for love

I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone
Baby baby

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love

Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl, she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew

Baby baby, baby baby

I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

You got the kind of legs that do more than walk

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk

Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see

You got a lotta nerve to come on to me

You got the kind of lips that do more than drink

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone

They say that I'm in need of some radical discipline
They say I gotta face the truth
That I'm just another case of arrested development
I'm just another wasted youth

They say I'm wild and I'm reckless
I should be acting my age
I'm an impressionable child In a tumultuous world
And they say I'm at a difficult stage

But it seems to me to the contrary
Of all the crap they're gonna put on the page
That a wasted youth is better by far
Then a wise and productive old age
A wasted youth is better by far

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright.

There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone.
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done
and the sun goes down
and the moonlight's shining through.
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light.

Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you.

If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned

Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night with you

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]

Well I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape.

But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell.

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,

Breaking out of my body, and flying away

Meat Loaf,"You can't run away forever, 
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start 
You want to shut out the night 
You want to shut down the sun 
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart 

Think of how we'd lay down together 
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong 
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods 
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs 

I treasure your love 
I never want to lose it 
You've been through the fires of hell 
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it 

I treasure your love 
I want to show you how to use it 
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
And I know you've got the scars to prove it 

Remember everything that I told you 
And I'm telling you again that it's true 
When you're alone and afraid 
And you're completely amazed 
To find there's nothing anybody can do 

Keep on believing 
And you'll discover baby 

There's always something magic 
There's always something new 
And when you really, really need it the most 
That's when rock and roll dreams come through 

The beat is yours forever 
The beat is always true 
And when you really need it the most 
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you

Once upon a time was a backbeat 
Once upon a time all the chords came to life 
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings

You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
And I know you've got the scars to prove it 

Remember everything that I told you

And let the drummer tell your heart what to do

Meat Loaf,"The skys were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend, Kenny
We were close as any brothers that you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They say he crashed and burned, I swear I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young

We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
They are

And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and druk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
No where to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank as he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone
So many threats and fears, so many wasted years
Before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly, coarse, and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind, and then he pulls me back

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are

There was a beauty living on the edge of town
She always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stare would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said
Caution, kids at play

Those were the rites of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage
She use my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared
But I can see rising up out of the back seat now
Just like an angel rising out of a tomb

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far

Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right

Meat Loaf,"Under your protective wing I walked into the night
And a thousand angry demons up and took flight
And I went running through the fields with the fever in my veins
And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name
Above my head, all in red, I could see you bearing down on me
You said you're not running out, no you're leaving now
I will find you, there is no way out
I'll keep tracking you down in the still of this night
Forever, mine forever

[Chorus]
Don't leave your mark on me, I have to reply
I'm not staying, no, and I'm not just killing time
Don't leave your mark on me, I have to reply, I'm not staying, no
I'm not staying, no

Mistress of the darkness, accomplice of the night
A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside
And something led the way though I could not see its face
And a voice from deep inside me screamed to get out of this place
Above my head, all was said as the jailor turned the key on me
He said you're not running out, no you're not leaving now
There ain't no way, there is no no way

[Chorus]

This nightmare never ends, memories of absent friends
Masked illusions stare at me, point the finger silently
Stand accused as the jury scares, there's a ghost in here somewhere
There's a ghost in here somewhere

I'm not staying, no
Oh this nightmare really never ends, this is memories of absent friends

Meat Loaf,"And the band began to play, without a song they'd lose their way
A song of love and custom dreams, a song of yesterday
When they danced, when they danced, her skirts were lifted high
She felt the music in his arms, the danger in his eyes
And a woman said no, and a man said ""but I love you so""
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""Take my love into your heart
I must have you here by my side""

It happened all too fast, they came to love and they came to last
No-one remembers now who lied, true love is made of glass
And a woman said ""change"", and a man said ""as soon as I can""
And a woman said ""open up"", and a man said
""Your way's right, you're my love, I won't be holdin' you down""

In the evening of their lives, no regrets and clear blue skies
They meet again in old New York, he tells her one sweet lie

And they danced and they danced, and a man said ""I love you so""
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""take my love into your heart
I must have you here by my side""",Man and a Woman,1994
Meat Loaf,"It's getting cold, it's getting dark, the nights are longer every day
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away
And we've been waitin' here so long that we've forgotten what it's like
To turn into the fire, lookin' straight into the, straight into the light

Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back
We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away, breakin' away
Breakin' away, we're breakin' away from the pack
We're breakin' away from the pack

And if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And your speed is all you'll ever need, all you'll ever need to know

[Chorus]
You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly and we gotta get away from the past
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast
Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly
They're only fighting for the chance to be last
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast

It's so much better goin' nowhere fast

You shouldn't always see your world so clearly
You shouldn't always know your place so well
And all we're doin' here is hangin' around
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here is gonna be hell
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here has gotta be hell

I'm getting lost, I'm getting found, I'm getting born again each day
We're dyin' on the vine until we finally, 'til we finally get away
The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose
The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some, put it to some use

Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

[Chorus]",Nowhere Fast,1994
Meat Loaf,"At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming
And the cars and the beast behind, they all start humming
And ooh you got a cool machine, so let's get it runnin'
We'll break the silence of the night and you know they're gonna hear us comin'

We always see them whisper, we know they're gonna talk
They fantasize the mysteries 'bout the night and the dark

So baby one more kiss, baby one more kiss, we never have to say goodbye
Oh one more kiss, baby one more kiss, it brings a little luck to the night

Artists got their easels, they're ready on the mark
Gonna try and take the pictures of the dust and the gold in the sparks
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'
You never looked so good before and you know your time it's finally comin'

'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'
Our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'
Champions of the night, when the engines are rumblin'

So just one more kiss, baby one more kiss, we never have to say goodbye
One more kiss, baby one more kiss, I never want to see you cry
One more kiss, baby one more kiss, it brings a little luck to the night
One more kiss, baby one more kiss, we never have to say goodbye

(Ready, ready to roll, ready, ready to roll, ready, ready to roll, ready)

Under my foot gonna hit it down, take this stance before the crowd
Sleepin' city urban fall, summer's sadness time to answer the call

(Cool machine, get it runnin', ready to roll)

Soft hands around my neck, one more kiss then it's time to connect
Leave this child, leave me all alone, this one's mine and I'm takin' it home

(Ready, ready, ready to roll)

This one's mine and I'm takin' it home

Now behind closed walls new histories start to rise
Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie
And ooh you got a cool machine, baby let's get it runnin'
You never looked so good before and you know your time it's finally comin'

'Cause our home is the wind, you know we're gods of the mornin'

Meat Loaf,"I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll, when it didn't cost a thing
Stacks of scratched up 45's and taught myself how to sing
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, burnin' it up in a smoke filled club
Givin' your soul to the world

Like a rock 'n' roll hero, when the white hot lights cut through the night

And you're feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero

I swear I'll bring it down for you

Baby baby, baby baby 

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do 
Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby 
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

You got the kind of legs that do more than walk
I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink
You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone

Baby baby, baby baby 

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I we got better things to do

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again

And don't you hear me screaming

And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

You know I love you
For crying out loud

Meat Loaf,"The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend Kenny
We were close as any brothers than you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream and so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They said he crashed and burned
I know I'll never learn why any boy should die so young

We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now and he's gaining ground

[Chorus]
But it was long ago and it was far away, oh God it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank as he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone So
Many threats and fears, so many wasted years before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind and then he pulls me back

[Chorus]

There was a beauty living on the edge of town
And she always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said, Caution! Kids At Play!

Those were the rights of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage, she used my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared But I can see her rising up
Out of the back seat now Just like an angel rising up from a tomb

Racing like a runaway horse
The subways are sizzling
And the skin of the streets is gleaming with sweat
I've seen you sitting on the steps outside
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost
I think it's time for you to come inside
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget
I think it's time for you to come inside

Wasted Youth
I remember everything!
I remember everything little thing, as if it happened yesterday
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender Guitar
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome, and a voice like a horny angel
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy

It required the perfect combination of the right power chords
And the precise angel from which to strike!

The guitar bled for about a week afterwords
And the blood was zoot, dark and rich, like wild berry's
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords
But it rung out beautifully
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before

So I took my guitar
And I smashed it against the wall
I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson
The Harley howled in pain
The guitar howled in heat

And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight
Slowly I opened the door
Creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed
I raised the guitar high above my head
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of the bed
My father woke up, screaming ""Stop!""
""Wait a minute. Stop it boy. What do you think your doing?""
""That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument""
And I said, ""God Damn It daddy,""

When love was forever.

After loves curtain comes down.
Listen and you'll hear the sound.
Hear the sound of a heart breaking.
Not a smile left on my face.
The ending's just too sad to take.
And there's not a dry eye.
Not a dry eye in the house.
The greatest story was you and me.
Had it all we had everything, but now the.
Story's done it's just history.
The last act is over.
You every line had the sweetest sound.
Your every touch turned my world around.
But the light came up and my world crashed down.
End of show
It's over.
It was almost like a movie.
Those nights we touched the stars.
Time stood still for you and I.
Now it's sad enough to make you cry.
Now there's not a dry eye in the house.
After loves curtain comes down.
Listen and you'll hear the sound.

Not a smile left on my face.
The ending's just too sad to take.
And there's not a dry eye.

Act one
The story's just begun.
Act two
I fell in love with you.
Act three
Knew it was meant to be.
Act four
You don't love me no more.
And there's not a dry eye in the house.
After loves curtain comes down.

Meat Loaf,"You see me now as large as life, but underneath you knew all too well
The hollow shell, no spark of life
Where once upon a time there beat a heart
For you and you knew it from the start, and you went and blew it all away
And you knew how, oh you knew best
The strings to pull and buttons to press
To wind me up and make me shake, you controlling every move I made
I couldn't see through it, all the pain, and you put me through it
Over and over again, just tell me over and over and over

[Chorus]
How could you say there was no other, why is it nothing's what it seems
You told me I'm your greatest lover, do you even know what that word means
Your lovin' is coolin', baby who ya think you're foolin'
'cause when I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams

When I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams

Stop it! Stop it! Don't you say a word
I feel my hands around her neck and everything went blurred
Broken, broken, she slipped from out my hands
She lay so still and lifeless, I cried baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]

(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)

(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)

It was my dumb luck, I just came unstuck

Meat Loaf,"Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine
Let me tell you fortune life that once was mine

She was a special girl and she meant the world to me and I gave her everything

When I found her, I'd been looking everywhere
And when I lost her, I was lost beyond despair

Dreams are hard to touch, could it be I love her too much

Bottom line is she was fine in every way
And it's not with hesitation that I say

Meat Loaf,"Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't gettin us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you, I need you
But-there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom
Of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got
There's only one girl I'll ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Oh I know

I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you, I need you

But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole
And everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart
You know I want to be damned with you
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned

Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you

Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you

Well I can see myself tearing up the road, faster
Than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell

Looking for something new
And you were nothing but a lonely girl
But you were something

I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
When I played my guitar
I made the canyons rock, but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

In the middle of a steaming night
I'm tossing in my sleep
And in the middle of a red-eyed dream
I see you coming
Coming on to give it to me

I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal
I'm a leader of the pack, but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

I've been stalking you and tracking you down
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long
We could be standing at the top of the world
Instead of sinking further down in the mud
You and me 'round about midnight
You and me 'round about midnight
Someone's got to draw first

Draw first
Someone's got to draw first blood
Someone's got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood

Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying:
""Oh Babe, don't go""
And don't you hear me screaming:
""How was I to know?""

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

[Chorus]
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you

I was damned and you were saved
And I never knew how enslaved 
I was kneeling
In the chains of my master

I could laugh but you could cry
And I never knew just how high 
I was flying
Ah, with you right above me

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

[Chorus]

For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry
For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why
And my oh my 
For that I thank you

For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
And don't you know 
For that I need you

For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and driving me home
And you gotta know 
For that I serve you

For pulling me away when I'm starting to fall
For revving me up when I'm starting to stall
And all in all 
For that I want you

For taking and for giving and for playing the game
For praying for my future in the days that remain
Oh Lord 
For that I hold you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

You know I love you",For Crying out Loud [DVD],2000
Meat Loaf,"You can't run away forever, 
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night
You want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid
And you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do
Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby

There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through....for you...

Once upon a time was a backbeat
Once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure you love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
You're never alone cause you can put on the phones
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do
Keep on believing 
And you'll discover baby

There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming and the fires are howling,
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye,
And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky,
And A killer's on the bloodshot streets.
Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising,
Oh I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter,
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.
When it's over you know,
We'll both be so alone.

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone gone gone.
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done and the sun goes down,
And the moonlights shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram,
On a silver black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry,
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole.
Everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks
And nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

And I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I'd rather be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned,
Dancing through the night with you.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned.
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned,
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night with you.

Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.

I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done and the sun goes down,
And the moonlights shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

Oh I can see myself tearing up the road,
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe.
No-one's gonna stop me now,
I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve 'till it's way too late.

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart,
Still beating,
Breaking out of my body,
And flying away,
Like a bat out of hell.
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.

Breaking out of my body and flying away,

You're ready for the thrill tonight, you think you'll take it slow
But she's forgotten more, boy, than you will ever know

Meat Loaf,"I'm so afraid to draw you close
Hold me
Before my hands fall away
I'll suffocate
If I can't breathe you in
And hold you there
Forever

I left a message at the hotel
They said you checked out
They said you ain't coming back
I tried to call you
But you turned off your cell
And it said at the tone
Just leave me alone

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all my strength was gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel

I built this prison that I thought was a home
And we both lived here
Guess you were living alone
I'd tear it down if you would only have asked
And I would build you a bridge
So you could come back

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all your fears were gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
Hey, now tell me why can't you just break my heart?
I used to be an man of steel
And I used to take you in my arms
I loved you from the start
Now you can't tear my world apart

I used to be a man of steel
Now every bit of faith is gone
You used to be so strong
Now you can't even break my heart
I used to be a man of steel
I used to take you in my arms

Meat Loaf,"Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't gettin us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you, I need you
But-there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never drill for oil on a city street

Of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got
There's only one girl I'll ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Oh I know

I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you, I need you

But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you

Flying free as a bird caught inside every word you say
I want everyone to see

This is big time
This is larger than life
See the sparks fly
When you're standing by my side
Every step, every move, everything I do
Life is beautiful because of you

Every breath that you give
You're my sweet oxygen my friend
You made me follow it fast so my dreams could get past the end

When you're standing by my side

Meat Loaf,"And you said nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

Little lady, I think there's something on your mind
I've known you long enough to know
The words are not that hard to find

And the harder you try and the longer you go
Well there's nothing but love in those eyes any more
You know what to say but you never know how
You can keep your mouth shut because it doesn't really matter right now

I will guide you all the way
Because I know exactly what you're trying to say

You have the right to remain silent
I'll get the lights, you get that smile

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

I see the angels, they're standing right outside your door
They're watching over me, they're watching over us all
You can send them home tonight, because you won't need them anymore
In your arms I think I've found the safest place to fall
When I step in the door and I stare at your face
There are so many things that I wish I could say
Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight
You can keep your mouth shut, because it doesn't really matter tonight

I will guide you all the way
Because I know exactly what you're trying to say
You have the right to remain silent
I'll get the lights
You get that smile

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

And I know you feel the same
You've been searching for the words,
Now you know what to say

Just say nothing
Don't say a word
Silence is gold
Don't say a word

This is the moment we've been waiting for
If I exercise my right
I will take your body language and hold it against you tonight

And I know you feel the same
I've wondered all my life, if this moment comes would I know what to say
Then you say nothing at all
So many times I stumbled on the words I wanted to say
Then you say nothing at all
So many thoughts, that I should have just let my heart explain
Then you say nothing at all
So many ways we could turn the words around
Then you say nothing at all
So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground
Then you say nothing at all
So many dreams that are finally coming true
Well, I couldn't have said it better myself
Now you finish me off when you finish my thoughts the way you do

You say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else",Couldn't Have Said It Better,2003
Meat Loaf,"So this is what it feels like 
To be the one left behind 
To give it all you've got, then find
You've already changed your mind

And this is what it sounds like 
Crying on the bed that we both made
Waiting for a sign that you just can't give me 
Any kind of sign

I don't want to be here wide-awake
Clinging to a love that can't be saved
Hanging off the edge of every word 
That you say 

So I asked myself, ""Do I love you so much
That I'm willing to let you go?""
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""
But, at the bottom of my heat I'm wondering

Did I say that?
Did I say that?
Sometimes you know I over react
And what I say is not a matter of fact
I wish that I could take it all back 

And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side 
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide
And I need some sympathy here
And I need someone to call my own 
I'm standing in the light of my mistakes 
And begging you, ""come home.""

And I know you need some time to run and hide
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride

But I said that

And I wish I could take it all back 

And I need some sympathy here 
And I want a love to call my own 
I want to take you in the back seat now 
And slowly drive you home 

And I know you need some time to run and hide 
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're 
Choking on your pride 
I don't want to be this wide-awake

Fighting for a love that I can't save
And hanging off the edge of every word you say 
Knowing that it might make me cry 
I don't want to be this complicating
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting 
I stumbled on ""I love you"" tonight 
But it sounded like goodbye 

Did I say that?
Did I say that?
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if
Would have been a matter of fact

Did I say that?
This time I'm not letting go
Did I say that?
This time I'll have and I'll hold 
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it
Would have been a matter of fact
Did I say that?
This time I'm walking through fire 
Did I say that?
This time I'll feed your desire
Did I say that?
This time I'll stand by your side 
Did I say that?
This time I will be your pride

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all my strength was gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel

I built this prison that I thought was a home
And we both lived here
Guess you were living alone
I'd tear it down if you would only have asked
And I would build you a bridge
So you could come back

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all your fears were gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel

I used to be a man of steel
I used to take you in my arms
Hey, now tell me
Why can't you just break my heart?

I used to be a man of steel
I used to take you in my arms
I loved you from the start
Now you can't tear my world apart

I used to be a man of steel
Now every bit of faith is gone
You used to be so strong
Now you can't even break my heart

I used to be a man of steel
I used to take you in my arms
What's it going to take for us
To break down and finally fall?

Apart at the seams
It seems that I always will fall apart
As strong as you are, as strong as I am
Why can't you break my heart?

Meat Loaf,"Listen
I was born on the other side
Just always looking to you
I made it over the great divide
Now I'm coming for you

Your forces lined up in battle
Your soldiers and your machines
The sun been blacked out by shadows
The darkest hour now you've ever seen

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

I rose up on the doctor's slab
Like Lazarus from the pit
And everyone wants to take a stab
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit

I've been held up on money
I've been beaten out of spite
You want a piece of me honey?
Lose or win

You know you've been in a fight
And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and
Tear him down.

Now there ain't much difference
Between a bridge and a wall
Without me right in the middle baby
You'll be nothing at all

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

Meat Loaf,"Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny
I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker site
Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road
But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night
Oh, I testify

I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie
And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight
Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before
And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night
Oh, I testify

On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night
Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow
And a sweet young thing called out my name
And this is how it goes, she says...
""Go boy, can you hear them?
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?""
And I got down on my knees

I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down
Up from the ground and I testify

Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide
All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore
You've got to walk before you run
See the night before dawn
Before you pull yourself off the floor

As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Thought it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

Cause we were barely dressed
And we were barely dressed
Baby doncha hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I want to make your motor run

We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night

OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here, 
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth, 
There's the windup, and there it is, 
A line shot up the middle, look at him go. 
This boy can really fly! 
He's rounding first and really turning it on now, 
He's not letting up at all, 
He's gonna try for second, the ball is bobbled out in center, 
And here comes the throw, and what a throw! 
He's gonna slide in head first, 
Here he comes, he's out! 
No, wait, safe-safe at second base, 
This kid really makes things happen out there. 
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going, 
And what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, 
Here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at third! 
Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out there, 
Almost daring him to try and pick him off. 
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, 
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on! 
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, 
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Stop right there!
I gotta know right now!
Before we go any further!

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my life with you!!

I burn it up and burn it out

There's always something going wrong

That's what this is all about

And all the stooges with their coins 
They're the ones who make the rules 
It's not a game it's just a rout 


There's desparation (there's desperation)
There's desparation in the air 
It leaves a stain on all your clothes 
And no detergent gets it out 

And we're always slipping through the cracks (slipping)
Then the movie's over fade to black 
Life is a lemon and I want my money...

For the good of those chills up your spine
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart
For the good of what's yours and what's mine
For the good of believing in a life after birth
For the good of your body so bright
For the good of the search for some heaven on earth

I don't want to feel this
Nothing can stop this pain
Trying to get to a time I forget you
Still tangled in yesterday

It's so easy for you
To give nothing for me
Did you ever feel anything?

I want you to cry over me
Die over me
Even for a moment
Even for a moment

I want you to hurt over me
Feel what I feel
I want you to cry over, die over me
Baby, just for one time

I want your heart broken
Some sign of emotion
Wanna to see the tears tumble down

Show me I meant something
And that you feel nothing
But your world crashing to the ground

To forget about me
Did I ever mean anything?

Did we mean nothing at all?

Die over me

I want you to hurt over me
Feel what I feel
Even for a moment
Oh, why can't you just cry over, die over me

Baby, why can't you hurt like I do
Like I hurt over you
Can't you cry over, die over me

Baby, want you to fall on your knees
Baby, crawl back to me
Want you to cry over, die over me

Could follow me so mercilessly
It's almost surreal
All the pain that I feel

It doesn't matter what they're thinking
It doesn't matter what they're thinking of me
It's always so cold
I'm to young to be old
The future ain't what it used to be

Were there ever any stars in the sky
Did the sun ever shine so bright?
Do you have any dreams I could borrow
Just to get me through the lonely night?
Is there anything left to hold on to
When the rivers wash it all away?
Is there anyone left to hold on to
Is there anything left I can say?

Say a prayer for the falling angels
Stem the tide of the rising waters
Toll a bell for the broken hearted
Burn a torch for your sons and daughters

Dark days are pulling me forward
And all the tears are washing over me
I'm crying, lost forever
In a future that ain't what it used to be
No more no more no more

It's like a storm that's never ending
It's like a shadow on the land and the sea
There's nothing so sad as
A tomorrow gone bad
The future ain't what it used to be

Some days I feel so numb and empty
And those would be the good days for me
Nothing gets to me now
Unless I'm thinking of how

If God could talk, would He tell you it's alright, just leave
And don't look back at all the memories
The best of times, the mess you made of me
Walk on, if you think it's gonna make you strong

Why don't you run away and find yourself alive?
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart?

If God could talk, would He part the oceans straight to you
Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through
Another day, another night alone
Step right out into the great unknown tonight
Even God knows, baby, that ain't right

Why don't you run away and find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart? If God could talk

Did you swear to yourself on the day it was over
That you'd never turn around and get locked up in another cage?
Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?

Why don't you run away and find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart?

Holding my breath just to breathe
I tasted the sting of my tears

I was waking up stuck in a dream
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed
Wasted away by my fears

Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising,
Oh I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter,
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.
When it's over you know,
We'll both be so alone.

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone gone gone.
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done and the sun goes down,
And the moonlights shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram,
On a silver black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry,
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole.
Everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks
And nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

And I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I'd rather be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned,
Dancing through the night with you.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned.
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned,
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night with you.

Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.

I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done and the sun goes down,
And the moonlights shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

Oh I can see myself tearing up the road,
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe.
No-one's gonna stop me now,
I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve 'till it's way too late.

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart,
Still beating,
Breaking out of my body,
And flying away,
Like a bat out of hell.
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.

And the last thing I see is my heart.

Breaking out of my body and flying away,

Oh like a bat out of hell!

Trouble out my window and I'm gonna find it

Bouncin' to the boogie, hittin' with the beat
Wrapped in rhythm, dancin' till we drop

Rip off the headphones, shove my arm into the socket

Your love is so fine, it's got me feelin' alright
Going out of my mind, I got to have you tonight

It was a hot summer night
and the beach was burning.
There was fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
through your trembling hands.

You were licking your lips
and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
by the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to.
The night is young
And Ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.

and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining

And I wonder why you wanna go on sleeping
When there's nothing left to dream about

I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed
If it's something I want then it's something I need

But I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good

And I've been watching them glow
Take a chance on a promise and a roll of the dice
Put your foot on the gas, let it go, let it go, let it go

Bad for good
Bad for good

For the good of some thrills on a long frigid night
For the good of the fire in your soul
For the good of the kiss let me hold you so tight
For the good of getting out of control
For the good of the action and a race in the dark
For the good of those chills up your spine
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart
For the good of what's yours and what's mine
For the good of believing in a life after birth
For the good of your body so bright
For the good of the search for some heaven on earth
For the good of one hell of a night
For the good of one hell of a night

For the good of the action and a race in the dark
For the good of the fire in your soul
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart

The sky is whipping the sea
You can hide away forever from the storm
But you'll never hide away from me
The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark
And we may lose everything in the wind
But the Northern Lights are burning
And they're giving off sparks
I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin

I know that you can be bad
At least a little while
But if you give me a chance, give me one little chance
And give me all the love that you should
Then instead of being bad for just a little while
Then instead of being bad for just a little while
Then instead of being bad for just a little while

And I am not ashamed of my life 
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road 
I've always felt you deep in my bones 

With every step I rise and fall 
With everything to gain I end up losing it all 
When the darkness gets in 
I scream out and your light sets me free 

I'm not afraid of the past no more 
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good 
I used to dance to the devil's beat 
If I could bust into hell I would 

I'm not afraid to shed all my skin 
I'm not afraid of the faults you see 
I'm tearing down these walls right now 
They're comin' down 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat

And I wish that I could give you something in return 
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned 
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned 

And in the end you'll finally see 
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can 
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need 

I'm not afraid of the the truth no more 
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid 
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins 
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did 

I'm not afraid of the things you know 
I'm just a book for the world to read 
My final words on the final page 
Will be amends 'cause I believe

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothing's ever worth the cost

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,

Well I can see myself tearing up the road, faster
Than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late

Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,

Breaking out of my body and flying away

I find I spend my time
Waiting on your call
How can I tell you, babe

I need you by my side
To tell me it's alright

In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our lives, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Where the clear winds blow

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Meat Loaf,"And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'd never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now,
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that

Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long

No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Will you build and emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that

It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

Baby baby, baby baby 

[Chorus]

You got the kind of legs that do more than walk

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk

Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see

You got a lotta nerve to come on to me

You got the kind of lips that do more than drink

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone

No matter how I try
I'll never be able
To give you something
Something that I just haven't got

There's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Ooh I know
I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

But that ain't getting us nowhere",2 Out of 3 Ain't Bad [Live][*],2010

So much that the earth moved
Did you ever love somebody
Even though it hurt to

Nothin' else your heart could do
Did you ever love somebody

Did you ever lay your head down
On the shoulder of a good friend
And then had to look away somehow
Had to hide the way you felt for them
Have you ever prayed the day would come
You'd hear them say they'd feel it too
Have you ever loved somebody

I had to travel light
I climbed out my bedroom window
It was just about quarter past midnight

Out on the highway
I hitched a ride I was heading west
I had to listen to some trucker
Tell me all about the meaning of life

Got a ride just outside of Memphis
I was wild out on the road
I saw shanties' and shacks
And burnt out Cadillac's
And faces that flittered like fawn

Should have seen it coming
Oh I should have seen the signs
I saw seven horses running
I had a front row seat at the end of time

I was just fifteen
And the world was mine
And I watched my dreams
Come to life on that night
I saw Elvis in Vegas
I saw Elvis in Vegas

Now since that long lost summer
I ain't ever looked back
Now the lines on my face
Are looking more like cracks

When things all crumble
Its time to face the facts
I don't care about tomorrow
Oh there's no looking back

I should have seen it coming
Oh I should have seen the signs
I saw seven horses running
I had a front row seat at the end of time

I was just fifteen
And the world was mine
And I watched my dreams
Come to life on that night
I was standing tall
Felt I would never die
And I watched it all
In the white spot light

When the lights went out
I heard a young girl scream
The sound of my heart beat
The make up on her brow

I was just fifteen
And the world was mine
And I watched my dreams
Come to life on that night
I was standing tall
Felt I would never die

Too obvious
It's more like a calling, a vocation
Something I was

Put on this earth to do
Now I'm shooting with the stars

And my heartbeat is a symphony the

Closer I get to you

Came and here you are

You scraped off the ground

I'd have to go back bein'
That broken soul you found
Those days are in the darkness
I buried them with hardness

And I'd have to dig those
Demons out

Me in my place

Why did it take you so long to
Finally see
That we had love
That you don't find easily

You broke my heart and the price
To pay for that
Is you'll have to live the misery of
Losing what you had

If I can't have you
My words have come to late
I've already turned that page
Don't you look at me back and

That's the part I hate
I'll stay trapped inside my hell
Where it's so hot
That my walls melt

And I can hear a promise
In every lie you said
You'd never tell
If I had only told the truth

Oh I could never trust you to
You'll survive
No I will die
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I'm sorry for the things I
Cost you in the end
My punishment is more than any

I need you in my life
I can't let go
Why don't you stay with me

I feel alone

I put my pants on
I drive a shit car
Up into the valley

She's got a big couch
She's got a Mercedes Benz

Sing hallelujah
My glass is half full
She pours me champagne
She drinks a Red Bull
And she says 'darling
One thing thing you got to understand
As long as I am satisfied
Well, you will always be my man

You know that I, I'll give you all the love that have

Of love in truth
The skeptic in me longs for
To see of love some proof

Only for you do I care

It's just a dream

The song of madness madly crying to her

You're a wolf in a lamb's disguise
A cold lover with a warm invite
Morning gonna carry us to our grave
Dream a dream in agony
Sweetest dream you'll ever see
Make my dream reality oh carry me
Carry me to my grave

She placed the blade within the king's throne and in mine did I place my own
With the lamb's blood we purchased our sin's pardon
The sky ripped open and the shadows bled the moon blew out and the stars burned red
The song of madness madly crying to her

On a night such as this
An angel's lips and the devil's kiss
Morning gonna carry me to my grave
Dream a dream in agony
The sweetest dream you'll ever see
Make my dream reality
Carry me
Carry me to my grave
Oh carry me

The song of madness madly crying to her

Poised and ready to explode

To light that fuse

Crept now through my veins and through my head

You might as well get to know the rest of me

Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

BOY: I bet you say that to all the boys

It was a hot summer night
And the beach was burning.
Fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
Through your trembling hands.
You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
My soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
Just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
It must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you. (love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you. (love you)

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to.
The night is young
And ain't no one gonna know where you
No one gonna know where you
No one's gonna know where you've been.

You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining.

Meat Loaf,"Whatever happened to Saturday night?
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine

I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
We climbed in the back seat, really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul
Really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine

Get back in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song
With your arms around your girl, you try to sing along
It felt pretty good, woo
Really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul
Really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

Meat Loaf,"When the sky is falling and you're looking 'round for somewhere to hide
Did you ever call out to someone?
Did you ever call out to me?
I've never been gone
I've been right here by your side
There ain't nothin' but clouds
There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes

Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth?
You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth
Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most?
You're so busy trying to get even
You never even try to get close

I can't explain it away
Doesn't make any sense
To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
Guess you gotta go through it
Guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby
Loving you's a dirty job
(Loving you, loving you's a dirty job)
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when we'd never fake it
There were times we would always make it
There were times we would take it to the limit
And we'd never, ever, ever leave each other alone
We were flesh and blood and bone
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we took our chances
There were times we were damn good dancers
There were times when we heard all the answers
In the bleeding of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll
I can see right through your soul
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

If your fears could only be forgotten
We could pull all the barriers down
Would you follow your dreams' desire?
Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire?
Let's peel out of this town
It's been nothing but dreams
It's been nothing but dreams until now

You're never gonna see it
You got your head stuck in the sand
It's the land of the free and easy street
It's the home of the damned
Oh, you're never gonna see it
You better open up your eyes
You're the only one who's left
Who's gonna believe all your lies?

I can't explain it away
It doesn't make any sense
To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
You gotta go through it
You gotta go
It doesn't matter, baby
Loving you's a dirty job
(loving you, loving you's a dirty job)
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times when we'd lay in bed and listen
To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars 

There were times when we took our chances
There were times we were damn good dancers

Loving you's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars
There were times we'd extinguish every fire
That was burning, burning, burning, up each other alive

From the heavens on down to the dives
There were times we lost it all
There were times we lost it all 

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart

There were times we lost it all",Loving You's a Dirty Job (But Somebody's Gotta Do It),2016

Crept up from behind me now it's here to stay
Too real although it's not

Couldn't have possibly been avoided anyway

Holding back the forbidden places
Abolished music, lost for ages

Though dust has gathered on honest feeling
Forbidden truths through twilight stealing
And in the eyes of the listless faces

Glisten hints of forbidden places

There's truth in what they say

When all the things he loves are far away

And precious things
Are dreams unto an exile
They take him over
The land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree

And when the moonlight
Peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city
Wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel it's wonder or it's laughter
I'm once again back home in Inisfree

I wonder over green hills
Through dreamy valleys
And find a peace, no other land would know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing
As they flow

And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold
The folks I love
Around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee
Their rosary is told

But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality
But though they pave
The foot ways here with gold dust
I still would choose my Isle of Inisfree",Isle of Inisfree,2005

I flourished like a vine
There came along a false young man
That stole the heart of mine

Three offers he made to me
The pink, the violet and red rose
Which I refused all three

For it fades away too soon
And the violet is too pale a hue
I think I'll wait 'til June

In June the red rose blooms
That's not the flower for me
For then I'll pluck the red rose off
And plant a willow tree
And plant a willow tree

And the willow tree shall weep
And the willow tree shall whine
I wish I was in the young man's arms
That stole the heart of mine

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's there watching for me

Then straight to his arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

A burning hope that will not die.

And leave you waiting on the tide.

Time to fly, time to touch the sky.
One voice alone - a haunting cry.
One song, one star burning bright,
Let it carry me through darkest night.

Rain comes over the grey hills,
And on the air, a soft goodbye.
Hear the song that I sing to you,
When the time has come to fly.

When I leave and take the wing,
And find the land that fate will bring,
The brightest star in the evening sky,

Is your love waiting far for me.

What our good God for us has done

To God with love this Christmas day

There was a blessed Messiah born

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
To whom God's angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear

""Arise and go"", the angels said
""To Bethlehem, be not afraid
For there you'll find this happy morn'
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born""

With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went that Babe to find
And as God's angel had foretold
They did our Savior Christ behold

And by his side the Virgin maid
As long foretold upon that morn'

In the lane, snow is glistening

We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,

Aquella voz subía la intención
O bajaba si iba mal iba un poco mejor
En miles de movidas me metí
Por seguir de tras de ti
Pero al final encontré el lugar why en medio de la luz
Estabas esperando
Tu, tu why yo, tu why yo, tu why yo

Colgado de los palos why amarrado
Por los pies why por las manos
Me pregunté ¿quién lo pudo hacer?
Trepé por la madera why aparté
De tu cara la melena why te besé
Tres palabras rotas escapaban de tus labios
Tu, tu why yo, tu why yo, tu why yo
Tu, tu why yo, tu why yo, tu why yo
Tu, tu why yo, tu why yo, tu why yo

Porque el que muere
No vive más, no vive más",Otro Muerto,1998
Mecano,"Los Piratas del amor
De solteros vocación
Libre personal
Voy hablando de
Mi amigo why yo
Imposibles de fijar
A un solo caudal
Damos tumbos por
El ancho mar
Con el morro por bandera
Listos para abordar
No hay mujer sin tentación
A los piratas del amor
Why de palos ensamblamos
Nuestra balsa de fe
Con la risa se forjó
La cadena entre los dos
Pronto vimos que el amor
Tiende a naufragar
Si es en una
Sola dirección
Why aprendimos a besar
Sin planificar
Que para amarrar
Hay que soltar
Con el morro por bandera
Listos para abordar
No hay mujer sin tentación
A los piratas del amor
Why de palos ensamblamos
Nuestra balsa de fe
Con la risa se forjó
La cadena entre los dos

Mecano,"Dalí se desdibuja
Tirita
Su burbuja
Al desconfiar latidos
Dalí se decolora
Porque esta lavadora
No distingue tejidos
El se da cuenta
Y asustado se lamenta
Los genios no deben morir
Son mas de ochenta
Los que curvan tu osamenta
Eungenio Salvador Dalí

Bigote Rococó
De donde acaba el genio
A donde empieza el loco
Mirada deslumbrada
De donde acaba el loco
A donde empieza el hada
En tu cabeza se comprime la belleza
Como si fuese una olla express
Y es el vapor que va saliendo por la pesa
Mágica luz en cada que

Si te reencarnas en cosa
Hazlo en lápiz o en pincel
Y Gala de piel sedosa
Que lo haga en lienzo o en papel
Si te reencarnas en carne
Vuelve a reencarnarte en ti
Que andamos justos de genios
Eungenio Salvador Dalí

Realista y surrealista
Con luz de impresionista
Y trazo impresionante
Delirio colorista
Colirio y oculista
De ojos delirantes
En tu paleta mezclas místicos ascetas
Con ballonetas y con tetas
Y en tu cerebro Gala Dios y las pesetas
Buen catalán anacoreta

Si tu reencarnas en cosa
Hazlo en lápiz o en pincel
Y Gala de piel sedosa
Que lo haga en lienzo o en papel
Si te reencarnas en carne
Vuelve a reencarnarte en ti
Que andamos juntos de genios
Queremos que estés aquí

Mecca,"I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet feelin' it
Feel the Lex pushing up on the set I'm feelin' it
Feel the high that you get from the la feelin' it
If you feel it raise your L in the sky

I keep it realer than most I know your feeling it
Cristal on ice I like to toast I keep from spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price the circle of success-hey turned my mic up
I'm bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light your life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody would fall cause everyone would be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money what's the point?

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet feelin' it
Feel the Lex pushing up on the set I'm feelin' it
Feel the high that you get from the lye feelin' it
If you feel it raise your L in the sky

Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complaining
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplaning hey shorty (Where you disappear son?)
Maintaining putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living the ill streets blues got you hunger paining
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose you still slinging-fool
I'm thorough in every borough my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and
Ya Feelin' it? to all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers cant really know I'm loving it ya feelin' it

What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high?
The Cristal's they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams a sniper hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares mom
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all don't feel me
Enough to stop the illin' right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight I'm so confused
OK I'm getting weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself look I don't need that now
It just once in a blue when there's nothing to do and
The tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning me and the chick on the l and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man
It got me goin' shit
