When it's hard times
You help alleviate the pressure
I need you
You need me
Problems with you
They can come see me. Hahnnn
Need you on my side
Like a rib
If I'm the Four Fifth
You my extended clip
Hugs and kisses
Til' death do us part
Baby girl priceless
Like a work art
She got a big butt with a smile
Like her mama do
Me and her on teams
You know that's W
Break her off
You know ain't nothing to
The foreign push button
Her's push button too
Couldn't let you go
Even if I wanted to
If I die tonight
Tomorrow I'll be haunting you! Hold Up

Dora Bryan,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

Thugg niggaz
Ha-ha-ha
Callin all thugg niggaz
(callin all thugg niggaz)
This shit is for y'all
Worldwide
Just like geto boys
(geto boooys!)
I know y'all niggas gon' feel this shit right here
(g.b.!)
We're goin through the same thing

[ verse 1: willie d ]
Weapons bein loaded and cocked, bodies drop
Ghetto niggas, they hang on the corner sellin rocks
Fuck the cops, they brutalize the poverty-stricken
Institutional racism prevalent in prisons
Quick decisions are made with precisions of blood-spill
Gotta make a mill, got a house on the hill
Protect my grill, and avoid gettin killed
Now if I land on the concrete with bloody pants
Lord please, give your homeboy a second chance
Baby need a new pair of shoes, and a college fund
My p.o. wanna know how I got a gun
I'm in the presence of my enemies like in the bible
Will I see heaven if I murder these fuckin rivals?
I'm havin nightmares of niggas' final cries
If I die today, will I be idolized?
I gives a fuck, if you dwell from the east to west
As long as you feel the south, nigga, you can bet
I got...

[ chorus: doracell ]
Nothin but that gangsta shit to my thugs
Puffin on a gang of shit smokin luv
Niggas gangbang and shit, rub-a-dub
No matter what you claim and shit, throw it up (2x)

[ verse 2: doracell ]
Lord, see me, to the last year, my islamic roots
Forgive me what I past did, hustlin for loot
Pass the casket, lookin at my friend in basket
Touch him with my lips, feelin like he blasted
I never seen a man cry
But my lifestyle is fear, sittin around watchin muthafuckas die
The faces of death
Who coulda predicted 2pac would be next?
Read ghetto text: if you live by the sword
Or speak about it too much, you gon' die by the sword
So think about it, do us an injustice, you know time flies
Life, I can't trust it, so I stay high
Six-time felony, no one can handle me
I'm constantly fuckin up my family
To the moms a casualty, I got love
But this a little gangsta shit, to my thugs

[ chorus ]

[ verse 3: dmg ]
I be a muthafuckin thug till the day I die
Called in this world to be a rider, so I'm ridin high
My blood-shot eyes coincide with my frame of mind
Forever mobbin with my niggas from offa both sides
It's g.b. family, fuck y'all bitch-mades
We in the game to run the whole thang
Return and leave from a to z
Bonafied thug in my blood, part of the ghetto
Niggas runnin when I'm up in meadow
I'm black devil with the shovel when I'm near, nigga
Don't fear, nigga, this is war in yo ear, nigga
Right here, nigga, real niggas
Representin thugs, we all action
We body-baggin (body-baggin) and toe-taggin
Your reaction is flatline, no pulse
Straight killers, thugg niggaz with no heart

[ willie d ]
And that's how that shit go, nigga
We ain't gon' never stop doin this shit
I know them muthafuckas can't stand it
When them goddamn geto boys come hot
Cause we gotta represent niggas all over the muthafuckin world
We got geto boys all over the world
And that's why we always break shit down
To the muthafuckin smallest compound
Nigga, you fuck with us
You hoes'll get mugged, drugged
We ain't havin no muthafuckas down in the fuckin front row
Gettin kisses and hugs
Nigga, that's how we doin that shit
Down south, muthafucka

[ verse 4 scarface ]
Get em up, nigga, buck-buck, represent yo shit
Smokin weed got you fucked up, now you niggas hit
Fuck with me, nigga, what's up talkin all that shit
Now we face to face, muthafucka, who you with?
Ain't nobody got your back now, you in trouble
Oh, he know how to act now, huh? we in double
Always sickin out and stomp out, nigga gettin nervous
And that stutterin in your voice, pal, that's gon' get your service
Ain't no muthafuckin game, nigga, disrespect
Remember the next time that bullshit gon' get you x-ed
Do yo thang, but don't you ever trick
Don't you ever switch, if you get caught, then don't you ever snitch
If you do, you'se a bitch, full of shit
Lots of holes in ya
Pop a hole in a hoe nigga

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Get yo hands up, you see this nigga on a come-up
Walk into this bitch with a gun up in your sto-mach
Now point me to the nigga with the seven figures sittin
Assumin that nobody can hit him, I've come to get him
I'm starvin, it's 3 o'clock in the mornin
Wakin you up out your sleep without a warnin
Good morning, I come to get you for your digits
Oh, see this forty cal in my hand, she finna get it
Nobody speakin, don't blink, I probably think somebody reachin
You make a move, I leave your body leakin all weekend
Take me to the safe, and I can get you for your bucks
Or I can shoot this muthafucka up, I don't give a fuck
You make the call for all of why'all
You can use your brains to think with, or I can leave em hangin on the wall
What you do when a nigga come through with game too
Strictly for the nigga with scrilla and name you
A pastor will introduce you to this casket
Bullshittin me gon' get you blasted

[ VERSE 2: Willie D ]
Nigga, I be crunk-crunk when it jump-jump
Leavin muthafuckas slump-slump
In a trunk-trunk, I pump-pump
Bullets into the flesh and leave you naked
Stop prayin for this muthafucka, he ain't gon' make it
You have to take it straight to his muthafuckin dome
If anybody come lookin for him, tell him he gone
Can't you see his muthafuckin eyes jumpin around
Can't you see his muthafuckin thighs humpin the ground
It's goin down, when times are hard I feel like this
Before I starve I'ma kill me a bitch
Shit, I want that muthafuckin dope and the cash
And I can take it out your pockets or your ass
Don't make me blast
The last way you want to see me is disgruntled
Cause I shoot you in your muthafuckin face and leave you horizontal
My .45 signfies who's boss
You play with me, I have your ass startin the news off
Close your fuckin mouth and keep your dicksuckers tight as a gurtle
Don't turn this robbery into a murder
Unless you tired of livin, put your possession in my custody
My finger's itchy, don't you fuck with me

[ CHORUS: Scarface ]
[ VERSE 3: Doracell ]
Wake your ass up and shove, nigga, good morning
Oh, what it's all about, Doracell is in your home and
The pistol's in your mouth, nigga, and it's on and
I represent that South, nigga, I bring it on and
Muthafucka, make this shit a simple situation, give me the loot
??? your baby and that bitch, I'ma shoot, and that's the truth
My pistol piece up against the wig
I ain'ts to be up in this bitch for long, nigga, you dig?
You baby-sit? Nigga, I don't give a fuck
A nigga fresh out of prison, down on my luck
What's up, cold steel touchin on your dome
Excellent chrome about to roam through your home
Break yourself and I'm gone, it's all about the cheddar

Alles geht fort, auch du bist weg.

Ich bin doch nicht blind, ich seh' genau.

Drehst dich nicht mehr um.
Alles bleibt stumm.

Ich will Dich vergessen so hart wie's ist

Mein Mädchen ich schreib dir diesen Brief, ich hoff' du liest ihn auch.
Tut mir leid wie's jetzt gekommen ist, ich musste einfach raus.
Das Leben ist schon komisch gerade wenn man erst mal glaubt,
Besser kann's nicht laufen dann zerfällt alles zu Staub.
Wir waren das Überteam, auf den Straßen Südberlins.
Und egal was ich für scheiße baute, du hast mir verziehen.
Ich weiß wir haben uns geschworen niemals kleinbeizugeben.
Doch jetzt stehst du meinetwegen, da allein und weinst im Regen.
Alles ist Trauer, ich denk' nur an die Zeit mit dir.
Reiß dein Foto von der Wand doch du bleibst ein Teil von mir.
Danke das du nicht so blind bist wie ich.
Ich hoffe du vergisst mich

Doch ich schreib dir jetzt diese Zeilen, 
Auch wenn ich weiß das du mich hasst.
Mein Schatz du musst mir glauben, du warst mein Lebenslicht.
Doch ich kann nicht aus meiner Haut.
Baby manchmal geht es nicht.
Ich glaub das ganze Glück mit uns war zu viel für mich.
Sag nicht's bitte, ich find' mich selber manchmal widerlich.
Es klingt bescheuert, doch ich weiß du wirst mich verstehen.
Alles kommt anders als man denkt, bitte lass mich gehen.
Ich denk an deine Stimme sie klingt so wie tausend Engel.
Da wo ich jetzt bin mal ich deinen Namen auf die grauen Wände.
Danke das du nicht so blind bist wie ich.
Ich hoffe du vergisst mich
Ich hoff' du vergisst mich nicht.

Ich denke geh mal rüber' sprich sie an das geht schon klar
Ich zieh' mein T-Shirt grade und richte die Frisur 
Ich lass die Kette Funkeln 
Ich hoff' sie sieht die Uhr 
Sonnenbrille auf ich seh' wie Bruce Willis aus 
Ich weiß sie will es auch sie ist bestimmt 'ne wilde Sau
Ich hol zwei Drinks und stell mich neben sie doch sie haut ab 
Weil sie mir zeigen will das die hautenge Jeans ihr auch passt
Ich lauf ihr hinterher immer hinter ihrem Hintern 
Ich sag ich hab so'n kribbeln im Bauch 
Sie sagt das sei mein Blinddarm ich frag sie nach einem Date 
Nur wir zwei ganz privat ich will sie mit 'ner Limousine abholen doch sie sagt

Nein, so geht es nicht
Ich seh' dich nicht
Nichts überredet mich
Ich bin nicht so leicht zu haben
Nein, ich hab kein Durst dich hab ich auch satt 
Los Junge hau ab soweit dich deine Beine tragen 
Es fällt mir nicht im Traum ein deine Frau zu sein 
Solange du mir nicht mal anständig den Hof machst 
Pack' die Ringe und das Auto wieder ein 
Ich scheiß' auf Diamanten wer braucht schon so was
Ich brauch' oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (kannste haben) 
Ich brauch' oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Okay dann Plan B
Aufgeben ist nicht drin
Ich muss ihr wohl mal kurz
Erzählen wer ich bin ich rap' mein Block vor
Ein Teil von mir, steh' wieder auf all die Hits und all die unbekannten Lieder auch
Und sie findet alles scheiße besonders Straßenjunge 
Sie sagt das Video ist grottenschlecht und die armen Hunde
Und überhaupt Hip Hop ist gar nicht ihr Ding
Sie hört lieber Christina Aguilera, denn die kann singen 
Sie sagt Hip Hopper sehen scheiße aus mit ihren schiefen Mützen 
Auch die weiten Hosen und die Gang Art findet sie beschissen 
Ich sag ich mach jetzt nur noch die Musik, die sie mag ich zieh' mich an wie Pete Doherty 
Wenn sie will doch sie sagt

Nein, so geht es nicht
Ich seh' dich nicht
Nichts überredet mich

Ich brauch oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Jetzt ist Schluss mit lustig jetzt 
Zieh' ich alle Register ich werd' zum Raubtier 
Es hagelt, es knallt und gewittert 
Es gibt kein Entkommen mehr, du willst es doch auch 
Komm her, ich mach auch auf Gentleman als ob ich James Bond wär
Ich kauf dir ein Ring doch du willst ihn nicht 
Ich hol Picasso aus dem Grab er malt ein Bild für dich 
Ich schick dir tausend Briefe, zehn tausend SMS 
Ich schreib dir, hi ich bin's dein Traummann lass mal treffen jetzt 
Du interessierst mich, doch du zierst dich und trotzdem geht es mir gut 
Sobald du bei mir bist, bitte gib mir nicht noch ein Korb
Das wär zu hart Baby ich würde alles für dich tun aber du sagst

And just when
You think you're sick of living here the memory floods in
The morning light off the fire escapes
The nights in Bennett Park blasting Big Pun tapes
I'm 'a miss this place, to tell you the truth:
Kevin dispensin' wisdom from his dispatch booth
And at dawn, Vanessa at the salon, we gotta move on
But who's gonna notice we're gone?

When our job's done, as the evening winds
Down to a crawl, son, can I ease my mind
When we're all done? When we've resigned
In the long run, what do we leave behind?
Most of all, I'll miss Abuela's whispers
Doin' the Lotto Pick Six every Christmas
In five years, when this whole city's rich folks and hipsters
Who's gonna miss this raggedy little business?

Doreen Wayne,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

What?

Nothin'
No, I know what it'd be like
It'd be awful! I can just see myself

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Self respect and the will to rise above
Whatever happened to the right thing to do
Love your brother, let peace abide with you

Whatever happened to live and let live
Tolerance and a willingness to give
Whatever happened to the goodness in a man
Was good ever there or has good lost its hand

Whatever happened to the drive to learn
To better oneself just because one yearns
Whatever happened to the unique voice
The one of a kind giving us a greater choice

Whatever happened to striving towards goals
Seems we're our own worst enemy and foe

Te he adorado y te he odiado

Que en los peores momentos
Llevas dentro un ángel negro
Que nos hunde a los dos

Y cuando llega el nuevo día
Me juras que cambiarías sí
Pero vuelves a caer
Te dolerá todo el cuerpo
Me buscarás en el infierno
Porque soy igual que tú

Todo lo que siento por ti
Sólo podría decirlo así

Para viajar a otros planetas
Por corrientes circulares
Te di una cápsula especial
Pero ahora tú cabeza
Es una tormenta de arena
Y cada noche una espiral

Doriand,"Je passe ma vie dans les piscines
J'aime bien que les choses soient carrées
Sur mon matelas, oui je bouquine
Entre Miami et L.A.

On veut m'éjecter de mon siège
On veut me voir couler au fond
Mais comme un p'tit bouchon de liège
Et hop! Je remonte d'un seul bond

Oh, croyez moi j'ai la peau dure
Elle ne crant ni le soleil, ni le chlore
J'en vois qui comptent leurs brûlures
Moi, j'affiche un bronzage couleur or

Dans les piscines
Moi, je reste en surface
Juste au dessus des profondeurs
Mais toujours à la même place
Pendant que les autres font des longueurs

L'amour m'attend dans un bain moussant
Qu'on me rappelle son prénom
Je le rejoins dans un instant
Et cette fois, je vais aimer pour de bon

J'ai des cuisiniers et leurs étoiles
Un jardinier sous mes palmiers
Un skipper pour mettre les voiles
Oh, j'aime être entouré de gens passionés
C'est ça, des gens qui aiment leur métier, voyez?

Mon eau est toujours impeccable
Y'a un petit robot qui nettoie
Il faut le voir, c'est adorable
Aspirer les fourmis qui se noient

Dans les piscines
Moi, je reste en surface
Juste au dessus des profondeurs

Mais toujours à la même place
Je suis le messie
Qui vient vous remercier

Si au hasard d'un listing
Votre nom est souligné
Alors vous irez faire des longueurs
Des longueurs

On a beau allumer la lumière
Y'a toujours un regard qui me fuit
Et dire que c'est lui qui me poursuit

Et j'ausculte
Comme un médecin maniaque
L'infini dans leur bleu démoniaque
J'y plonge en secret pendant que tu dors
Certain d'y trouver des îles au trésor

Je veux savoir, quitte à m'y noyer
Dans le fond de tes yeux qui tu es
Je n'ai pas peur de toutes ces guerres inutiles
Que j'ai perdues en un seul battement de cils

Et aprfois, j'y fais venir des larmes
Ca fait louped...mais le bon Dieu d'acharne
A c'que le soleil brille sur toi
C'est quand même étrange
Ces microclimats

Je veux savoir, quitte à m'y noyer
Dans le fond de tes yeux qui tu es

It wouldn’t be enough time to tell you

That God has kept me so safe

So I must give Him…
Give Him praise…Give Him praise

That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day,

92 today
Running off with Sadie Lee

Doris Day,"Love, are you nuts?
Some people can't tell when it hits them! 

All you gotta do is say hello to a man
And they've got you whispering in his ear

All you gotta do it seems is work for him
And they've got you going beserk for him

If there's a guy you merely have a bicker with
They've got you setting the wedding date

It seems they've just gotta have some dirt 
To bend your ear with

So before you start, I herewith state

I'm not at all in love, not at all in love, not I
Not a bit, not a mite
Though I'll admit he's quite a hunk o' guy
But he's not my cup o' tea, not my cup o' tea, not he
Not an ounce, not a pinch
He's just an inch too sure of himself for me

Well of course you've noticed his manly physique and that look in his eyes
Say, I'm sure he can cut most any man down to size
He must he as fierce as a tiger when he's mad
And I'll bet he cries like a little boy when he's sad

But I'm not at all in love, not at all in love, not I
Not a straw, not a hair
I don't care if he's as strong as a lion
Or if he has the rest of ya sighin'
You may be sold, but this girl ain't buyin'
I'm not at all in love!

She's not at all in love, not at all in love, oh no
Not a pin, not a crumb
Must be the summer heat that gives her that glow
'Cos she's not at all in love, not at all in love, she cries
Not a snip, not a bite
Must be the light from the ceiling shining there in her eyes

He's young and handsome, and smart, and we can't get over it
But this lady's heart he doesn't effect a bit
It's easy to see that her daffy grin is the grin she always wears
And she's breathless because she ran up a flight of stairs
Obviously!
Naturally!
Definitely!
Obviously!
Naturally!
Definitely!
Hah!

She's not at all in love, not at all in love, not she
No, I'm not!
Not a dot
Not a touch
No, not much
When I fall in love, there will be no doubt about it
'Cos you will know from the way that I shout it
Your shouting
I haven't fallen
She hasn't fallen

She's not at all in love!",I'm Not at All in Love,1957

The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo

The rattle of the taxis

At Angelo's and Maxi's

It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that

And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

Doris Day,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen,1990
Doris Day,"When it's beau night
In Hotchkiss Corner
You'll find the gang out
At Harem's hangout

Slipping all their nickels in the jukebox
And jivin' madly

The way that they ride

As with girlies in gingham, swingin'
Like they do up at the savoy

I asked my mother, what will I be
Will I be pretty
Will I be rich

Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que será, será

I asked my sweetheart, what lies ahead
Will we have rainbows

Let's walk a-that-a-way not a-this-a-way
That-a-way we can be alone
Take they're throwing our chance to kiss away
This-a-way only leads to home

Notice that we're coming to the crossroads
Should we turn to left or right?
Mother is a-rockin' and a-waitin'
But it's such a lovely night

[Chorus]

Well, don't you think the valley road is shorter?
We could save about a mile
And now and then the short road can be longer
If you linger for a while

(Chorus)

Can't you see the night is just beginning
And the moonlight weaves a spell
We can take the road among the daisies
You know daisies never tell

Little ol' words like 'I love you'
Everything you say is so convincing
Yes, that's what we ought to do

Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

How humiliating! How delightful!

Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

Take a position and staunchly never budge.

Let her shiver, let her moan,

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star,1997

Just like the ones I used to know

Doris Day,"Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin' in spite of the chill in
The weather

Love knows no seasons, love knows no climb
Romance can blossom, any old time
Here in the open, we're walkin' and hopin'
Together

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful site, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in the winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings his love song, as we go along
Walkin' in the winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made

Doris Day,"Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,
And now tell me what have I got?

I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint
I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a cellar, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal

Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun

If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,

Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister

Oh you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles

Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie

Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies, one for every year

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers, and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed

(sign ... our heart's are playing tag)
When you say (we just got to be home by twelve)
But don't I always say let's go 'cause you take longer to say good night than any three others I know
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the super duper special way) goodnight
(The way you have me flying higher than a kite)
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb
(It looks as though you're never going)

But no angel ever came along
Then one happy afternoon I met you
And my heart began to sing a song

You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song to you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four

The human little faults that you do have
Just make me love you more

It makes the cloudy day sunny
Makes the bee think of honey

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt the gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then, and then
Find it's only your imagination again
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example, I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

You hate to have me call you Pretty Baby; 
I really thought that I was pleasing you, 
For you're just a baby to me. 
Your cunning little dimples and your baby stare, 
Your baby talk and baby walk and curly hair; 
Your baby smile makes life worth while, 
You're just as sweet as you can be.

Your mother says you were the cutest kid; 
No wonder, dearie, that I'm wild about you, 
And all the cunning things you said and did. 
Why, I love to fondly recall, 
Ann just like Peter Pan, it seems you'll always be 
The same sweet, cunning, Little Baby dear to me. 
And that is why I'm sure that I will always love you best of all.

Everybody loves a baby that's why I'm in love with you, 
Pretty Baby, Pretty Baby; 
And I'd to be your sister, brother, dad and mother too, 
Pretty Baby, Pretty Baby.

And we'll cuddle all the time.

I've hung around you just like a fool

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Doris Drew,"Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die
No matter where you chance to be

So I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm 'til you return
So give me something I can remember you by
When you are far away from me

So I'll pray for you, every single day for you
It will see me through like a charm until you return

When you are far away from me",Something to Remember You By,1957
