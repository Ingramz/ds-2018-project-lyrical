Who's got a million friends

That's what they ca-a-all me
'Cause I'm so lo-o-onely
Since I lost you-ou

Blue-ue-ue boy
I'm known as blue-ue-ue boy
You found a new-ew-ew boy
And now we're through

I had a twinkle in my eye
When our sweet love was new
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you

Blue-ue-ue boy
I'll be a blue-ue-ue boy
Until you nee-ee-eed me

Jim Reeves,"Out where the bright lights are glowing
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wine's over flowing
While I sit and whisper your name

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love, not for hating
So here where you've left me, I'll stay

One night with you is like heaven
And so, while I'm walking the floor
I'll listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Closing in on me",Four Walls [#],1987
Jim Reeves,"When all your loves have ended
When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone

Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
But how many fools would have you
I know one

This fool keeps wondering why
He fell in love at all
But you might need this fool 
Around in case you fall

After the party's over
And you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you
I know one (I know one)

You never know you might be lonely
When all your loves have missed (fool, fool, foll)
It wouldn't hurt to keep
An extra fool on your list

After your heart's been broken
And you needs a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you
I know one (yes)

I know one (umm hum)
I know one",I Know One [#],1987
Jim Reeves,"Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
I missed me how I missed me at your house last night

Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands",I Missed Me [#],1987
Jim Reeves,"I walked by the river
Where we said goodbye,
Thought of your kisses,
And didn't even cry
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better

I talked with an old friend,
He asked about you
I managed to tell him
With just a tear or two
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better

I know I'll never be the same
I was standin' too close to the flame
But it doesn't hurt so much
To hear your name
I think I'll make it, I'm gettin' better",I'm Getting Better [#],1987
Jim Reeves,"All around the water tank waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home sleepin' in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
Get off get off you railroad bum he slammed the boxcar door

Well he put me off in Texas a state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars up above
Nobody seems to want me or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco goin' back to Dixie Land
My pocketbook is empty my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home waitin' for a train",Waiting for a Train [#],1987
Jim Reeves,"Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

I fell in love with a pretty little thing
I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as sweet could be
'Till I found out what she did to me

Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

I asked her mother to let her go
She whispered, Mother, please tell him no
Though he may think that I am true
There're plenty more who think so too

Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

Now I won't cry my life away
Some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone
I guess I'll hear him sing this song

Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal

Jim Reeves,"After awhile after awhile I'll learn to smile after awhile
I'll love again when my heart mends
I'll leave heartbreaks out high after awhile
Some day you'll learn just how I feel
When love brings you heartache only time can heal
After awhile after awhile I'll learn to smile after awhile




",After Awhile,1989
Jim Reeves,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone. 
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone. 
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low, 
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go. 

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true, 
Or is he holding you the way I do? 
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know, 
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go? 

You can't say the words I want to hear 
While you're with another man, 
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,"" 
Darling, I will understand. 

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.

Jim Reeves,"I'd like to be the picture on your mantel 
I'd like to be the window in your door
I'd like to be the feather on your pillow 
I'd even like to be the carpet on your floor
I'd like to be the star outside your window 
That lucky chair that holds you every night
The puppy pop you warm up every morning 
I'd even like to be the apple that you bite
And if you need someone to talk with 
I'd like to be the little voice inside
And if you'll ever have a heartache 
I want to be the tear you hide
I'd like to the be the record on your phonograph 
The melody that action night and day
And when you're old enough to want to marry
I'd like to be the one who steals your heart away

And if you need someone to talk with...",I'd Like to Be,1989
Jim Reeves,"I promise you he'll never know
That once we loved each other so
The past we knew I'll not reveal

My heart may cry with every beat
Without your love I'm not complete
It doesn't matter how I feel
My lips are sealed

Let there be laughter
Not one single tear
And ever after
Let your fears disappear

If you love him as I love you
Forget the past I led you through
Just don't look back it's all concealed

Jim Reeves,"From a jack to a king
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen
And walked away with your heart

From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
And made me king of your heart

For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a jack to a king
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen
You made me king of your heart

For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a jack to a king
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an ace and I won a queen
You made me king of your heart



",From a Jack to a King,1990
Jim Reeves,"Irene goodnight Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene I'll see you in my dreams

Last Saturday night I got married me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife have parted so I'll take another stroll downtown
Irene goodnight Irene...

Sometimes I live in the country sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a great notion to jump in the river and drown
Irene goodnight Irene...




",Goodnight Irene,1990
Jim Reeves,"This is the moment I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing soon bells will be ringing
This is the moment of sweet Aloha
I will love you longer than forever promise me that you will leave me never

Here and now dear all my love I vow dear
Promise me that you will leave me never I will love you longer than forever
Now that we are one clouds won't hide the sun
Blue skies of Hawaiian smile on this our wedding day

I do love you with all my heart",The Hawaiian Wedding Song,1990
Jim Reeves,"Mona Lisa Mona Lisa men have named you you're so like the lady with a mistic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa's strangest in your smile

Do you smile to tempt the lover Mona Lisa or is this your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie that and they'd die there

Do you smile to tempt the lover",Mona Lisa,1990
Jim Reeves,"Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in?
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then

Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind

Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this world of mine

I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world

Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world",Welcome to My World,1990
Jim Reeves,"Why do I love you I love you not only for what you are
But for what I am when I'm with you
I love you not only for what you've made of yourself
But for what you're making of me
I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me
And for laying firm hold of the possibilities for good in me
Why do I love you I love you for closing your eyes to the dischords
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy
You have done it without a word without a touch without a sign
You have done it just by being yourself and after all perhaps that's what love means",Why Do I Love You (Melody of Love),1990
Jim Reeves,"You'll never know just how much, I love you
You'll never know just how much, I care
And if I tried I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know for haven't I told you so

Are many or more times you went away
And my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every breath
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now",You'll Never Know,1990
Jim Reeves,"Trying to forget the thrill of holding you will I ever stop thinking of hapiness we knew
Who are you thinking of in your dreams at night
Who are you longing for when you hug your pillow tight
But I'll forget I'll forget I know I will

Maybe I will find a heart that's true and a love that's real
Trying to forget the times you broke my heart
Remembering how happy you made me at the start
Please won't you listen I want you to know though you have hurt me I still love you so",Trying to Forget,1990
Jim Reeves,"He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit playin' cards and a shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well I had a friend named Rambling Bob who used to steal gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday that Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way downtown

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit playin' cards and a shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well I went out last Tuesday, met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man in town
Well she started in to spend my money, she started in to call me honey
We took in every honky tonk in town

We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now

Oh, I hope that you won't end up here
If your new romance turns out a failure
Here's where to find me, my dear

I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops
On a bar-stool, not doin' so well

But no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror
With only the ghost of a smile

For things never change in this place
There's no present, no past, no future
We're the ones who have lost in love's race

Than to love and be loved by me
I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea

But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee

So that her high-born kinsmen came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes, that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea

That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my beautiful Annabel Lee
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many who were wiser than we

And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul
From the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me
Dreams of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes

Jim Reeves,"While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled from the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well sir he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need suckin' I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the bad
Well guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
Guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Evening to you Lord and watch us over tonight
And don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord,1996
Jim Reeves,"As I write this letter to you darlin'
I can't hold the teardrops from my eyes
For at sundown I will lay a-dyin'
At the door of the Fool's Paradise

Rode into this cattle town this mornin'
Left my burro to check the market price
And I walked into the nearest barroom
They call it the Fool's Paradise

There the crowd was gay and girls were dancin'
And the men were playin' cards and dice
So I stepped up to the bar to join them
What a grand place this Fool's Paradise

It was then I showed to them your picture
I passed it around once or twice
Then a man insulted your sweet honour
At the bar of the Fool's Paradise

So I slapped his face and I told him, I says
""You eat them words Mister, or draw, that's my advice""
And he said, ""Well, somebody might get hurt inside
But I'll be glad to meet you in the street at sundown
At sundown in front of the Fool's Paradise""

So goodbye my darlin', may God bless you
I go to make this sacrifice

Jim Reeves,"This is the story of love that came undone
This is the story of two men
And a gun of two men and a gun

A man that I'd never met stole my wife and son
But that's been nearly three years now
And it's over with and done

At first I'd stare out into space
While hate consumed my soul
Hate was the creed by which I lived
And revenge my only goal

But the road to happiness isn't paved with hate
I'm glad I learned how to forgive before it was too late

Now here's the way the other man
Paid for what he'd done
I heard it from the man's own lips
Who took my wife and son

I didn't really know this man but I'd seen him 'round
He's a new guard at the factory
Where I work, west of town

This fellow swung into step with me and said I've got to talk
I listened spellbound at his words
As we stood on the walk

You, the guard said hoarsely
Are a kind man, I surmise
As he stood there with his handkerchief
Wiping in his eyes

Three years ago I wronged a man
I stole his wife and son
I didn't realize then the terrible thing that I had done

This thing gets hold of me at night
And I can't sleep or rest
Forgive me, sir, but telling it
Seems to get it off my chest

When my past looms up like this
It kinda helps me to unload
I'm one man, sir, who knows for sure
That you reap just what you sow

I sure appreciate your listening, it helps me a lot
You know to have that man's forgiveness
I'd give everything I've got

Well, I feel much better now I, I didn't get your name
More why that was my wife's name before we wed
It's odd your name's the same

You know I'd kill a man
Who'd do to me the thing that I've done
And when the truth got through to him
He handed me his gun

As I gave the weapon back
I said what's done is done
All I ask is just be kind to Jenny and my son

",The Gun,1996
Jim Reeves,"Oh, Gypsy heart when you hear the whistle of a train
You forget the promise that you made down in lover's lane
You forget the kisses warm

Hear the whistle blow
Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Away, away you go
Gypsy heart you want love but not the settled kind
You'll be the death of love for me oh gypsy heart of mine.

I met a girl Birmingham with eyes so big and blue
I loved her since she said I cannot roam my dear with you
She said I want a little home
A heart to love and not roam
I'm sure someday you'll find your own a gypsy heart like you.

Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Hear the whistle blow
Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Away, away you go
Up till now the girls you've loved have all been very smart
They know even the change of love can't bind your gypsy heart.

Gypsy heart the wind that blows so far across the sea
Most of you will come along there's pretty things to see
In Ireland there are fair colleens
And songs of long ago
And the lovely ladies down in Spain oh gypsy heart let's go.

Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Hear the whistle blow
Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Away, away you go
You've been doin' everything since Noah sailed his ark
So let's keep rolling 'til we find another gypsy heart.

I'm waiting for ships that never come in.
I wonder where they can be?

[Spoken]
Life is only a game of poker
And happiness is the partner
They deal you five cards in the cradle
And you play wether your like it or not.

Some get a pat hand to start with
And the game doesn't seem on the square
When you look at your hand and discover
You were born without even a pair.

But there's no use in kicking or squawking
Just pick up your cards and begin
To figure and plan and puzzle
While fate looks on with a grin.

Some take a chance at bluffing
And stake everything they've got
On a little dinky little poor flush
And sometimes that wins a plot.

Others will break up openers
To draw for a middle straight
They know what a chance they're takin'
And they learned their mistake, too late.

Some can't play crooked
Against all good advice
But they seldom get away with it
And in the end they've paid the price.

The most of us play straight poker
But I'll tell you boys it's hard
When you're there with both ends open
And you can't draw the winning card

Now, I've always been a loser
It seems that I never can win
And I'm just a dreamer who's waiting
For ships that never come in.

You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the mystery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be if they come passing by

Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes or seen things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were beggers some were kings and some were masters of the arts

How he saved me from the chargin' bull that gored my Dad to death
As a kid I'd dream of bears and tremble to my toes

And all the dreary winter nights since I'd been away
Have Tige meet me here like this I was I was really glad
Cause I hadn't needed Tige so much since the day they'd burried Dad

A giant Dam was being built where the old road used to go
I thank the Lord for sending Tige and I followed where he led
Knowing well without his help that I'd be good as dead

And I could hear the water lappin' at the ledges far below
Then through the mist I saw a light and mother in her chair
And I reached down to pet old Tige but he wasn't there

Then you were gone and he lay dead a smile upon his lips
He knew this was the last time you'd give him the slip

Knew too the price for stolen love was just too much to pay
Perhaps I too can smile like him when my life ebbs away
He's coming out to lead me on to that little cell-like room
I fancy your face is smiling as we walk through the gloom
Perhaps you've found another who wants a rendezvous

Take me to the green valley they'll lay the sod o'er me

Jim Reeves,"Too many parties and too many pals
Will break your heart someday
Too many boyfriends and sociable sals
May drive your sweetheart away

Gentlemen of the jury
The judge's speech began
The scene was a crowded courtroom
And the judge a stern old man

This prisoner here before you
Is a social enemy
A lady of the evening
And you know the penalty

Her eyes reflect the nightlife
Her cheeks they're red with paint
But I knew her mother, gentlemen
Why her mother was a saint

Now I know that she's not like her
And yet she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin
We took the night life off the streets
And brought it in our own homes

While girls beguiled with lipstick
Danced to saxophones
We opened up the underworld
To the ones we loved so well

So tell me gentlemen is it right
To send her to a cell?
If she drinks while you taught her
And if she smokes you showed her how

So gentlemen do you think it's right
To condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room
Just remember there and then

That for every fallen woman
There's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a verdict
On what this girl has done

Just remember there's a man to blame
And that man might be your son
Now gentlemen that's my story
My testimony stands

This girl is my own daughter
And the case is in your hands

Sounds at too many parties and too many pals

Jim Reeves,"It was a stylish congregation you could see they'd been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the Amen Corner of that church sat Brother Ayer
And he insisted every Sunday on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he'd get behind and miss the words
Well the choir got so flustered the church was told in fine
That Brother Ayer must stop his singing or the choir was going to resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
And they got in their big fine cars and drove up to Ayer's door
They find the choir's great trouble sittin' there in an old arm chair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow white hair
Said York we're here dear Brother with the vestries approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now it seems that your voice has interfered with the choir
So if you'll just lay out are you listening Brother Ayer
The old man raised his head a sign that he had hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master and I shall meet
Yes I wonder if when I try to sing the song of God up higher
I wonder if they'll kick me out of there for singing in heaven's choir
A silence filled the little room and the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ayer was dead
The choir missed him for awhile but he was soon forgotten
A few church goers watched the door but the old man entered not
Far away his voice is sweet and he sings his heart desire
Where are there no church committees and no fashionable choirs

But now I'm down to my last dime
I had a sweetheart but I was unfaithful
Oh I've lived a lot in my time

I fought the grim reaper down in the dark valley
Prayed when the sun wouldn't shine
I've looked through the bars of a cold lonely prison
Yes, I've lived a lot in my time

I've been a soldier and I've been a rambler
Once thought that everything was fine
I've put in the cornfields, I've picked in the cotton
Yes I've lived a lot in my time

A Louisiana couple had a red-headed son
No name suited him, Jim, Jack or Joe
So they just called him Billy Bayou

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

Billy was a boy, kinda big for his size
Red hair, freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born
Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

One sad day Billy cried, ""Ho Ho!
I can lick the feathers off of Geronimo""
He started off, the chief got mad
This nearly ended our Louisiana lad

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

One day in eighteen seventy-eight
A pretty girl walked through Bill's front gate
He didn't know whether to stand there or run
He wound up married 'cause he didn't either one

Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
I missed me how I missed me at your house last night

Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through I'll and misfortune all others above.

People want to see him when he comes their way
He spreads so much joy everywhere he goes

He's always lucky with the cards that got a face
At winning the money, he is sure a whiz
But when they win they don't collect
'Cause they don't know where he is

From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven (Shure They Call It Ireland) [*],2008

She maintained her composure knowing full well inside she was a kid
She said: ""at least we're starting out honest boy
That's something my parents never did"".

And the night rumbled and it quaked
And the traffic light turned from red to green

From another boy
Trying to bring her father to his knees.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly

I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Over the shadows and the rain

Jim Stafford,"Black water Hattie lived back in the swamp
Where the strange green reptiles crawl
Snakes hang thick from the cypress trees
Like sausage on a smokehouse wall
Where the swamp is alive with a thousand eyes
An' all of them watching you
Stay off the track to Hattie's Shack in the back of the Black Bayou

Way up the road from Hattie's Shack
Lies a sleepy little Okeechobee town
Talk of swamp witch Hattie lock you in when the sun go down
Rumors of what she'd done, rumors of what she'd do
Kept folks off the track of Hattie's shack
In the back of the Black Bayou

One day brought the rain and the rain stayed on
And the swamp water overflowed
Skeeters and the fever grabbed the town like a fist
Doctor Jackson was the first to go
Some say the plague was brought by Hattie
There was talk of a hangin' too 
But the talk got shackled by the howls and the cackles
From the bowels of the Black bayou

Early one morn 'tween dark and dawn when shadows filled the sky
There came an unseen caller on a town where hope run dry
In the square there was found a big black round 
Vat full of gurgling brew

Whispering sounds as the folk gathered round
""It came from the Black Bayou""
There ain't much pride when you're trapped inside
A slowly sinkin' ship
Scooped up the liquid deep and green
And the whole town took a sip
Fever went away and the very next day the skies again were blue
Let's thank old Hattie for savin' our town
We'll fetch her from the Black Bayou

Party of ten of the town's best men headed for Hattie's Shack
Said Swamp Witch magic was useful and good
And they're gonna bring Hattie back
Never found Hattie and they never found the shack
Never made the trip back in
There was a parchment note they found tacked to a stump 
Said don't come lookin' again.",Swamp Witch,1974

And face this, man to man.

Jim Stafford,"Let me tell you about Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand

He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride

[Spoken] 
Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
Would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
Swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
The sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had

A thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
For some time now behind the sultan's back and you
Could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
Dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert

Air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
Which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel sound), 
Which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""
Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)

In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug with...

[Spoken in falsetto and possibly with female backups] 
""Rings on her fingers and
Bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""

[Spoken] 
There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
Beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
Bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
Sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,

Watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
Magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
It's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist

Again like we did last summer, baby.!!"" Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
Give him one of the sly looks,
She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

Jim Stafford,"Well, a strange thing happened the other night
You won't believe it, but I swear it's true
Harry the hairy ape made his escape from the city zoo
& under cover of darkness he made his way
To the middle of the municipal park
& he hid in the bushes & waited for somebody to come
Walkin' along by hi'self in the dark
Then along come somebody not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest (sound effect of this action)
Jump up & down & he say:
Wooo-hoo-hee-hee-hoo-hoo...
Which is Harry-Ape talk for ""Boo, I betcha I scared you, ha ha!""

Waaa!  Scared that poor cat so bad his eyes bugged out, his hair turned white!
He ran off through the municipal park, screamin', hollerin', diggin' up the lawn,
  tearin' up the shrub & knock down the ""Keep off the grass"" sign, run through the
  hurricane fence, fell into the municipal park swimming pool & drowned hi'self!  Woo
  hoo!

Well, Harry thought this was the funniest thing that he had ever seen
& he laughed ""Ha ha,"" jumped back in the bushes & got ready to do it again
The next guy to come along was the near-sighted local DJ
Just boppin' down the sidewalk on his way to work with a box of records on his arm
  that he was gonna play
So here he come, not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest (sound effect of this action)
Jump up & down & he say:
Wooo-hoo-hee-hee-hoo-hoo...
Which is Harry-Ape talk for ""Smile, you're on candid camera!""

Man, that DJ was so near-sighted he thought Harry was a rock 'n' roll singer!
So he gave him the old glad hand, smiled, slapped him on the back, sayin',
""Don't worry, baby, I'm gonna play the record 'cause you're too cool, too cool, too
cool!"" & he said bye, bopped on off down the sidewalk; every 4 or 5 steps he'd stop &
turn around,
  doin' a little boogaloo-shing-a-ling!
Well, this really shook Harry up, I mean it blew his whole bit, you know, ruined his
whole day So he run back to his cage as fast as he can go, jump up on his little swing,
put both hands
  over his eyes & didn't look for 3 hours & 45 minutes.  But that's not the end of the
  story
Here's what happened:

The DJ played Harry's record (What record?) Shut up!
It was a hit and he became a star
Got him some tight britches, got him a manager
Went on a promotion tour, combed his hair back & took up playin' the guitar
& every Sunday afternoon you can go see Harry at the zoo
& the girls will scream & he'll sit on his swing & pick & sing his hit record for you

Jim Stafford,"The wildwood flower grew wild on the farm,
And we never knowed what it was called.
Some said it was a flower and some said it was weed,
I never gave it much thought
One day I was out there talking to my brother,
Reached down for a weed to chew on,
Things got fuzzy and things got blurry,
And then everything was gone!
Didn't know what happened,
But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin' burlap.

I come to and my brother was there,
And he said, What's wrong with your eyes?
I said, I don't know, I was chewing on a weed.
He said, Let me give it a try.
We spent the rest of that day and most of that night,
Trying to find my brother, Bill.
Caught up with him, 'bout six o'clock the next morning,
Naked, swinging on the wind mill!
He said he flew up there.
I had to fly up there and bring him down,
He was about half crazy

The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds,
And put 'em in the sun to dry.
Then we mashed 'em up and chopped 'em up,
And put 'em in the corncob pipe.
Smokin' that wildwood flower got to be a habit,
We didn't see no harm.
We thought it was kind of handy,
Take a trip and never leave the farm!

All good things gotta come to an end,
And it's the same with the wildwood weed.
One day this feller from Washington came by,
And he spied it and turned white as a sheet.
Then they dug and they burned,
And they burned and they dug,
And they killed all our cute little weeds.
Then they drove away,
We just smiled and waved 
Sittin' there on that sack of seeds!

She had the strangest guest

She'd retire to her favorite chair
And sit there with a dog

I watched them drink their bubbly brew
Until the fire grew dim

There are times when I can fight it but now's the time I want to give in
Sooner or later we'll get around to love
But now's the time to shake it
Oh Baby let the party begin
Baby let the party begin

When I woke up this morning and I looked out my window
I could see the sky was cloudy and gray
There was a chill in the air and a pain in my heart
And the thunder it was coming my way

Oh, it was looking pretty bad and I was so alone
And there was any place to go
But now I'm out of the blue, I know what I got to do
And something in me's starting to grow
I can feel it in me starting to grow...grow...grow...grow...

I got dance in my pants
Every time I feel the power in a radio wave
I turn it up all the way
I got dance in my pants
Every time I see the glory of a good-looking face
Well I just got to say:""Hey now, don't you worry baby, everything'll be fine
We got nothing but the best and we got nothing but time
And there'll always be a time when they'll be waiting in line
To be dancing, dancing...""

Dancing, dancing
And now your body really knows how to speak, you're getting ready for

Girl:

We can rock it really hard or we can roll it really slow
We can lift it really high or we can dip it really low
We can hold it in tight or we can let it all out
Or we can work up a sweat and really stomp it and shout
Let me pull you so close and then we'll break away fast
We'll be the best on the floor we got the cool and the flash
We'll make a dangerous turn but we'll come out of it fine
I know the best of the moves we'll get them right every time

I'll crank it up all the way
They'll never get me to stop
I gotta stay in motion 'til the moment that I finally drop
When they decide that I'm gone
I know they're gonna try to put me to rest but I won't be afraid
Because I know, I know there's dance after death

Boy:

Oooh, I know there's dance after death
And I don't ever want to be rescued
I don't ever want to be saved

Jim Steinman,"[spoken]:
I remember everything!
I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender guitar
I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stradacaster
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel
I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stradacaster
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords
And the precise angle from which to strike
The guitar bled for about a week afterward
And the blood was ugh dark and rich, like wild berries
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterward, but it rung out beautifully
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before
So I took my guitar, and I smashed it against the wall
I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley Davidson
The Harley howled in pain, the guitar howled in heat
And I ran up the stairs to my parents' bedroom
Mummy and daddy were sleeping in the moonlight
Slowly I opened the door, creeping in the shadows
Right upto the foot of their bed
I raised the guitar high above my head
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down
 upon the centre of the bed, my father woke up, screaming ""Stop!""
""Wait a minute! Stop it boy! What do ya think you're doin'?
That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument!""
And I said: ""God dammit daddy!
You know I love you, but you got a hell of a lot to learn about rock an' roll""",Love and Death and an American Guitar,1981
Jim Steinman,"It's only two o'clock and the temperature's beginning to soar
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead
It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored
And breathing is just no fun anymore
Then I saw you like a summer dream
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
I saw you like a summer dream
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse
The subways are sizzling and the skin of the streets is gleaming with sweat
I've seen you sitting on the steps outside
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost
I think it's time for you to come inside
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget
I think it's time for you to come inside
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget

You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back
Come on, come on, it's time to burn up the fuse
You got nothing to do and even less to lose
You got nothing to do and even less to lose
So wander down to the ancient hallway, taking the stairs only one at a time

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

That we weren't alone.
She said she saw the ghost 
Of a woman staring at me.
I told her not to worry, 
But in the morning when I woke up, she was gone.

So I headed on to Florida where 
I tangled with some sailors.
And as I lay bloody on the wharf, 
I cursed the ship they sailed on.

And as he passed by he sang a hymn.

Well I almost joined him in that song
But instead I just held my peace, 
And waited 'till that old man moved along.

Then later on that day about 
A quarter mile out of town,
I found his body hanging in 
A grove of pines, swaying in the wind.
And as he swang that rope sang another hymn 
To Jesus,
And this time though I don't know why, 
I somehow felt inclined to sing along.

And there are projects for the living

I get confused by that distinction
And I just throw myself into the arms 
Of that which would betray me.

Will stoop down just to save me.

Wrapped in a red velvet curtain stolen from the movie theater where she works.

And watches as the flood waters spin him around once, then carry him away.

""What a coincidence."" he says

He wakes up one night six months down the line to find her staring at him in the oddest way.

""Oh nothing dear, except that tears are a stupid trick of God.""

Well hell, she's a thousand miles away.

Sweetly do I whisper your name
Lonely solo taxi ride to a cheap motel

On the wrong side of the tracks
The facts are tricky to explain
Cold front bearing down
Blowing in from Birmingham

Behind fourteen doors

Feeds the ache of ancient scars
Like ghosts beneath my bed rattling chains

Proved to soothe my sanity
Nor bad medicine served to ease my pain

As the sun goes down
I see a flatbed Ford with a scrapyard load
Rattle off through town

The railroad crossing lights flash on
There ain't no train in sight
A crescent moon will soon ascend
As day gives way to night

And I feel home
And I think how far away
I got from home
Back in the bad old days
But I'm done turning diamonds to coal

This old drunk comes knocking on my door
Say he's looking for some girl who lived here
Twenty-seven years ago

The radio in the kitchen is playing
'Papa Was A Rolling Stone'
And as he strolls away into the night
And the streetlights flicker on

I get to thinking about home
And how sometimes there come a day
When I try to get back home
But all you can do is run away
But I'm done turning diamonds to coal

In love we find out who we are
In sorrow we abide
Our strength's revealed by what we build
From the broken things inside

But a day will come when you will know
Which way you must choose to go
To travel on and live alone
Or turn yourself around and try to get back home
Try to get back home

And now way up high two jet planes
Weave spider webs across the sky
As that flatbed Ford has dropped his load
Now there he goes swinging by

And the silence gathering 'round this house
Makes such a lovely sound
That I know for sure that I am cured
From turning diamonds, from turning diamonds to coal

And though for ten years he's laid in that grave in Birmingham
To this day I still hear him saying what a useless thing I am

When I go climbing on my broken ladder
I'm searching for something but what I don't understand
Is how you can climb forever and still never reach nothing

Jim White,"That's how they found him
He was howling at the moon
He's sitting right there on the railway tracks
And the train was coming

There was a string of wild flowers
Draped around his collar
And when he saw the men were coming for him
Well, he began to holler

He cried, ""Take me away, take me away""
But the men could not be sure
If he was talking to them or talking to the oncoming train

Now his mama she watched religion on the TV
Each day from dawn to dusk
And at night when she'd hear him howling
Well, she'd cried to Jesus

For years she begged the Sweet Redeemer
To heal her crazy son
Until finally she just gave up on miracles
And called the men to come

She told them, ""Take him away, take my son away
'Cause after 20 long years
I've simply run out prayers to pray""

But as he stood to fight the men
From the other side of the railway bed
He thought he heard the calling voice
Of an old friend he thought long dead

But when he turned away from the men
He found it was a stranger calling him
And as if he knew that man
He smiled and raised his hand

As he stepped into the golden sun
Of the headlight of the oncoming train
And as he did he locked eyes with that stranger
He cried out one last time
He cried, ""Take me away, please, take me away""

And to this day in this little town
Not a soul knows what he was trying to say
All them years of shouting take me away
No, no one knows what he was trying to say
Or who that stranger was",Take Me Away,2007
Jim White,"The days of our innocence and grace flow by
The smiles we wear upon our face blow by

Oh, the sweet wine of youth

The more you ache to find

Like a bright-eyed smile
For some long lost friend
It's a town called Amen

Sit at the window sill
See the children rushing by
Come a flood of summer rain

How the wild engines run
Burning shadows from our minds

I sure pray what's left behind

Like the clouds above our heads

When you were a little child?
Will you lay in the arms of
Some sweet reverie a while?

Jim White,"Well I was shacked up down in Mobile 
With a girl from New York City.
She woke me up one night to tell me 
That we weren't alone.
She said she saw the ghost 
Of a woman staring at me.
I told her not to worry, 
But in the morning when I woke up, she was gone.

So I headed on to Florida where 
I tangled with some sailors.
And as I lay bloody on the wharf, 
I cursed the ship they sailed on.
Wouldn't you know, twenty four hours later 
That ship sank into the ocean
Disappearing like an unwanted memory 
Beneath the waves.

I guess it's 'cause, still waters run, 
Run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
Crazy way I'm swimming in still waters.

And I was woke up just before dawn 
By an old man crying in the rain.
He was drunk and he was lonely 
And as he passed by he sang a hymn.
And as I lay there listening, 
Well I almost joined him in that song
But instead I just held my peace, 
And waited 'till that old man moved along.

Then later on that day about 
A quarter mile out of town,
I found his body hanging in 
A grove of pines, swaying in the wind.
And as he swang that rope sang another hymn 
To Jesus,
And this time though I don't know why, 
I somehow felt inclined to sing along.

I guess it's cause, still waters run, 
Run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
crazy way I'm swimming in still waters.

Yes and there are projects for the dead 
And there are projects for the living
Thought I must confess sometimes 
I get confused by that distinction
And I just throw myself into the arms 
Of that which would betray me.
I guess to see how far Providence 
Will stoop down just to save me.

And it's all because, still waters run, 
Run deep in me
'Cause I've got this crazy way
Crazy way I'm swimming in still waters.",Still Waters,1997

Jim White,"Way down south I know a girl who is blind.
She walks alone along a lonely highway each day.
She dreams that one day a man will pull up in a car.
He'll open up the door, she'll climb in and he will say:
""Hey babe, whatcha know? Hope you're ready to go,
'Cause today's a perfect day to chase tornados.""
Yeah when the wild wind whips around your head you know, that you have found a perfect day to chase tornados.

And what about that preacher man on the run from the law?
He killed a girl in Memphis and ran 'till the dogs tracked him down.
They shot him by the river and as he lay dying in the mud,
Well someone asked him, hey Preacher, where's your soul going now?
And Preacher said, ""Well, I do not know, but wherever it is I'll gladly go... 
'Cause today's a perfect day to chase tornados.""
Yeah when the wild wind kicks around your head you know, that you have found a perfect day to chase tornados.

Sometimes I think that the sky is a prison and the earth is a grave.
And sometimes I feel like Jesus, in some Chinese opera.
And sometimes I'm glad I built my mansion from crazy little stones.
But sometimes I feel so goddamned trapped by everything that I know.
And I wish it wasn't so, cause the only thing that anyone should ever know
Is that today's a perfect day to chase tornados.

Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?

So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again

And I could eat, and I'd drink, and I'd run and I'd sleep,
And I wouldn't do nothin' except swim all day,
Except, ya know, my beeper doesn't work under water,

Where there are sharks!!

And there's this kind of anemone that sticks in your foot,
And the poisen goes up to your brain,
And you die!
And sand fleas!
Sand fleas!! yuck!!

But, actually I think it'd be really relaxing,
Just to be by myself, in the middle of the ocean,
And that's what I'd really love to do, more than anything else,
Except, I'd probably hate it.
I'm addicted to stress, that's the way that I get things done,
If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long,
And I hang around like a bum,
I think I'm goin' nowhere, and that makes me nervous.

JimBo Whaley,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Shoulda known, we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always want to be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Ohhh

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Un-huh

Jimetta Rose,"Happy's not a faucet that'll flow when a handle is turned
I wanna handle my shit, but it hasn't occurred
I need the stamina, keep on like my grandmama
When I'm not on camera I gotta be a man of my word
And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy
Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl
And made her cry, saying, see ya later, bye
Shit I say is pretty strange
Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
Fuck it, man, we're changing too, look at what we going through
Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into
But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape,
A great tsunami wave of cotton that I'm caught in
That she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome
But my style is sorta sloppy
I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy
The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley
And I don't really know why, no I don't really know why

All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is

So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out
But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route
But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse
I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out
It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out
And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in
She's all like, “come on Joplin, who the fuck invited him?!
Hide all of the Heinekens!"" No, they don't know my name
My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain
And Jimmy Morrison the doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones
Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game
I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster
Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain
They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze
And Kurt says, “How the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?”
I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey
But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka’s vertebrate (hey)
I guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success
Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest
This recklessness, no common senses
I Kamikaze, there's consequences
I don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it
I've been living for the moment gotta go (go!)

She was looking mighty tasty...she was looking so good to me
So I walked up to her with my very best smile on my face
She just kinda laughed and said ""are you through?
Can we get on, can we get on down to your place.""

She come up my stairs

She was walkin' on that same strip of road
And she was headin' my way
Now, I'll never forget the night before
In fact, I'll never forget that week
But there I sat, motionless, somber, silent, unable to speak
You see, to my sorrow, and to my shame
In all the excitement, I'd forgotten this girl's name

Jimi Hendrix,"Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Livin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell.

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,
Playing to the music that the drivers made.
People passing by they'd stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him ?someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
All kinds a people coming from miles around
To hear ya play ya guitar 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.

Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go

And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone

Loneliness is such a drag

So here I sit to face
That same old fire place
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time will tell,
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell

And I continue
To burn this old lamp
Lord, alone
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you?
So lonely
Gonna have to blow my mind

Not a friend on this earth can be found

And I told her I was in jail
She sent me back an answer
Sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
But I'm still walking round 
This old jail house this evening
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my body poor boy
And my woman is troubling my mind
Lord my daddy told me a pretty good people
And my momma she told me more
Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends 
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have done

Jimi Jamison,"You don't understand it

All of a sudden something's wrong

You take it for granted

All of a sudden time is gone



You put a little distance in between it

Hope it makes sense later on



You don't know what happened

Dreams never turn out like you planned

The next moment you wake up

Stranded in a one night stand



You put a little distance in between it

Until you seen it hope that later on



I know it's hard to wait that long

But right now baby

We both agree, something's wrong

Something's wrong



All of a sudden

May be weak and try again

But baby, baby, baby I don't know when

Until then



You put a little distance in between it

Until we seen it

Maybe later on



I know it's hard it seems so long

We both agree, oh baby

I know, I know.

Jimi Jamison,"People, look at us now 
In the midst of confusion 
We lost sight somehow 
How, in the name of the planet 
I just don't understand it 
Look at us now 

People, open your eyes 
How can everyone see it 
And yet be so blind? 
And still, still we go on pretending 
Nothing is wrong, we don't have that long 
Open your eyes 

Children, this is your song 
In case someday you need one 
Long after I'm gone 
Please take care of the planet 
Like the way that God planned it 
And pass it along 

Please, take care of the planet 
That's the way that God planned it 
Pass it along, to your children

Jimi Jamison,"Two worlds collide
Rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope
Against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up
Against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West
Or man against man
Can any nation stand alone

In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire

In the burning heart

In the warrious code
There's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries, never!
Deep in our soul
A quiet ember
Know it's you against you
It's the paradox
That drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire

In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire

In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"When he first knew this beauty
He brought no flowers
And she never asked him why
Although she shared his love of duty

He chased the wind in search of glory
She went beside him
Till he tried to reach the sky
Then she would wait to hear his story

And love was all that stayed between them
Music always played between them
Only gifts relate between them
But they could not see them for each other
Lovers for a sister and a brother

And then at last they found the real one
When she grew tired
He held her hand and made her strong
When a treasure is yours no need to steal one

And now the children are growing
She sometimes understands
The past can't last this long
The journey is worth the price of going

And love will always stay around them
Music always play around them
And the gifts that lay around them
Tokens of the lover and the friend
Telling them that they have caught the wind

And the wild wind dreams of directions it might blow

And a dream of sweet reflections from above.

As he cast a shadow, straight into stone

When babe like me, you were trying too hard to be free
Maybe now it's time for us to look where we have come
Though you think you're hiding form me
I'm not the one you're hiding from

And I'll run from you, oh, in the winter time
I know you'll need me when the snowflakes are flying
You'll want me by your side

I would wait for you, but my feet just keep on walking
And like a laughing stream my thoughts come quick, cool and clear
Something echoes now and then, but I don't hear
And on a winding road I'm well on my way with nothing to fear

And I'll run from you, oh, in the evening time
I know you'll need me when the moon is a burning
You'll want me by your side

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"It was a beautiful morning
On a hill where the wind only carried the sound
Of the mockingbird's song
And I was thinking about you

All the flowers were dancing
One by one they all told me of the time
That had been and the time that will be
And I was thinking about you

I walked on down by the river
Saw the sails on the ships that were leaving
For places I could only dream of
And I was thinking about you

The river ran to the ocean
I walked through the market and stared 
at the harbor lights
Through the soft rain
And I was thinking about you

I stood alone in the city
And the song I was singing was a cry in the night
For the morning to come
And I was thinking about you

I once build a mansion, then I tore that mansion down
I fixed up the penthouse, one day I burned it to the ground

I remember when she was everything, everything to me
When that hollow sun has finally fallen in the sea
Where you going, where you going, where you going to be

I've heard golden laughter glowing from the jailhouse walls
I have seen a garden growing where the rain don't fall
I would love to linger but I still hear the mountain call

If your cup is full, may it be again

Won't you hang my holy socks on a midnight line.

That river's gonna rush on by. 
But don't ask me to hang around 
I couldn't stay here if I tried
I'm your Ramblin' Man and I can go where I choose 
And if you sing me a song, Mama, make it a midnight blues.

Well don't that moon look beautiful, Baby, 
Climbing up through the sky? 
Well it looks like I'm gonna chase that moon
Mama, 'til the day I die 
I'm your Ramblin' Man and there ain't no doubt 
I'm gonna hang out late, Mama, with the midnight crowd

Where the silver starlight glistens 
On the green mossy banks of time
I'm gonna spend my long nights listening 
And looking for a star that's mine 
I'm your Ramblin' Man, and 'til I come home 
Won't you hang my midnight mail on a rolling stone

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor
I know I know you less and yet I need you more
I know I can't know what tomorrow holds in store
So I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor

It's easy for a man to let his memories down
Sometimes he just holds on by letting go
But when he's caught between what he has lost and found
He's the first to feel like he's the last to know

I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor
I know I know you less and yet I need you more
I know I can't know what tomorrow holds in store
So I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor

In ribbons and reflections I have seen your face
In secret songs I've sung I've seen my own
But face to face, these disappear with out a trace
And set me free to dance with you alone

I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor
I know I know you less and yet I need you more
I know I can't know what tomorrow holds in store
So I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor

I'll look for you tonight

Content to live the simpler kind of life.
My Grandma worked in the kitchen,
Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife.
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need,
Each mornin' they wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Here I am, ring on my finger:
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up.
I found my rock and I plan to keep her.
I wish they were here to see the two of us.
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

With the highway twice as wide,
And the farmland sub-divided.
It's good to know that some things never change.
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin',
By those simple words of wisdom:
Life an' love come down to just four things.

My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him,
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life.
And each day, I count my blessings,
To have that kind of love here by my side.
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:

Not one ribbon for her hair.

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

I will never, never know from where,

Jimmie F. Rodgers,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1991

Well it's a darn good life
And it's kinda funny
How the Lord made the bee
And the bee made the honey
And the honeybee lookin' for a home
And they called it honeycomb
And they roamed the world and they gathered all
Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And the honeycomb from a million trips
Made my baby's lips

Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone

When you got a wife like Honeycomb

And the Lord said now that I made a bee
I'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree
And He made a little tree and I guess you heard
Oh, then well he made a little bird
And they waited all around till the end of Spring
Gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing
And they put 'em all into one sweet tome

Gettin' love from here, love from there

And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be

There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over

When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that rises over the land

I watch you walk away
Somehow if have to let you go
Now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget

Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all

I send my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be

There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over

I got to thinkin' it over how much I had missed
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then, and then
Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged and I pleaded like a natural man

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well we worked very hard both me and my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life
We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin
And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well our children they numbered just about four
And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)

Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go
I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble and pain

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And why did I leave the plow in the field

They have an orchestra up in the trees

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Leaving me a song that will not die

The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

When stars are bright
You are in my arms
