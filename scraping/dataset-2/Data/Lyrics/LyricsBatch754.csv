MSG,"If you want paradise
If you can't make a choice
You're standing at the crossing of your life
Something's gotten hold of you
You can't think straight
What can you do?
Turn around and walk the other way

Life is full of mysteries
That come and go on the breeze
Oh! never changin' never changin'

We learn the golden rule
Spend our teenage lives in school
Takin' for granted day by day

Always something else to do
Distractions get the best of you
When you're young you think you know the way

There's preassures of another kind
Too frivilous, so never mind
Oh! never changin', never changin'
What is there to understand?
Someone always takes your hand
Oh! never changin', never changin'

You can find it anywhere, 
It's just a matter of time
Hey what you lookin' for 
Lookin' ain't no crime
Walk right up to the edge
Takt a look at life
Face to face with you
Staring at the truth
Gone with the wink of an eye
Disappeared, like the wind",Paradise,1992
MSG,"One thing I know.
Only get better
You only gotta keep it under control
And if you like it.
Just reach out and touch it
No one can stop you
'Cause your heart knows how to take it
How many times did you think.
You're goin crazy
Over and over till you nearly lost your mind
How many times in your life
Did it come easy
I tell you nothin'
'Cause nothin' don't come easy, easy!
Temptations hard to mike the right decisions
In this city where hearts are made of stone
Broken promises in love
I should have known it
They'll screw you over
If you don't know how lo beat it
How many limes have you heard,
I really love you
And you believe it, 'cause' you believe in love
How many times have you cried
When the doors were slammin'
Until your world was crashin' in
From up above
Oh! This broken heart
Oh! This broken heart
I'm breakin' from these emotions
I need lo mend this broken heart
I'm breakin' to find a brand new start

Keep movin' on, runnin' with the changes
You'll be much stronger
More than ever before
No one can break
Somethin' already broken
In little pieces, when the words
Are freshly spoken
How many times did you think
You knew the answers
To all the problems
That you had on your mind
How many times have you
Tried to turn your life around
Just keep on tryin' till you reach for more solid",This Broken Heart,1992
MSG,"Gina's got a six-string heartbeat
I could see the diamonds in her eyes
She would surrender on the back seat
All the way to paradise

One life, one crazy little moment
Nothin' else can take away the pain
Get ready for a night to remember
Love like this will never come again

Maybe she's cryin' alone in the night
No one will ever see the tears
As she walks into the light

Now she's gonna be someone.
It's her heart on the line for you
This night is gonna last forever
Promises were said and done
Can you really believe it's true

Gina's got a six-string heartbeat
No one else could ever be the same
She's feeling part of the music
Her one little piece of fame

One night, one crazy little moment
Taking everything that she can get
A souvenir of a lifetime
Somethin' that she can't forget

Sometimes when she's cryin' alone in the dark
She feels somethin'' inside
A little kick. a little spark",This Night Is Gonna Last Forever,1992
MSG,"It started with a smile.
With a touching glance
From right across the room
To start our new romance
Never said a word
But the air was full of talk
In next to no time.
We were laughin' at each other's jokes
You knew that I believed in you
Didn't know you'd scare that easy
lnstead of giving me a chance,
You shut me out completely
I believe the day will come
When our love will be one
And all that we once shared
'cause' we believe in Iove
Two hearts that trust in everything
For our love is indeed
The greatest love
(Cos' we believe in Iove)
You say YOU need my friendship
Do you know what friends are for?
We made love most every day
Is that the kind of friend
You're lookin' for?
Said you wonna be alone
That you ain't got time for love
But don'f forget who you're talkin' to
I was all of that above
Tell me what you're gonna do
When you wake up felling lonely
Will you pick up the phone and call me
And tell me you've changed your mind
I don't understand. 
I'm a lovin' man
Said I made you feel like nobody else
Can I love you more
Said I found your secret door
Like a thief in the night
You walked out of my life
If it takes a lifetime.
Girl, you know I'm gonna find you
I never would've thought
That you'd leave me behind you
It makes no difference
Who you're gonna see
There ain't no one in the world
Ever gonna replace me
Just you wait and see
We believe in love",We Believe in Love,1992
MSG,"Everyday I think about you
All the time crazy for you
Tell myself, again and again
I'll be patient but then

I feel you deep in my heart
Sell my soul for just one part
Could it be ooh! That easy
After all you've said to me

You broke my confidence
Took it all, why well you see
Makes no difference, to you it seems
What happens to me

Everyday I Wake without you
One more way to face - what is true
Life goes on, what else can I do
You're not here 'cause you don't need me

Never had to worry
Didn't need to care
Said you really loved me
But you're not there

Everyday when I think about you
Like a prayer to a child is new
In my thoughts you'll always be
The only one who could make me happy",What Happens to Me,1992
MSG,"It's early morning, not quite awake
The urge is calling and I can't wait
I need you now, Oh!
Your body moves, we feel like one
You open your eyes and I feel so strong
I want you now, more than ever

You laugh when I cry
I'm beginning to see the reason why
Don't go thinking I'll never leave
'Cause you won't be laughin'
You won't believe (You better believe)

When I'm gone baby, gone
Who's gonna hold you
From dark until dawn
And who will be there
That can love you like me
When I'm gone?

Your clothes are hanging on the floor
My room is full of the night before
And the promise you made to love me forever

Oh! You can't use me
Then just up and leave
You got it wrong
You better believe
If I walk out that door
It's forever
There's no turnin' back

When I'm gone baby, gone
Who will you turn to
When you need someone
Who will be there to love you
Do what I do
When I'm gone...",When I'm Gone,1992

You gave me rainbows and butterflies
We did enjoy our happiness?
When our love was over

There's no turning back
You said you loved me
And I did too
Now though it's over
I still love you

You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start

I tried to fight it
I tried so hard
And every day
I pray to god
That you and me were meant to be
But you had another
You had a lover

And now is gone
I don't know why
I feel like crying
Just want to die
I can't look at you
And you know why
No, I tried so hard

Like them other girls, who go giving it up,
Thinking what they got gon' get them hearts.

That you're out of their league.
But you should know, leave them boys with their toys.

But you're beautiful to me.
They don't make much of you darling,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,

Pack up your dreams and run, and run your way

Uh uh uh

And all the things that you feel
Are the same things that we all feel
They paralyze you then disappear, disappear, disappear
And all those things that you want
Are the same things I wanted once
You gotta have them at any cause
Or all this lost, all this lost

So I say
Hey, you gotta go, go ahead now
You got big dreams running through your head now
You run your way, you run your way

Is this the life you hungered for

The youthful ways of city nights
Could tempt you back without a fight

'Cause life is never enough
Gone is the boy
Who never said much

Tonight
There's always tonight
Where roads won't ever divide

We lock our lives out tight
And tell ourselves we'll be okay
But soon our trials will slip away
But times are turning back
The war has made it to our shores
The wolf is there outside the door

And life is getting too much
Oh for the heart
Its journeyed enough

There's always tonight
Where roads won't ever divide

And drown the memories you save

Beware my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

No mercy mild
And now I am forever exiled

She never gave a hint of discontent

Echoing their sweet refrain.

Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

MU330,"I heard the bells on Christmas day,
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

I thought how, as the time goes by,
The bells keep ringing day and night.
They rolled along, unbroken song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

And in despair I bowed my head,
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.""
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep,
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, goodwill to men.""

Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day.
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime:
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.

Tell me something I don't know

I know that it's bigger
I don't know about your neighbor
Please don't talk about your neighbor
I don't want to hear his name

He's built like a barrel
And his arms are large
And my arms are skinny
I really fear your neighbor

He probably owns a gun
But doesn't need it
He could squash me like a bug
And fix your car at the same time

I just lost you to your neighbor
But I don't think that he's your type
He's always there and he makes you cook
And you never cook

Hey now, hey now, what's going on with him?

Never paid too much attention to it,
Always thought that we'd both make it through it.
Just a feeling that we both couldn't do better,
Solid together.

Never fought, you never even raised your
Voice at me, we usually just agreed.
Holdin' hands, walkin' through the puddles,
How could things get so muddled?

You said this would probably make things easier,
Not at first, but eventually.
I just nodded my head and said O.K. let's try,
But it still doesn't make sense to me.

Where did you go last night? I hope you're makin'
New friends, how did you spend your weekend?

I'm doubting convictions.

Sometimes I don't know the difference between
Imagination and reality.
I just somehow thought that I was above
Suspicion and jealousy.

I'll sit back and watch this end.
How could you, said you never
Would go back on your word. Alright, again, you win again.

You laid me down, down to rest,
Stacking bricks upon my chest.
I felt my will slowly leave,
With each breath, harder to breathe.

These racks of clothes
Never looked so used up and old,
They never looked so used up and old.

Alright you win again, we're friends,
I'll sit back and watch this end.

Much the Same,"Life is more uncertain now
And I'm searching for tomorrow but I know My life is in your hands
Had my future laid out
The next few years all played out in my head
But I am just a man
Here I stand with no plans before me
So here I am, submitting full control
I can't stand not knowing what's before me
So here I am, playing my role
I'm not used to giving up control
Feeling I'm not living up to your standards
But I just want to obey
I can plan out day and night
Look at darkness or bathe in light, but what matters
Is that I walk in faith",Here I Am,2001
Much the Same,"Hello, it's me, your only son
Writing to you now because 
I haven't seen you in so long
Even though we live in the same home
You're the father that I've never known
I get up each day, you're already gone
Drive past your office late at night
And see the light still on
Why do you care more about your job
Than about the family falling apart?
Don't even know you
Can't understand you
Never stopped to think of anyone else

Hello, my boy, your letter hurt me so
18 years I've worked so hard, 
While I missed seeing you grow
I was just trying to provide for you
All my efforts thrown back in my face
Every morning I say a prayer for you
As I lose another day making it the best for you
Someday you'll wake up and you'll realize
And you'll thank me for how hard I tried
It's always been about you
But I'm a person too
I feel like giving up
I've had about enough
I gave up more for you 
Than you'll ever understand
But you were never there for me 
When life went bad
Son, I always tried to give you 
All the things I never had
But all I ever wanted was a dad",Father & Son,2003
Much the Same,"I have always been so proud 
Of my honest heart
So naturally the truth 
Flows from my mouth
Of course I have lied 
My share of times in my life
But it's pulling the teeth 
They pass to even spit them out

So it's so hard to find 
That I've been lying 
To myself all this time
I say I know you but 
It's time I realized
This life I lead is far 
From glorifying
Redundancy is plaguing me, 
It happens all the time

Because I just keep trying
And it's so dark in here 
And I need you near
To ease my growing fear
So now I know the truth that 
I've been missing all along
Or maybe just didn't want to hear
And I confess I'm a lifetime liar 
Of the truest kind
But I'm no longer blind",Liar,2003
Much the Same,"Well you're in control and I know it 
'Cause I'm miserable again
I don't understand how any of this 
Makes me a better man

You know I always run to you 
For some help with my life
You know I always come to you 
For a little wise advice

And all I get is pain
Okay, so I'm exaggerating,
I'm just saying that's how it seems to me
If all good things come to an end, 

Then what about the bad?
Am I cursed to never see the fruits 
Of the life I wish I had?
And can I try, one more time, 

To be pleasing to you?
My futile efforts never seem 
To make my wish come true
What can I do?

I'll follow through with all these claims 
I never cease to make
A promise to myself 
Is one I promise to break

But when I have you by my side 
Then I can do what's right
I'll become the co-pilot 
And you control this flight

Then everything will be alright
This song's for me
A reminder of how I intend my life to be
Every word I sing

Is an anthem against my own hypocrisy?
Let me be free",Wish,2003

It's all about
The phat and perfect family
We make 'em jazzy
And make 'em parlez all the way
The kind of flows
That shake the hottest towns
We make the hottest sounds
And make the parties bounce

Joe&Phlowtron:
It's the infamous freak
And venomous Jizzow
We hold on
With Supafreak and AtomdaBomb
From Phlowtron
This how we do(this is how we do)
Yo,you best listen proper
On a Phat fam trip
With more kicks
Than foot locker
Your boots been rocking
Keeping it up in this mother
Your style's fake
Like it get sarcasm
Every time you knock her
It's urgent for us to be
Submerging from the underworld
We the chosen ones
You don't believe me
Ask the oracle
Read the chironicles of this
Mad rapper slash whoever
Yo we fam?
Yeah we fam
And keep it
Through this endeavour
This mission we ain't preaching
Just need to split some knowledge
Time to put fake noise
Wise in cold storage
We beyond
It's your time
You think you Hispanic
We think you charlatanic
Just chilling don't panic
Ain't no beef in this brother
The styles remain unheard of
Too Phat and Phlowtron
We taking this further

Repeat chorus[2x]

Malique & Phlowtron:
Yo what's your name(Malique)
And what you representing
Too Phat
I heard a lot of songs
The filling you now
I'd say now it's too bad
It's poetry of myself
And those cast that filling me
Like all your fans
No doubt
What you seem to hear
Squealing me
The stress is killing me
But remain the trendsetter
Like when push comes
To hold ups jeans
You should know better
A 13th letter song
She never yawn
To remind you of my name
Every time you be counting
One,two
No question
I got some assumption
Now an era of submission
On this repercussion
I superscript patch on
Equipped and all ready
Then everybody best believe
That you fly
Like I was R.Kelly
Yeah,I think this someâ??really
It's revolutionary
When we blow up spots
You know my style unheard of
It's Phat Fam
Representing on the slow song
Malique locking the down with me

Carleed from Phlowtron

Repeat Chorus[2x]

Muchachaz:
Norrenâ??I rock steady
My raps are not petty
My texts are locked fatty
Yo Ren your shots ready?
Oh yeah I'm ready
Step back and make way for Renita
One in the million stunner
I'm the femme de Nikita
1,2 Dahlia's coming for you
The dance queen,facinating
I'll be rocking the scene
Fantastic causes
Phat Family no pauses
We're pushing courses

M.O.B:
Ohhhh nooooâ?¦(No,No,No)
You better be ready for now
Coz MOB's coming for ya
Holla at me
If you wanna battle(battle)

As I running into the club
Give it up just stop
Don't think you're on top
Gotta be the one
Who's making it pop
Telling you a bit about
That's how we roll

Gotta stick to the plan
Caught a chick do that thang
Better keep to my slang
Got a gig to be hang
Rather be with my friends
Got you sick when I sang
Would you stick to my fang
Bet you flip I say so

Better be prepared
With a red carpet
Gotta move my steps
Taking off your hat
Show me some respect
Doing as I said
Everything's the fact
Flip that and so we roll

the Tarik Crew:
Save the best for last
Coming through
The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines
That we be quoting
Exploding
We leave the venue
With the stage broken
That no sugar coating
Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow
The rhyming prose
With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

Muchachito Bombo Infierno,"Fuí a la orilla del río
Y vi que estabas muy sola
Vi que te habías dormido
Vi que crecían amapolas
En lo alto de tu pecho
Tu pecho hecho en la gloria
Yo me fui ""pa"" ti derecho 
Y así entraste en mi memoria
Tu me vestiste los ojos
Yo te quitaba la ropa
Todas las palomas que cojo

Vuelan a la pata coja
Tu ibas abriendo las alas
Yo iba cerrando la boca
Tu eras flor desarropada 
Y yo el calorro que te arropa
Tu perfume es el veneno
Que contamina el aire que tu pelo corta
Que me corta hasta el habla y el entendimiento
Porque es la droga que vuelve mi cabeza loca
Después me quedo dormido
En una cama más dura que una roca

Soñando que aún no te has ido
Soñando que aún me tocas
Y el sol se va sonrojando 
Porque la noche le va cayendo
Los pájaros van llegando
Los árboles tienen sueño
Sus hojas ya se han cansado 
De aguantar tanto el invierno
Y yo sigo aquí a tu lado 

Hasta que me lleve el viento
De luto se pone el cielo 
Que viene con nubes negras
Será porque tiene celos 
De que esta noche te tenga
Que oscuro que se esta haciendo
Echale leña a la hoguera
La hoguera del sentimiento 
Que arde si estoy a tu vera",Tu Calorro,2009
Muchachos Del Norte,"All my life I've been in love with you,
now you are here, I can't believe it's true.
I must be dreaming
when you say that you're in love with me.

In my dreams I've kissed your lips of wine,
now all at once I find you're really mine.
I must be dreaming
when you say that you're in love with me.

The way that I feel
is so heavenly, too good to be real.
When you're next to me I'm so afraid
that I'm fast asleep so don't wake me up,
let me dream if I'm dreaming.

Oh my love, each time I hold your hand,
everything is just the way I planned.
I must be dreaming

Take my girl dating at the drive-in,
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 
I'm gonna buy her pretty presents,
Just like the ones in the catalog.
Gonna show her how much I lover her 
Let her know that one way or the other,
Our love's gonna be written down in history 
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 
Right now I'm speculating,
Wonder what to morrow's gonna really bring.
If I don't find work tomorrow
It's gonna be heartaches and sorrow,
Our love's gonna be destroyed by a tragedy
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 
Talk about love and romance,
Just wait till I get myself straight.
I'm gonna put Romeo's fame right smack dab outta date.

On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid.
Little White Dove was her name.
Such a lovely sight to see.

So their love could never be.

With a love that wouldn't die.

Cause the river was too wide.
He couldn't reach his Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side.
In the moonlight he could see her
Blowing kisses across the waves.
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her brave.

Through the swirling stream they came.

Mudcrutch,"An orphan of the storm
She moved to Houston
To live below
That copper colored sky
Louisiana girl
Born into losing
The skyline of the city
Made her cry

[Chorus]
So Lord send me down
A fallen angel
With a miracle to perform
And I ain't the kind
Who gives up
But I'm so tired of rain
Lord I'm just an
Orphan of the storm

She'd lived there before
When she was using
Now she's standing on
The same old street again
Yeah that hurricane
It blew her back to Houston
Had to give into
The devil's howling wind

[Chorus]

Now somewhere down the line
There must be salvation
She thought it through
20 years ago
But sin spoke
A constant invitation
It was in her veins
And wouldn't let her go

Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here, 
Right here I want to tell you a little story.
This is about a country boy from down home.
This young man has never been north before.
I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell
You.

He heard about Chicago.
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800
Dollars.
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in
Chicago, 
And he said, ""Cousin, I'm on my way"".
He picked all of that cotton.
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B.
King you know.
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and
Bring him out to the club.
He said, ""Set him up!"", cous's payin' for.
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up.
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the
Pleasure hotels.
They brought him back out and said, ""Set him up!"", 
Cous's payin' for.
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from
The Lute and brought him down to Robert's.
And then he said, ""Set him up!"", cous's payin' for.
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man
Had ever had, began to run out.
Then they moved him out and put him down with the... 
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would
Get fewer.
His friends was fewer.
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other
Side of the street.
And then it happened all his buddies were gone.
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting
Cold there, like it is today, 
You know what I'm talking about.
He went down to the railroad yard, 
And one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent
His money, came by to see him.
And she said ""You fool!, you fool!"", I wouldn't have
Spend your money, but the rest of them was spending
Your money so I decided to spend my portion too, you
Know.
But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't
They?.
They always like to feel like they're needed, and she
Knew my man needed her bad.
He gotten sick, he's layin' down there under the
Boxcar.
Couldn't read so well, so you know if he couldn't read
So well, he couldn't write too well, 
You know what I'm talkin' about?
So this is a letter back down home, I know what I'm
Talkin' about.

I've had my fun, whoah, if I don't get well no more
Whoah, I've had my fun, people, ooh, if I don't get
Well no more

In

Mudi,"Gedanken in schwarzweiß, keine Farben
Alles düster, Stimmen flüstern, Gesichter halb verschwommen
Halb sichtbar, die Vergangenheit zum Greifen nah
Doch die Gegenwart machte aus mir ein TV-star
Scheiß auf gestern, blick' nach vorne wie ein Adler
Trete in die großen Fußstapfen meines Vaters
Nie wollte er, dass wir auf unserm Weg gekrochen gehen
Brust raus kannst du dieses Feuer in meinen Augen sehen?
Deutschraps Tatlises, Arabeskrap
Liebeslieder-king, hab' ein Fundament gesetzt
Neider sagen: Er nervt langsam rum mit seiner Schnulzenmucke
Halt die Schnauze, bevor ich andre Töne spucke!
Frag mal rum, Bruder, glaub mir, ich kann anders
Leonidas, weißt du, wie viel Kraft so ein Punch hat?
Eure Worte sind für mich nicht mehr als Platzpatronen
Nicht mit mir Bruder, geh mal jemand andrem drohen!

Profitieren vom Tod andrer Menschen Waffenproduktion
Ich schreib's dir auf, meine Gedanken in schwarzweiß
Fick die Menschheit! Bewegen uns auf Glatteis
Produzieren, um zu töten
Menschen schaffen Monster, alles nur für Öl und Moneten
Alles ist wie früher, nichts hat sich verändert
Politiker können reden, doch im Endeffekt nur Blender
Alles ist wie früher, Geld regiert die Welt
Der Mensch wie ein Computer, er vernichtet sich bald selbst
Erschaffen einen Virus, aber ohne sein Gegenmittel
Vergiftete Lebensmittel, sterben im Elendviertel 
Keine Farben, alles schwarzweiß und düster
Lila Scheine machen eure dunklen Seelen nicht bunter
Ich werd' krank von Sachen, die ich weiß
Zu viel gesehen, Gedanken in schwarzweiß

Ich seh' die Menschheit, Kinder, Hoffnungen brechen
Ihre Gesichter sind finster, seh' niemanden lächeln
Sogar ein Blinder sieht das Leiden der Menschen
Sie haben das Lieben vergessen, wo ist die Reue, verdammt?
Doch Iblīs hat das Gute in ihrem Herzen verbrannt
Hat ihre Seelen verbannt und sie in Ketten gelegt
Sie sehen 'ne andere Welt, sehen nicht die Realität
Sie sind geblendet Reichtum und Macht
Fick die Politik! Ihr habt diese Welt so gemacht
Und deswegen dieser Hass, der Hass, der in mir steckt
Keiner, der die Träumer weckt, diese Welt, sie verreckt
Und das Einzige, was stärkt, ist der Glaube an Gott
Egal, wie stark der Schmerz ist, ich hebe meinen Kopf
Wie lange lebe ich noch in dieser Welt voll mit Lügnern?
Jeder will was ändern, doch alles ist wie früher

Und du dich fragst, wo Gott ist, denk dran
Der Lehrer ist während einer Prüfung immer leise
Sabr ist, wenn es im Herzen schmerzt, aber du trotzdem weiterkämpfst
Sabr bedeutet nicht, wie lange du es aushältst zu warten
Sondern wie du dich verhältst, während du wartest
Wann auch immer dich Kummer
Unruhe oder Probleme aufsuchen
Schließ deine Augen und sag dir selbst
Auch das wird inşallah vergehen!
Sabr ist mehr als Geduld
Sabr ist die Art, wie du bei einer Erschwernis handelst
Während du wartest, dass diese vorbeigeht
Sabr ist, wenn du deine Situation akzeptierst
Sabr ist die Stärke deiner Seele
Sabr lehrt dich nicht zusammenzubrechen, wenn du das Gefühl danach hast

Und nach jeder schlechten Phase folgt eine gute

Wenn ich leide, ist sie da sie stillt die Schmerzen
Und sie fragen schon wieder „Was kannst du ihr bieten?“

Und im Haushalt hilft sie ihrer Mama!
Meine Tochter ist gebildet Abitur und Studium
Was kannst du ihr bieten? Du hängst jeden Tag im Studio rum!
Nennst dich Rapper, bist von Frauen umgeben
Was hast du erreicht, außer Fans, in deinem Leben?
Was kannst du ihr bieten? Wer bezahlt den Haushalt?
Sie sitzt allein, während du dich draußen rumtreibst
Meine Tochter verdient einen echten Mann
Einer, der studiert hat, einer, der was bieten kann
Einer, der sie schätzt und es weiß, sie zu lieben
Ich frage dich, was kannst du ihr bieten?“

Mein Ein und Alles ich würd' mein Leben für sie geben!
Was kann ich ihr bieten? Ein reines Herz aus Gold
Einen treuen, loyalen Mann mit Stolz
Ich hab' meine Prinzipien, doch weiß es, sie zu schätzen
Weiß es, sie zu lieben, und weiß um sie zu kämpfen
Weiß, was ich zu tun hab', ich kenne meine Pflichten
Vertraue dieser Frau blind, sie lässt mich niemals sitzen
Genauso lass' ich sie nie im Stich, es gibt nur sie und mich
Die Meinung andrer Leute über uns interessiert mich nicht
Soll sich einer trauen, meiner Frau zu nah zu kommen
Ich kämpfe bis auf's Blut für sie, bis zum letzten Gong

Und will ihr jemand ein Haar krümmen, wird's blutig enden

War der Tag an deiner ersten Diagnose
Kam nachhause von der Schule, ich ahnte nichts
Sah die Tränen im Gesicht, du umarmtest mich
„Pass gut auf deine Schwestern auf
Und ist dein Vater nicht daheim, bist du der Mann im Haus
Vergiss nie, was ich dir beibrachte
Deine Erziehung, auf dich und die Familie achtest
Kümmert euch um euren Vater, wenn er dann mal alt wird
Lasst nicht zu, dass er andre Frauen heiratet

Weil ich weiß, keine außer mir macht ihn doch glücklich“

In my life, I'm so alone

Hypnotizing the ignorant a little boy's best friend's always his mother,
At least that's what she said,
Life of a simple man,
Taught that everyone else is dirty,
And their love is meaningless,
I'm just a soiled dirty boy,
I'm just a soiled dirty boy,

Sheltered life innocence,
Insulated memories, spark reflections of my head,
Duality in my consciousness,
Caught in the war of hemispheres,
Between the love lost in my head,
Mommy do you still live inside of me,
I'm so lost in my life without any guiding,
Protected me my whole life from everything,
Nailed shut the doors to the shrine,
To screen your dead eyes from me and my sickness,
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading,
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face,

Deliver the remains from her womb of earth,
Prep the rack and tie up for new love's rebirth,
Covert understanding of novice surgery,
I'll focus concentration and only take just what I need
For sickness I'm masticating,
Dancing and masturbating,
Celebrate in fields of night with skin upon my face

If I soak my hands in others blood am I sick,
If I wash my hands in others blood am I sick,
If I drench myself in others blood am I sick,
If I bathe myself in others blood

Blame mother for the sickness,
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading,
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face,
Dance and masturbate in night light by myself

Got to just be
You've got to just know

I hope that when you find this
I've left you with a happy ending...

Feeling so sorry
Selfish and sore
Wish I wasn't born
Piece by piece I can carry it all
Strength to be driven
So unforgiving anything is possible
Like leaving you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small

Step by step I'm pushing through this
(All of you get away from me)
Eye for an eye I'm pushing through this
My law
Step by step I'm pushing through this

Tooth for a tooth I'm pushing through this

Cut through a conscience I've failed to explore
The calm before the storm
Speak your peace and prepare for the fall

Tainting the gift
Lying truth's so incredible
So fuck you all

Can't seem to get away
No one knows
No one except for me
Paranoid
I can't stop looking over my shoulder
Stalking me, chasing me
Am I lost inside a dream

Life consumed with fear
Small silhouettes approaching
Chasing through this mystery

Listening
The deafening noise of silence
No ones there
Always just the two of me
Turning
I can't stand with my back towards the Door
Halting me, following
Lost in my own memory

Life consumed with fear
Small silhouettes approaching
Chasing through this mystery
Shadow is drawing near
Am I being taught a lesson
By my own lifes history

Feel us watching
Voices are speaking to me
Pictures following
And they sit there pointing

I can't see, I can't fight, I can't leave, It won't die
Its become part of me

I can't run, I can't hide, I can't run, it Won't die
Its always been a part of my life

Guilt is stabbing downward
Guilt inside is killing me

In the court of the law
With let niggas that feel ya
They know cat dealers
But with some new shit, like clue shit
We strap for this thriller
You hit the crack house, you pull a mack out
Cock the mack back, blow his back out
And take the back route
And that's what that's about
Understand? I wan't cans in hand
This shit is real, never phony
Don't come short with my mo-ney
I'll only tell you once tony
""don't fuck me, don't you ever try to fuck me""
If so, trust me, you outta luck be	
And try to sit high where them drugs be
Filthy rich looking broke
Fuck a bitch I wan't the world thust
Keeping feds of my ass
I gotta think fast
'cause black man white town you know this shit won't last
We try to bumble like ass
Stay low, got to hurl that cash
Into the trouble blow past, that's how you do it

[Chorus:]
We got cops and robbers
Niggas and spicks
Flashy cars, ghetto stars
Moving stones and bricks
It ain't over on the streets
We got blocks to get
So heads up, guns cock
Don't get rocked to this

-{lord tariq}-
Now if the good die young
Then what the fuck that makes me?
And who the fuck are you to rape me?
Less then the best, bulletproof love
The thugs holding it down in the decks
And for the frauds I got techs
Heading straight for your chest
Feel me on this
My word is priceless
You can't pawn this
I might diss drop jewels
The way I cop jewels
The way my nine drops flues
The way my mind influes
What's a nigga to do a murder
Type of shit you never heard of
From jimbos to fat burger
On some last long shit
I be doing this forever like that nigga von zeil
Plus I calm shit, I bomb shit
I had a lot of brooklyn niggas
Saying ""yeah them bronx niggas they get down""
So hold your heat up, and move fast
You got to keep
Because clue, minnesota, lord tariq run these streets what
Nigga peep up, talking to the sidewalk
And there's nothing to comprehend
When my nine talks

I peep the devil screaming bk
'cause I rock for b.i.g.
Live like pop did, shells couldn't stop the kid
In some rap I pack, used to be in passing for crack
Molka type of lid with a passing for stacks
Dreads call me african black named after my medicine
Street veteran with one gun
Killed eleven men
It's too crazy, why'all fake tough guys with full gazi's
Blue mercedes, three pounds under the blue avy
Bomb crews my mind power beyond you
Now I push your hair line back
Do what the con do
I warned you, and sworn no talking
Bring the thing out
Got the block surrounded like cops
And shots rang out
Animal instinct, blood type is therobreed
Run with thero heads
Leave you in another burough bed
Respect my hood, like the heats do
Be k to the bronx
Poor kane, lord tariq & clue

You think you could hold three, nigga hea go six
I bring heat like Deniro flix, my team lock and load
And rock and roll like Aerosmith

Fuck cops I got Cochran Shapiro chips
One point five in ice in each earlobe shit
Fuck who you and your man go get
Me and cat take pussy's on boat rides on some Soprano shit

Move wit troops in cougar coupes
Like beeno and notes for a G a piece, they'll remove your roof
Ya better spread when the ruger shoot
Paul Cane got fire, everything ya heard on Clue was the truth

It's like who want what what ever
Yo and your man play tough ya gon' get plucked together
At gun point gettin stuck together
Black Benz tinted out, buggy headlights stuck together

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust
Lady Luck, Paul Cane, who could bang wit us

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust

They said I rap like a man and act like a man
So when it come to war she gon' clap like a man
Short arrogant wit this gat up in my hand
Chicks don't play cute I'm still attractin' your man, come on

Rock many lands, Japan to Philly sands
Luck stay ghetto like Rican dolla bands
Only thing I take serious is garments and money
And late periods, there she is

Screamin in a two by two, too fly two seater
Too much ice, too cold, two heaters
Love men but got lesbian guns
That love to lick off at you pussies for fun

So play dumb in these dum dups, hit you where you pump cum
Stick you for your lump sums, we the ones you run from
Till the day my lungs done for blocks
I hit hard like Ronnie Lotts, lady Luck got it locked

Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous

Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous
Cock back aim and bust

Ya talkin' greasy like Paul ain't a nigga wit fire
Like I ain't got guns or killers for hire
Got wolves that'll run through mask and arms
Like point break clear the safe out and smash your moms

Over 40 years old still blastin' chrome
Smiles never cross they face till there's cash in palm
'Cause they still do murders for bucks
Have 'em put hollow points through you then pass the burner to luck

We like a two G Bonnie and Clyde, back to back in beef
Wit two heats a piece, mami gon' ryde
Spit four, she behind me wit five
You know Paul Cane and Lady Luck MO catch homo's and slide

Before we drop the guns
Wipe off the prints, push the pedal through the floor
And get away back to the bricks, ya don't want nothin' wit us
Paul Cane, Street Life, Desert Storm, we're dangerous

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us
Got a lot of hungry niggas that came wit us, we're dangerous

I examine your diameter, third eye, light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister

Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break, I can't revive

In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four
Five clip, filled with the spiral tip

I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggaz approach me

Like the blind, death, dumb, whose mind was left numb
A non be Boy nigga couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started MC'ing, I entered the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I becoming with too much to measure

With the math of an elder and the steel of a welder
The path of tray that I had laid down and held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope

Supreme deluxe edition, cream with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison

Twenty-two year old, Dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby, moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body now, he stuck in another prison

When you see it, you better acknowledge your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours, pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw

Why try to fuck with these lecturers?
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. family and more one

I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land

He blew out the belt drive, MC's they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation

But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn

Them, Clansmen are the nucleus of hiphop
There's no room for error, M see's will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser

The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone

The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces and driven back

It is very dangerous to make a raid
With the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack",Advance Pawns,2005

'Cause he's so far from freeing the world that seem strange

I come from a place where they say death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block dance to a different tune
Every night and every day hotels of foul play
Turns fatal when this hostile land of AK's

On any date not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder, it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew but he was moving at a snail's pace

Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position

The mission was to move in with sheer brute force
And lives they get lost on a collision course
The streets are fascinating so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors

Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth but can't hide the evidence

A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45 but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime

Aiyo, pop, pop, pop, pop, when it shots, whose to blame?

The story had a familiar ring of truth
But it needed a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere the bomb was gift wrapped

The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close

A bundle burglary with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray

Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals right from the start
That'll rip out your heart and consume the fattest part

Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant he was so far from free

Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast

Muggs,"Two individuals pulled from a lake
Inside a vehicle, one had his foot on the break
The windows was fully up and the doors was locked
The news made the headline and the town was shocked

The driver was clutching a can of Hi see
His jacket was tied to a near by tree
His jeans had dye in them and an usual tattoo
Was the only hope to identifying them

The autopsies revealed gun shot wounds
Dental records matched to a newly wed groom
This accident was a cover up for homicide
Two, who might have stayed alive from paying bribes

Sheets investigators had relied on the media for help
And to track down the perpetrators
They canvassed the neighborhood with standard procedure
And visited the home of a topless skeezer

Who was at the bar when he was last seen alive
Left with him just ten minutes after they arrived
Despite the police efforts they turned up nothing
Just an ex hooker tryna get a rep from bluffing

But the wide publicity had just paid off
From a hard rock inmate who was just made soft
He said he knew a man who killed the pop star
And almost got caught by a passing cop car

The inmate said probably the motive was robbery
And knowing if he keeping it a secret, it bothers me
He said this individual killed for low billings
And purchased a murder kit blocks from the killing

The sheriff's office had no time to waste
Plus the inmate never deal to avoid the case
So he cooperated fully and snitched on his chop shop mechanic
Who used to move bodies on the pulley

An extortionist involved in similar incidents
Payments that came in thousand dollar increments
Suspicious activities that flooded the place
So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls were traced

The hair that was taken from his car interior
Was that of a young girl who felt inferior
She died fighting and probably aroused his anger
Holding off her life as she faced the strangler

The crime seemed to be sexual from nature
It was substantial evidence that the nigga raped her
The suspects had marks on his face and chest
But it just wasn't enough to get an arrest

Asked of his whereabouts on the third of July
Said he partied with his friends and had a solid alibi

The championship ring fending, they must be dreaming

Make them hire law enforcements
Plus, I just turned down tracks, can't remember the
Producer with the beats is wack, sound similar

Writing, light stroke from my pen might choke
The tape lent, got a little air, then half the spins

The nature in the scale of events, shook the station

And my hand take hold on judgment
I will take vengeance upon my enemies
And I will repay those that hazed me

Sub woofers pumpin' all throughout the place
A fake rap nigga tryna plead his case

About to start shit that'll attract the flies
And then you hear lies followed by some cries
It's about to be a catastrophe

Half of these rap lyrics ain't thoughts prevoked
Just alotta beef 'til they get caught in smoke
But the problem is never cured, on top of that
Most of them be swingin' wild and then drop the bat
Many curious spectators watch the human drama
This rap cat was all in the street without his armor

A homicidal attempt that had failed
He flew off the roof, on the fence, got impaled
He talked a good one but it was make believe
Much too low for the human ear to perceive
He confused science fiction with science facts
He couldn't separate the block from the recorded tracks

What some talk about had little or no bearing
Could the next be some real shit that's far from comparing
Materialistic M.C.'s come off boring
Meanwhile, I be sketching up, deposit drawings

Through the years, a countless number of victories
Changing the era we swarm unpredictably
A rhyme book is not difficult to manage
I leave a mic in a bandage from catastrophic damage

Rap niggaz on a trip, gotta steal your sandwich
So I creeped, division reports was left on canvas
I made it through the worst extremes of cold weather
Scuffed up but remained durable as old leather

An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially bears
Was a role model, like a Cardinal to our peers

A patriotic tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a dolphin
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore bangles
Drove a Bronco and she was far from Star Spangled

Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, 'cause she was behind them bills
Had a man who always roared like lion
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying

Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a ""Ten I See"", you just need to tighten your game

Her ancestors were chiefs, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the Seahawks, who battled the buccaneers
The redskin garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners

They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at cowboys and 49ers
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
A great force grip, but out of bounds for a musical

She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started Texan her, soon as my plane had touch down
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the Jaguar

Her brown skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a raven
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her

There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were vikings
Militant as panthers, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the charger

I introduced myself to gain yardage
Cause anything less then smooth, would of been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, steelers and panty raiders

She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would of been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line

Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was 'bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to packer, as she stroked my helmet

And I was thinking these girls was saints
But it was first and ten and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a colt, before I released them puddles

They spread eagles like wide receivers
As I ram them in the end zone, and they became true believers

I be liking chess
Cause chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess

As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,2000
Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2013
Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do

Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Muggsy Spanier's Ragtime Band,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2013

Just come on home
Oh... make things work
I need you here
I'm scared of being alone
Ooh

I'est reaching this far
And I don't want to go there
Remember...

Ooohhheeeooo

Baby let's go dancing
Like we talked about
I'll do the strange kind
If you can shout

Look at my wee boy
He's one of a kind
He makes me laugh and he
He makes me cry

This kind of love is hard to find

I want you
And guess what?
I've shaved off my beard

And I need you here
You know I could be that boy that you...

Baby let's go dancing
Like we talked about
I'll be the wheel boy
If you can shout

Look at my wee boy
He's one of a kind
He makes me laugh and he
He makes me cry

Baby let's go dancing
Like we talked about
I'll be the weird boy
And you can shout",I Want You,2005

To the woods,to the birds, to the mud,
To the bricks over the curves, 
To the forced bizarre got with 4 acres 
And force with words,
Planted chrome for the young seeds to know, trees is blowing
We see change in the wind
This is new day and I gotta take it in, see a black man hero
We need him to win
Young eyes search search for a better tomorrow,
Let the belief lead the way and the angles halo,
Open doors for a hope for to go through,
Cause I would chose see and I'm supposed to.

[Chorus: x2]
I know that change come come
The race begun, we're almost there oh yeah

I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child, I always smile,
Let my mind float like child.
Wishing I was smart as these kids are now,
All grown ups still wishing I'm a child again.
Church saw remind me to stay grateful,a more ? remind me to stay playful,
Day's go by,my life all high
I leave all my walks so the fight don't die,and me
I found the purpose why I'm MC
Inspire a young world to be greated than me.
I fall awake and a dream a song,
So the little shorty's could sing along.

[Chorus: x2]

Welcome children, welcome me
Your sentimences felt in me,
I see the future and the walk your path,don't let these fools take you off your path.
Laugh if you need to,smile if you need to,
Life is a trip while a long and proceed to,
Try to believe to, do what you wanna do, remember you kings and queens are still humble to,
Life is a bitch now need to look back again,
Victory can be claim while you still battling,
Drive along with the food I provided you,
To awaking the boy's that is inside you.
