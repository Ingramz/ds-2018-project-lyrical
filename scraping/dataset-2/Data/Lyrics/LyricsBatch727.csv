Mick Lloyd,"Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack.
I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.
Hot dog, I feel lucky tonight.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky.
Think I'll flip a coin I'm a winner either way.
Mmmmm I feel lucky today

Mick Lloyd,"Spent forty-eight dollars last  night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in to deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it","I Like It, I Love It",1997

Mick Lloyd,"Have you ever been down to Texas
Down around San Antone
They love to go all night and treat you right
And party till the cows come home
 
I love it when the let their hair down
And dance real close to you
You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do

They ain't no different up in Oklahoma
They ain't afraid to stay up til dawn
They love to cut a run and chug a lug

You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do

Gonna take 'em out, take 'em one by one

She'll put a bullet in your heart

She walks like she's walking on water
She moves like the boss's daughter
She rides like a '67 Chevy
And a drive-top red, white and gold

Oh, what she does to me
With her long dark hair
And her sexy thighs
Baby let me come inside

'Cause she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With the devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
And she's hell on heels

I was raised by the devil's own kin
Told me that a good time was never a sin

At lunch brings me the drinks that she prepares

I am just another guy she brought inside of her
Add summer soul for her desire

Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm

All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Mick Mulligan,"Sweet young thing of sixteen
Thought I'd step out one night
I longed to get the thrilling life I've missed
I met a youth 
A bit uncouth
Although he seemed alright
I knew him by the moment when we kissed

Then I got home, next day with a swollen head
My girlfriend asked if I'd had fun I said,
""Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
Did I get a thrill?
Am I full of quiver?
Was he rough?
Did I care?
Am I glad I fell?
Every time I think of him do I shiver?
Was he hot?
And was I?
And would he stand for maybe?
He would not?
Did I lie?
Does he still think I'm a baby?
If I was, am I still?
Do I care?
Don't be silly
Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?

Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
With his hands loose as no refusin'
Did he fight?
Was I blue?
Almost shamed to tell
And I don't know yet the system he was usin'

Well I said, stop, please, behave!
Well what's the use of breathin'?
He said, give
So I gave
After all, what was I savin'?
Am I glad?
Holy gee, 
Have I had fun, you're askin' me?
Was I drunk?
Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?""",Was I Drunk?,2002

Will there come a time when sorrow's hard to find
And all those nursery rhymes will find a meaning
There's got to be a change, thoughts to rearrange
Does it seem so strange to try redeeming

Only time will show if the unrelenting blow
That's cast from down below does strike the ceiling
Life must still go on whatever's right or wrong
Realise what's gone and was never healing

In my pocket only cents and dimes
But then for them he'd gladly kill me

Up, washing the sleep away
My mind, full of the games you play all the time

I, roll up a cigarette
Sit down, trying hard to forget
Your face, when you turned and left me again

It's not a game
Seeing your face on the wall, when it's only in a frame
It's not the same
Sleeping without you at night, not knowing if I will again

Ours is terrestrial love

Keeps reflecting visions of your face

You aint nuthin - go away
Youre just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed
Im gonna be somebody - someday

When she started dating boys - I nearly died
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand
I felt I had to crawl away and hide
In my mothers living room I composed so many tunes
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say
Gonna be somebody - someday

Wild as your name I soon left that country town
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud
Its that face in the crowd - didnt dig it - much too proud...

When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream
A barker street bus station non affair
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad

Most everyday of your life
Oh learn to get wise, you learn to compromise-
You learn to criticise yourself
I guess we all grow up 'cause one day everything-
Seems so further from the truth
And you try to find yourself- in this endless youth
I said you try to find yourself-and you
Beg a little love

Fate takes another stab at your face
And you can never cease to resist
And you take it on the chin-that old sucker punch again
Reminds you what you've missed
When the colors blazed and your jealousy raged
You were so sensitive to every touch
And it ain't to forget in this endless youth
So you find a perfect stranger- and you
Beg a little love

What do you get in the end
Did you really need that friend
Your emotions dulled to save your heart
From failing at the hardest part
But you still get down on your knees
I said you get down n your knees
And you beg

Now there's nothing left to laugh at
Nothing left to say-nothing left do
There's nothing left-so there's nothing left to ask for
But you still get down on your knees- and you beg

Burnin' a hole down my heart
Dancin' down that river of no return
You know you missed that boat- but you still get
Down on your knees

Afterall o' those fears
Afterall o' those dreams
Afterall o' those screams
Aferall o' those nights

Called him agitator, spy and thief
Shut him up in solitary third degree

And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda  beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group

There's  blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed

Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one

No pain, no joy, no power too great

To turn to mold

Looks like too much traffic on the road
No fun in driving
You wait in line forever just to go

Sitting in your prisons on the road

Everybody's rushing
Is it so important to be so
Where's it going to lead to
If all the rushing leads to moving slow
Heavy roar of engines
Sitting in your prisons on the road

Poison from your engine
Merges with the air we've got to breathe
Look at that congestion
Don't it make you want to pack and leave

Sitting in your prisons on the road

Don'tcare that we stand and see
As we pass by their bars to the next attraction
The horses the birds in their cages
Such a shame thay can't be free
Like me and my children

So happy in the times that we ride in the day
And at night there's always a meal and a show
And then we go to the point where we say
Farewell to remember
When I go my love stays

Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

I knocked on the pearly gates
Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through
I smiled, threw my hands in the air
Laughed and got arrested
They said hey man, you're in the wrong place
Your behaviour is a disgrace
Here we pray every hour, on the hour
Read extracts from the Bible and look solemn'
What, says I, no party?
No party?
Let me out

Let me out of Heaven
I got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Let me out, I just can't stay here

Well I ran around in the state of shock and panic
This wan't what I expected
Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me
If you want to go to Hell you've really got to be bad
Okay, okay, I'll be bad
Too late
What do you mean too late
Too late
No
In the meantime

Let me out of Heaven
I've got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Oh God, it's awful here
Going crazy in Heaven
Take me out and let me go to hell
No laughing in Heaven
Don't laugh, this place is Hell",No Laughing in Heaven,1981
Mick Underwood,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [Live],1981
Mickaël,"[Chorus]
Can you handle my love (You better kick rocks)
I'm sick of your lies (You better kick rocks)
Sick about your issues (You better kick rocks)
You ran out of time (You better kick, rocks)
You can't handle my love (You better kick rocks)
I'm sick of your lies (You better kick rocks)
I'm so down with your issues (You better kick rocks)
You ran out of time (You better kick, rocks)

You think you're so damn cold, you could play me at your game
While you wasting my time, girl, you so lame
Maybe you misunderstood, that's the way it go
Sayanora, adios, we finito
New number, new phone, new contact
All your pictures, I deleted all that
New whip, new clothes, new condo
You better break white and gold, kid, pronto

[Chorus]

That means bounce, dip, grab your (shit) and get out
Cause I ain't even tryin' to hear another word out your mouth
I'm remixin', changin' your position
And no more fightin', no fussin', no more friction
Your shopping addiction, tossed out the window
This is my house, I guess you stayin' with your kinfolk
Cause you outclassed, I need you out fast
Used to be about me, now you all about trash
Baby, please don't harass, or even tryin' to stock me
I got restraining orders, baby, come and get your copy
Your game is so sloppy, messy, girl, when you text me
I don't even read it, I delete it so sexy
Ha ha
And I know it don't sound right
But you can't turn a (hoe) into a housewife
And I know it don't sound right
But you can't turn a (hoe) to a housewife

I can run a flow
She shot me with the bow

Yeah, let's go!

Dança comigo, wow

Não sai do meu pensamento
Poesia em movimento
She uses her body like no one I've ever seen
Hot as hell this girl's on fire
Missmorizing with desire
Quando o seu corpo se move, é puro fogo
É puro fogo

And give it to me slow
Cupid got the air bow
She shot me with a bow
And all I see is her

Spinning in position,
Show me what I'm missin'
Moving across the floor
Where she's gonna miss me
Hipnotysing, missmorizing
She is the best thing, but now be dying

Look at the way she pops her body
Outta control, out on the floor
Man I swear this girl's on fire
Look at the dance, look at the move
Look at the way she pops her body
Outta control, out on the floor
Man I swear this girl's on fire let's go

Mickael Carreira,"Cada vez que estoy cerca de ti
Pero no digo nada
Es por que sigue estando siempre ahí
Quien roba tu mirada

Y puedo verte sonreír
Duele ver que no es a mí
Sabes que aunque siento que te amo
Lo escondo en mis latidos

Y que le ruego a un sueño equivocado
Te haga soñar conmigo
Sabes desde que te vi
No dejo de pensar en ti

Es mi corazón que no es normal
Sólo quiero estar contigo
Aunque no pueda y me haga mal

Es algo sobrenatural
Te quiero hasta el infinito
Aunque estés con alguien más
Pero yo puedo esperar
Sabes que daría todo
Por robar tus labios
Llenaría el mundo de caminos
Siempre hacia tu lado

Sabes desde que te vi
No dejo de pensar en ti

Es mi corazón que no es normal
Sólo quiero estar contigo
Aunque no pueda y me haga mal

Surround you with my long limbs

In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams

Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree

Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong

And I'll be by your side forever

Droop so hungry neath the sky.

Jewels polished and gleaming.
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein,
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming.
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll,
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow,
Five men writing with fingers of gold,
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale,
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion

Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below.",The Eleven,1968

Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you",Tin Roof Blues,1998

Mickey Avalon,"I stroll down the Ave like big Johnny Rogers
I pull tricks for a fix and tonight 
I got flows for hos with low self esteem and,
More for those swallow protein.
The kid from the 60s stars in skin flicks and,
Pays the rent inch after inch,
But now I get fly with lyrics
While you guys be on some queer shit.

Check out the way I take a mark for all that he's got and a whole lot more
Cause when your drawers hit your ankles
I untake the shank out my sock and take the bank roll.
Oh shit you just got lit by an illegitimate kid out the orphanage run and shit.

I'm cumin with styles you can't handle smoother 
Than the velvet that was hanging from my mantle.
So light a candle and praise yo' Lord
Mickey Avalon's some shit you can afford.

If you want to party
Get my number and call me
From dawn to dusk I bust nuts and shoot Charlie
When you got some money then come and get yo' jollies
A Quarantine in this California dream
All up on the scene dipped in Vaseline
My foster parents told me that I could be
Anything I wanted to so I became me
Mickey Avalon the kid who runs free
Serving sucker mcs and getting paid for my delivery

Howlin' like a banshee and
Even when I'm wearin' panties I stay manly

Tipsy off scotch whiskey,
Sniffin' blow through hundred dollar bills.
I toast mimosas from coast to coast,
In penthouse suits
With out any clothes.
I used to stroll to avid holes in my shoes
But now I fly first class and
Bask in sun tanning booths.
Hustling gay dude for Quaalude's,
Out by the pool,
In a baby blue bathing suit.
Waiting for Jesus to bring the juice.
I was paying dues while you was playing in school.
I took the whole scene over with the flow from my lips.

Mickey Avalon,"All my friends and all my lovers are...dead
Some from cheap narcotics and others from...lead
The filthy rich and the dirt-dirt poor
Are all the same when they can't take no more
'Cause all my friends and all my lovers are...dead

A slit wrist leaves a mess
On the breakfast table, oh yes
Betta' cut deep 'fore you go to sleep
But in the morning you're the one who gonna have to clean

Days I've seen make a priest lose his beliefs
Like Kathy crawlin' 'cross the carpet in the bloodstained briefs
Chewin' pills like she was starvin' for a taste of relief
Her last wind was in the trash can; couldn't beat the disease

All my friends and all my lovers are...dead
Some from cheap narcotics and others from...lead
The filthy rich and the dirt-dirt poor
Are all the same when they can't take no more
'Cause all my friends and all my lovers are...dead

Johnny made a record, went straight to number one
But Johnny had a little fascination with guns
And cocaine, he couldn't stand to take the slow train
Got a little fortune, lost his breaks in the rain, ooo
What to do when your luck is through
Whether you come from the slums or live in Malibu
Seen runnin' down the avenue
Mickey Avalon with an attitude

Seen him knock a man clean out his corduroy slippers
And that same man's queen (?) monster truck and hit him
Found him lifeless as a log in the Mississippi river

Mickey Avalon,"The road to the top, through crossguards and hard knocks
Copper penny times and endless city blocks
Thieves straight as they never been crooked rent-a-cops
Shooting craps in the back of vacant city lots
Free-range circus acts and worthless facts
Dancing in my solar soggy bowl of dick and smack
Fist-fucking faggots at the White on gym mats
Rats run the wire while I'm looking for a match
I go back and forth just like a cameo song
Honeys wanna love me but the line is too long
I make 'em take a number
Wake 'em from their slumber
What you know about Mickey? 
(He's a bad motherfucker)
Truckers get my digits off the stalls of rest stops
I'm sick on the microphone like smallpox
Wild-eyed babies go crazy when I rock
Blind old ladies into diabetic shock

It's all the same when they call my name
Mickey Avalon, hustler hall of fame
There ain't no ball and chain, to hold me down

I flow like an acrobat, go tell your manager
That Mickey Avalon ain't no motherfuckin' amateur
I fly flicks with my dick at your camera
I rip the stick out my girl's Porsche Carrera
I brought your whole formula, just warmin' up
Storm the frontline and then I find a spot for lunch
Toxic-proof punch when the loot comes
Rocket boosters with my boots on
Underneath the tundra reach out for the Thundercats
Holds no better than this brother act
I ripped the rubber mats out your lover's pad
And kicked your mother's ass right in front of your dad
Last night, a brass pipe and a flashlight
Smashed my crown and left me down with a black eye
The bad guy, walking over landmines, who can't die but still cried

And it's all the same when they call my name
Mickey Avalon, hustler hall of fame
There ain't no ball and chain, to hold me down

Leave your gods and your politics back at home
'Cause I just wanna drink and be left alone
I gotta girl who likes to talk my ear off, see
So when I'm at the bar stay away from me
Don't ask for a smoke or to make some change
I don't care about your kid or your menstrual pains
You can call me rude but I like my solitude
And we don't need to chat while we're playing pool
So stay cool mister, I wasn't lookin' at your sister
That snaggletoothed sea hag, lips all blistered
Now rack the balls while I'm in the stall
Pissin' out vodka and walkin' up the walls
I turn off the ringer when my lady calls
Don't point your finger unless you want a brawl
I chalk up my cue and sink the eight ball
Then reach into my pocket and light a Pall Mall

Mickey Avalon,"I had a baby named Jane
She could shake that thing
Said her Daddy used to hang
With Johnny Coltrane
She sang a soul train
With her friend named Jen
Her booty was bigger than a Mercedes Benz
Jen was a herdy-gerdy-dirty little girly
I heard it from a birdy
She could cook a mean turkey
With gravy, baby, baby, baby
Baby was Jen's best friend, and maybe
If you were lucky
Licky, licky, sucky, sucky
Mickey, Mickey, fuck me, fuck me
More junk in the trunk than a Honda
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your booty on the dance floor
Work it out, shake it, little mama
Let me see you do the Jane Fonda
Five, six, seven now
If you don't know, let me show you how
To work it out; work it, little mama
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

I had a princess, queen of incest
She was in bred Jean had big breasts?
And big eyes and a big ass to match
Jean wasn't fast, she was easy to catch
Then came Molly Hood from Hollywood highs
So fly she was Trans-Atlantic
She was a manic depressive (manic depressive)
Which was impressive
Very impressive, I had to test it
Tasted like chicken and was lemon scented
She took me home to her mama
I taught them both how to Jane Fonda

[Chorus]

I had a girl named Dana 
From Santa Anna
She was a waitress at the Copa Cabana
She was slammin', and her ass was jammin'
Like Janet Jackson in Rhythm Nation
Her brother Jason had a girl named Grace
You could see her ass from outer space
So I landed on a planet
And planted a Mickey A flag, dammit

Mickey Avalon,"Who that dude sleepin' with ya girlfriend
Gettin' nude and rude in your bed
Same dude that your sister like
Mickey Avalon, call me Mr. Right
Who that man in the black Sedan
With two cheap hookers and a Mexican
Pumpin' white lines, sippin' warm Coors Light
Mickey Avalon, call me Mr. Right

Stab on the ave, on the back of green grass
Young teen on the scene, no future, no past
I don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' so don't ask nothin'
Cause I only be talkin' out my ass

Somethin' smells fishy and I don't know what
But I got a hunch it's your lady
I'm little bit country and a little bit punk
I got a pistol named Sunny that whistles when he's rubbed
The wrong way, Mickey Avalon song playing
Strippers so strip's up, entrees for Dante Alighieri
I seen a better day
Wine, and cheese, fine ladies, and lemonade
Gettin' paid for rhymes like these
And I never even learned to say my ABC's
With ADD I rock the beat
Like AC/DC, deeds done cheep

Who that dude sleepin' with ya girlfriend
Gettin' nude and rude in your bed

Pumpin' white lines, sippin' warm Coors Light

From K-Rock in L.A. to rooftops in Haiti
Hey baby, he's Mr. Wrong
And maybe you should listen to the words in this song
Bird on a wire, your skirt's on fire
Now please take a moment to admire my attire
Fresh white valleys and pink tube socks
Tight gray Levi's and shirts with polka dots
Rolex watch but it's fake
Gold gazelle glasses and a platinum chain
But it's fake, like your tits
And your eyes, and your nose, and your lips, and your braids
The glitz in LA got me ready to play
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day
Every night on the Strip I slip and slide
I'm that guy, call me Mr. Right

Who that dude sleepin' with ya girlfriend
Gettin' nude and rude in your bed
Same dude that your sister like

With two cheap hookers and a Mexican

She used to make me dinner when the winters were long
Liza packed a pistol and a train to St. John
Along Lincoln Continental took a boat near and far

We used to count stars while Mary tended bar
Liza's long term lover Mary buried her last broad
Stuck her twice quick with an ice pick
Workin' on the night shift then took flight, in light so bright it

Hurt her eyes so she cursed the skies
Gripping her purse tight bursting through the night
With her hands washed clean off the murder scene
She moved to New York City, hung with hookers and fiends

Then one night she met Liza in the bar that she worked
Serving appetizers in a buttoned down shirt
They got along together liked high heels and short skirts
So Mary packed her bags and she became Liza's bird
Then I saw less 'n' less of Liza and the last that I heard of her
Mary murdered her

Jesse moved to Hollywood to take his great chance
With a dream in his heart and a blade in his pants
Jesse waited tables in the fancy place at Robinson
When David Harses's daughter strutted in and spotted him
She said, ""Hey, little cutie, you're a beauty follow me?""

And took him to all the best parties in the city
Introduced to the new producers on the scene
He did all he could to get his face on the screen
Jesse learned how to slouch with his ass on the casting couch
And took it like a champ when they passed him around

He read script after script and sucked a whole lotta dick
But the only films that Jesse ever made were Jacko flicks
So one night he took the blade that he got from his pops
Dragged it across his throat and left a note in the mailbox

And shiny black stilettos and a red leather bag
Heidi took the dough up front and went south
She would pick your pocket with your dick in her mouth

Then count her loot and go shoot some coke
She was cute as a button, sweeter than a muffin
But Heidi slit your throat if you didn't pay her for her lovin'

Me and Heidi first met on Vine and Sunset
She was pourin' sweat out the corvette
She looked at me and cringed said, ?Hey, you over there
If you've got the syringe follow me and I'll share?
We went back to my room and used my harpoon
Noddin' off on the couch watchin' cartoons

And when the sun went down she said, I'll see ya around?

Keepin' the place tidy for some high payin' fool

Mickey Avalon,"For next to nothin'
Your soul could be mine
Now that I got your attention, look you dead in the eyes
If you're gonna make a move, let it be quick
Because the last mother fucker stuttered and got clipped
I stick and move like a dog in the night
Who proud but won't growl before I'm gun' bite
Street lamps light the way as I stray
Past the corner liquor store and the penny arcade
Juiced on bennys and hard lemonade
I boost so many sweets I've got tooth decay
Who say, that Mickey can't rock your life
I've been up for 2 days straight
And 3 nights
I wear my lee's tight
And tapered at the bottom
I bought them at the swap meet in Spanish Harlem
So if you got a problem
You know where I'm at
Lurkin' in the garden with snakes and gutter rats

With eyes on the back of my head after dark
I'm just a lone drifter on the lookout for a mark
I've got angles that'll tangle masterminds with heart
Fuck it I'll even run a bum for his shopping cart
When I was young my father, rest in peace
Taught me how to pick a pocket and copy car keys
As a little boy I'd hop through chimneys
Skilled at the art of making enemies
So if you got beef
Better have good luck because
Even if you knock me down, I'll get up
And if you don't kill me
I'm gonna slice your gut
With a straight edge razor
Riddled with rust
Blood lust takes me over when I close my eyes
And look back over these jet black skies
My time here may be short along
So when I rhyme here I'm gonna light this on

At the end of the eve we
Roll up our sleeves
Mess with my stake and I'm gonna have to swing
So don't make nothin' more difficult

And you have the nerve to step on my chucks fuck that
I wasn't brought up to turn the other cheek
I'll break your mothers back, just for touchin' me
I crush MC's with line step line they're mute
Strangalin' triangles, spheres, and cubes
The day old leader throwin' jabs and slabs
Of meat, that hang on hooks and straight stink
Go play the clubs that love to dance
Where chumps step bump me as they walk on past
Avalon don't care none for breasts
Less they cook and clean and wipe my ass

At the end of the eve we

With hookers and hotel rooms and cocaine

Life's been a haze since I flunked fourth grade
'Cause I couldn't keep my nose away from spray paint

For my burn faster overcooks my steak

Ready to murder fools when she comes home late

When she screams like a psycho and hangs up the phone

But now her other lover's sendin' me death threats

I sky scrape the heavens in just a sledge can
Psycho killer kids just say ""Bam ba bam bam""

Struttin' down Hollywood with the Friday night loot
Pass skinny speed freaks and hussy DQ's
Many lookin' trannies wearin' high heel boots
Talkin' to house broke husbands in three-piece-suits

It's freezing cold and my jeans got holes
I ain't seen my baby since I sold my soul
In the Vienna streets, got my feet all swollen
I can't walk, so, I crawl 'cross the floor for more

Now hold that thought and lock the door
I got six in the clip and a box in the drawer
For a spoon, I'll sing you a tune
And dance like a banshee underneath the moon

I'll pick up clues like Nancy Drew
And if you ain't her, get out, flew the coup
Off to a place where the brothers got grace
And punks don't lie straight to your face, yo

Romeo had Juliet
(Yeah)
But give me three sweeties in a new Corvette
(Woo)
When it's time to strut and cut off strings
(Yeah, what?)

Mickey Avalon,"I like a girl with caked up makeup
In the sunshine smoking cigarettes to pass the time
Who wakes up to a bottle of wine
On the nightstand bites and scratches the blinds

But I ain't found one quite right yet
So I step with pep to the park or supermarket
Her apartment best be messy
And Lisa don't mind when I call her Leslie she's gotta dress with class

In Jean Paul Gaultier and a Hermes bag and four inch tips made of ostrich
Sharp enough to slit your wrists her lips spread gossip
Won't say sorry when she offends
She comes over to my place in her old mans benz

And gold and silver and jewels of all colors
And she doesn't take them off when we're tearing up the covers

Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in the whole damn city
So rich, so pretty...

I like a girl who eats and brings it up
A sassy little frassy with bulimia
Her best friend's a plastic surgeon
And when her beamer's in the shop she rolls the benz

Manis and pedis on Sundays and Wednesdays
Money from mommy lovely in Versace costly sprees its on at barneys
And I love to watch her go through fifty g's calmly
She gets naughty with her pilates body and thinks it's really funny when her nose goes bloody

Because the blow is so yummy and it keeps her tummy
Empty and makes her act more friendly dance the night away
And she won't say nothing when she makes your man stray

Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in the whole damn city

Come on and get it before I change my mind
Come on kid don't waste my time
So rich, so pretty
The best piece of ass in the whole damn city

I've had you come before Mickey
Go get my purse Mickey
Lock the door Mickey
You're just a midnight snack

Shhhh don't talk back
You're just a boy Mickey
You're just a toy Mickey

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
That God must be one sick motherfucker

Spend another day waiting to die

I came twice this shit as any German sheisse the flick
I'll sperm on your perm, leave cigarette burns on your tits
It's Mickey Avalon all up in your prom
Pissing in the fruit punch with a baby blue tuxedo on

The dopest is rapper this century
I sodomized your father in a federal penitentiary
And on the day I got out
I went to your mother's house and slept on the couch

A street walker selling cock for rock
At the flea market trying to hock my watch
I stay on beat when I work the concrete
Some honeys give me money, and others do my laundry

Mickey Avalon the kosher salami
For twenty you get Chachi for forty he gets you Fonzie

But then I got fired when my mom logged on
I'm on the run, my dad's a bum
I asked my girl if she loved me and she just said 'ummm'

I bust flows that turn nuns to hos
So wake you from your slumber then shake you out ya clothes
There aren't no other late night lover
All up on the track like Scatman Crothers

I'll bust through the shudders, masked in a rubber
Duct tape your mother and butt-rape your brother
Break down the lumber and shake my cucumber
When you're at home alone you know my phone number

Close her eyes and open her mouth

So what do I do when there aint none left
Make a call to the pony express

Tryin to look all fresh

At the town at the touch on my mother fuckin' mind.

On the greyhound bus caddy on my mind
Sun shine heroin and whine
And you wonder why your lady keep my telephone line
Ringing all the time
Can't you read the sign
Long haired hippies they need not apply

With the police man keep flashin' them lights

I can see me and you together

Rub her face, rippin' up the lace 
Panties to the side as I slide into place 
Smile on her face, tears in her eyes

I got a daughter at home, her name on my neck 
I don't need another baby in my life just yet 
I got 99 problems, and your girlfriend's one 
I'm crazy in love with my sawed-off shotgun 
Hand on the pump, bust a window at the pawn shop 
Reach right in and got blood on my Rolex 
Take me home and lick my wounds, let me crawl back in the womb 
Click, clack, boom, comin' out of the tomb 
Dead man walkin', singin' out of tune

Cooler than a pack of coors

Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Aches to dissapate the fright

Speeds past his machine, but
What ever happened to the teenage dream?

From a musky world
Sweetly mouth touched
Him on its spur
His prison guards
Were very hard to clean, but
What ever happened to the teenage dream?
Do it, do it, do it to me babe
Do it to me babe, aha!
What ever happened to the teenage dream?

And the bums and thieves
Ruled my girl
With tuetonic teeth
But all was lost
When her mouth turned green
What ever happened to the teenage dream?

And the ragged kid
Are all sad and rusted
Ah, they don't have a gift

And some get it night

In the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget him now
In a glass of sherry wine
Lights that offer other girls
For empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright
And it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights
 (turn around)
The world was dark
God made the stars
To brighten up the night
But the God who put those stars above
I don't believe He made those lights
It's just a place for me to cry
When things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide
Behind those city lights
Lights that say forget her love
In a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing
But a masquerade for tears
They paint a pretty picture
But my arms can't hold 'em tight
And I just can't say that I love you
To a street of city lights
No, I just can't say that I love you
To a street of city lights",City Lights,1976

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

It thrills the fairest lady of the land

The orchid that I overlooked was you. 
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid that I find my dear was you.

And now I pay the price with bitter tears.

Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine.

When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now the time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you dear forever by my side.

Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurting of before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll be loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will.

It's just knowing that I know you'll never be mine
And the dreams that always keeps on hurting me in my sleep

Shining steel reflects a future wife
Who waits ready, eyes steady as night

There was a wealthy merchant,
In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter,
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor,
Her true love e'er could be
Oh her true love e'er could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, to convey herself away.

""Before you step on board, sir,
Your name I'd like to know""
She smiled all in her countenance,
""They call me Jackaroe""
Oh, they call me Jackaroe.

""Your waist is light and slender,
Your fingers are neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball""
Oh, to face the cannon-ball.

""I know my waist is slender,
My fingers neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall""
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.

The war soon being over,
They hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found.

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds.

This couple they got married
And well they did agree
This couple they got married,
So why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me.

My blood and perspiration oil the gears of your machine""

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they gunned you down""

Said, ""bullets are like waves, they only rearrange the sand

""Have you written anything I might have never heard?""

I heard a laugh I recognized come rolling from the earth
I saw it rise into the skies like lightning giving birth
It sounded like Garcia but I couldn't see the face
Just the beard and the glasses and a smile on empty space

Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O.
Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O, will you marry me pretty Peggy-O

If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free
And free all the ladies in the area-O.
I would marry you sweet William-O, I would marry you sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few 

And I fear my mama would be angry-O.
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O,
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O,
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink

Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers.
If ever I return pretty Peggy-O, if ever I return pretty Peggy-O 
If ever I return your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O.

Come steppin' down the stairs pretty Peggy-O,
Come steppin' down the stairs pretty Peggy-O,
Come steppin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair 
Bid a last farewell to your William-O.

Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O.

Faint light of the morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care 'cause it's alright

I will get by I will get by
I will get by I will survive

I see you've got your fist out say your piece and get out
Yes I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way the only there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

It's a lesson to me the eagles and the beggars and the seas
The ABC's we all must face try to keep a little grace

It's a lesson to me the deltas and the east and the freeze
The ABC's we all think of and try to win a little love

I know the rent is in arrears the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow's giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

The shoe is on the hand that fits, there's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright

Mickey Hart,"Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.",When Push Comes to Shove [Studio Rehearsal],2013
Mickey Hart,"Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, and shake their bones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink, yeah
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own. On our own. On our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Sing ashes to ashes, all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

It's dizzying, the possibilities

If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks - God knows and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, cleanse my hand
My strength comes as natural as any other man

You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever had lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he walked up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaw
He ripped that beast, killed it dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head","Samson and Delilah [Live at Providence Civic Center, Providence, RI 5/1",2015

Mickey Newbury,"And then those funny, familiar, forgotten feelings
Started walkin' all over my mind

Last night, quietly, she walked through my mind
As I lay searching for sleep

Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name
As she brushed a tear from my cheek

And then those funny, familiar, forgotten feelings
Started walkin' all over my mind

Well, now I must go on, be strong
Though million teardrops may fall

Before those funny, familiar, forgotten feelings
Stop walkin' all over my mind

Mickey Newbury,"Here comes the rain, baby
Guess it's goodbye again, baby
For a while it was fun we could walk in the sun
But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?

See the rain in my eyes, baby
I never could stand goodbyes, baby
For a while you were mine but the sun can't always shine
And you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?

Here comes the rain, baby
Guess it's goodbye again, baby

But you never could stand the rain, could you, baby?

 Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
 Old things they are not forgotten
 Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
 Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
 In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie

Mickey Newbury,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1977
Mickey Newbury,"I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
(I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two)
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous

Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
(I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret",Driftwood on the River,2004

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

""battle of metal"". However, they wanted to challenge them once again. This test
Was called the ""battle of steel"". In order to aid them in their holy quest it
Was decided to bestow unto them four magic utensils.

So the gods called upon the old dwarf and the mighty wizard and told them what
They sought. The dwarf took the sword Nothung, once belonging to ""Siegfried
The dragon-slayer"", fused and smithed from it's steel four shakels of metal.
The wizard created the same number of amulets from the skin of a black demon.
He then took the silver shaded blood of a dead unicorn from which he drew four
Magic runes, each drenched with natural power.

The power and strength of a bear would be given to the bearer of the hammer
""giants death"", the speed of a hunting hawk to the bearer of the bow ""heart
Hunter"", the brutality of a lone wolf to the bearer of the axe skullcrusher,
And the deafening roar of a black lion to the bearer of the sword souleater.
Then the dwarf mounted the shakels of metal on the amulets whilst reciting
Ancient words of magic power. Thereafter the amulets were presented to the
Dragon lords, who brought them to midgard, home of the thunder warriors. They
Received this gift and a mighty power flushed through their veins. It was the
Power of magic-the magic of steel.

Suddenly thunder rocked the silence, lightning crushed the roof of the hall,
And the two mightiest gods of Valhalla -Thor and Odin- stood on the stage. The
God of thunder held his hammer on high. Odin wailed his spear into the
Audience. Any wimp present knew now that death was imminent. They disappeared
As quickly as they came.

In the blink of an eye the thunder warriors conquered the stage: Once again they
Would ride side by side with their legion of doom, under the sign of the
Wizard, to their next test- the ""battle of steel""... So they fought with the
Power of metal and again were victorious. They devoured the hearts and spilled
The blood of their enemies. Their weapons found the hearts of all decievers and
Liers, crushing their bodies to the ground. After the ""battle of steel"" was
Over the ground was covered by a sea of blood. From that day on the four
Thunder warriors knew that they were forever bound by metal.",Main Title [From Babes on Broadway],1995

Mickey Thomas,"I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
Ah, but when the, the grass got a little greener over on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

Free, on my own is the way I used to be
Ah, but since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me
It's got a hold on me now
I can't let go of you baby

I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, oh yes I did
I fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fooled around,
Fooled around, fooled around, fell in love
Fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fooled around,
Fooled around, fooled around, fell in love

I fell in love, I fell in love, yes I did",Fooled Around and Fell in Love,2006

We don't call the shots here 
We don't make the rules 
We take what we get, get what we can 
And it's learning the hard way 
Here on the streets 
You can't build a dream, without a plan

(Play for keeps) They play to win, we play for keeps

It's not over 'til it's over 
It's not over 'til we get it right 

The odds are against us 
They say we don't stand a chance 
But there's no giving up, no giving in 
When push comes to shove 
You got to fight for what you love 
You do what you must, do what you can

Whatsoever 
I was gone for a night 
Nothing's forever 
The cruel daylight 
Brought me back to my senses (Back to my senses) 
Got caught in here 
Under false pretenses 

No way out 
None whatever 
I made up the story 
Thought it was clever 
She didn't ask 
And I got no reply (Got no reply) 
But later that night 
I heard her cry

No way out she doesn't buy my story 
No way out she doesn't buy my story 
No way out she doesn't buy my story

But can she forget 
Nothing's forever 
Since yesterday 
She's a little bit colder (Little bit colder) 
Won't happen again 
What could I've told her 

No way out she doesn't buy my story 
No way out she doesn't buy my story 
No way out she doesn't buy my story 
No way out she doesn't buy my story 
Doesn't buy my story 

How can she tell the truth from the lies 
When does she know when to close her eyes 
She doesn't want to lose me 
So she only sees what she wants to see

Move on, it's no good to go back in time

I'll never find another girl like you, for happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice, the dream won't come true

Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger in the game when the stakes are high
Branded, my heart was branded while my senses stood by

Winter feels so gloomy

We built this city on rock and roll, built this city

Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place

Careful where you tread 
Underfoot are the visions lost 
Sleeping not yet dead

Hang on - The beast is on the prowl

Strange cry 
Winds of change are blowing by 

Mountains crumble and cities fall 
Don't come to an end 
Just lie scattered on the 
Desert floor 
Waiting for the wind

You got your life planned carefully 
But you left out one detail 
The hidden hand deals just one round 
And the winds of change prevail

Nothing new in the sands of time

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,

I was so sure that love had led me to your door
Was it a dream, nothing more

Inside my head
I keep hearing all the tender words we said
Who were they for

We are strong
We can hold on to each other if we try
And make it right, for you and I
There's no goodbyes

Only the fool survives
Only the heart provides
Sweet love and tenderness

Life is change
But I never want to leave this love behind

Where there's love
There is nothing strong enough to come between
What we believe
And break us up where there is love

Only the fool survives
Only the heart provides
Sweet love and tenderness
Save us tonight

Only the fool survives
Even the hardest times
Let all the love we share
Keep us alive

See your eyes in a million faces
See your smiles in a thousand places
And I never escape your memories

You'd be there everywhere that I go
You're the only real thing I know
And I never wanted to be free
Stay here with me

Sweet love and tenderness
