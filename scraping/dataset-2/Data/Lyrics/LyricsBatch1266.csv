Weiss,"'Cause it's been so long
Since I held you tight
When we said good night
It's been so long
Honey, can't you see
What you've done to me?
I've been in a kind of daze
For days and days and days
Feelin' blue, missin' you
In, oh, so many ways
'Cause it was so nice
When we had that date
Every night at eight
It was so nice
Then we said good-bye
What a fool was I
Let me get back in your arms where I belong
'Cause it's been, oh, so long",It's Been So Long,1994
Weiss,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town,1994
Weiss,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Weiss,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

The lights go down in Baltimore
Blink your eyes, the sun is coming up
The radio
Is playing songs we shouldn't know
But never seems to be quite loud enough

The traffic lights, they match the backlit sky
Colors fade like the fourth of July
Maybe I'm not thinking right
Took one day to fall down beneath you
Just one dream to make this the real truth
Another kiss could bring this all into the light

And I don't want to be addicted
I just want to be that high
To see the northern lights in your eyes
Don't want the complication
I just want to know the truth
I want one more moment in you

There's no turning back from here
As the candlelight goes dancing your eyes
22 years
8 am seems late to me
Now I've lost all concept of time

The clock alarm's been going on for days
Why must I dream to see your face
Maybe I'm not thinking right
Took one day to fall down beneath you
Just one dream to make this the real truth

I just want to be that high
To see the northern lights in your eyes
Don't want the complication
I just want to know the truth

When I can't breathe

A new breed of problem can arise
Color the air with a white light blanket

Wherever you face puts the dark on your shoulder
Your secrets are waiting right inside this folder
Watching all along

But you won't have to wait
And I won't have to hate
The way the sunlight hits me when it falls upon my face
I got too much time on my hands

And it's a long way over from the field to the stands
I twist around my feelings for what it commands
And it's ugly

Scatter your seeds both far and wide
Deal with the heat and keep your wits around you
Take a seat and let the water flow down through
The space that lies where the cold surrounds to
Where I rest my head

Float and you glow like you were everything holy
Look at it spread like a carpet below me

Appears a curious celestial phenomena
Called Black Star, but what is it?

Black people unite and let's all get down
We got to have what?  We got to have that love

What is the Black Star?
Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car?
Is it shining from very far, to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant
Fresher than an infant

Black, my family thick, like they're striped molasses
Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air

Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship that later brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin cross hairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
Cause this life is warfare, warfare

Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who, on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like ""la cocina""
Make without imagine happen but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rockin tracks like John Coltrane love Naema

Like the student love the teacher
Like the prophet love Khadeja
Like I love my baby features
Like the creator love all creatures

Who acknowledge truth and peace seekers
We on point like heat seekers
Targeting the black marketing strategists
Run up on em with the heaters
Everybody following with no leaders
Feeling like we killing ourselves
Because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay Black and God

Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like feh-lah man cry
Some man wan ask ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I., V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic""
Work to respect the angelic, climb the mountaintop
And tell it til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat but you nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly

You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star, who we?  (And we)

Go from the dark

Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes
When you froze in

Dead that
Before you get your head wrapped
Like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealing with that black magic
Try to civilize you
Not walk on by you
Like civil-(lies do get you black listed) it'll
Be unlucky for you like a black cat
A panther
Revolution is the answer
That's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer
True indeed

Now black people unite, and let's all get down

But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's 
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Verte venir
Y como desconocidos sonreír

Que impotencia que no sea junto a mi

Pero fui algo más que tonto y te perdí
No sabes cuanto anhelo tus miradas
Y hoy que estas tan cerca
Parece que de ti yo no fui nada

Que no daría
Por volver meter a mi boca las palabras
Que te dije aquel día
Y que me dañaron el alma
Yo me siento culpable de que por mi lloraras
Que no daría por regresar el tiempo
Y que no te acuerdes de nada

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the No Man's Land
From ""The Rising Sun"" to ""The Friend at Hand""

I bet you gonna ambush me

A name, whisper game

You better make up something quick

Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools

I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland
Was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain!

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew

Think about all the things you said
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do
You're on my mind, make this dream come true

I'm wasting time
You could be mine
I can't take this pain any more
Baby, your pleasure, I just gotta know

If I could only spend a moment with you
That meant, we have a chance to kiss tonight
I can't see calling for nobody but you

I feel the rush inside me when I'm with you
And when you lie beside me
I can't see falling for nobody but you

Now maybe this, I quietly slip away
Or better yet, maybe, I should stay
I'm so confused, I'm running out of time
If I were free, I know that you would be mine

I can't explain, this is insane
He's here, next to me
Oh baby, can't you see?
This is your true lover factor, say yeah

If I could only spend a moment with you
That meant, we have a chance to kiss tonight
I can't see falling for nobody but you

I feel the rush inside me when I'm with you
And when you lie beside me
I can't see falling for nobody but you

Please take me out of this nightmare
I have a right to be free
I need the heat of your passion
Give me a taste of ecstasy

No one can love me like you do, baby
You got me burning for nobody but you
Nobody else could satisfy me

Wendy Moten,"We were a flower 
That never reach full bloom 
We never gave our love much chance to grow 
Even though the feeling was wonderful 
We went on our separate ways 
And all we know 
It's what we share is more than most 

[Chorus] 
'Cause we came all so very close to love 
But we let it slip away 
I always wondered why 
You never chose to stay 
So close to love 
Sometimes it seems like it was only yesterday 
I find myself dreaming of 
How we came all so very close to love 

I always remember 
The way you care for me 
Time after time my life was in despair 
Yet somehow I always knew you'll be right there 
At times I did not have a prayer 
I'm sure that you and I both know 

[Chorus] 

That we came all so very close to love 
But we let it slip away 
I always wondered why 
You never chose to stay 
So close to love 
Sometimes it seems like it was only yesterday 
And I think I had a lover 
And we came all so very close to love 
 
How can I face the fact it's over 
We're through 
I can't believe it's true 
When I'm alone 
Sometimes I wonder if you knew 
How much I care for you 
So I'm hanging on to the memories 
How hard you make sweet love to me 
And it's so hard to let it go

Meet me there at a half past eight
At our usual place
I really need to see you just one more time
Before we say our goodbyes to all that we have, my baby

Please don't make it harder than it already is
You know I feel the same way about you
We shared both the good times and the bad
But no mountains or valleys or heartaches or pain
Are gonna keep me from loving you

Whatever it takes
We can do it, baby

Who try to bring our love to an end
They say, we really never had a chance from the start
But what I feel is real, real in my heart
I can't let you go, no, baby

Each and every night I knelled down and pray
For our love to grow stronger each day
No one ever said that loving you would be so easy
We've had laughter and tears, ups and downs through the years
But I'll never stop lovin' you

Whatever it takes
You know we can do it, baby
Whatever it takes
I know I'll see you through it, yes I will

We've come too far to turn back now
It's sad that what we've always been
Nothing in this world will keep us down
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby
We gotta hold on, stay strong
Never give up on love

At your side and find I haven't lied about nothin'
I wouldn't trade a tree for the way I feel about you
In the mornin', anyhow I love you

who's how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
'cause I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy

Verse One:

I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
'cause you wasn't tryin to see 
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
'cause you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied

Verse Two:

Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
'cause it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
through thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Verse Three:

I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears
Happy as can be
To see man woman and child
As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out
Can't let em see us fall
But most of all 
Thank you God
'cause for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Werner Muller & His Orchestra,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

You are temptation and I am yours

Werner Müller & His Orchestra,"There's just a few more hours.
That's all the time you've got.
A few more hours
Before they tie the knot.

There are drinks and girls all over London, and I've
gotta track 'em down in just a few more hours!
I'm getting married in the morning!
Ding dong! The bells are gonna chime.
Pull out the stopper!
Let's have a whopper!
But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the mornin'
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.
Girls, come and kiss me;
Show how you'll miss me.
But get me to the church on time!
If I am dancin'
Roll up the floor.
If I am whistlin'
Whewt me out the door!
For I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Kick up an rumpus
But don't lost the compass;
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church,
For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

I'm getting married in the morning
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Doolittle
Drug me or jail me,
Stamp me and mail me.

But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.

Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table,

And get em to the church on time!

If I am flying
Then shoot me down.
If I am wooin',
Get her out of town!

For I'm getting married in the morning!
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.

Feather and tar me;
Call out the Army;
But get me to the church.

Get me to the church

For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

Starlight is reelin' home to bed now.
Mornin' is smearin' up the sky.
London is wakin'.
Daylight is breakin'.
Good luck, old chum,
Good health, goodbye.

I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime...
Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me...
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church...

Wes,"I'm on a dock overlooking my mind
I hitch my boat and I drift off
Where fools whisper lies

Everything's a sign when dreams come alive

I'm not crazy at all, my friends they talk 
I try to listen, but waves keep crashing 
Against my mind to pull me where 
The years are days and all those days are years I've lost 
They've finally come to tell me 
I'm alive in a boat to catch myself inside a dream

Everything's a sign when dreams come alive
Everything's a sign but still 
You're asking why love is across 
The frozen lake that always seems to break when you walk to the other side

You are here now
We're not crazy at all
You are free now
We're not crazy at all
You are safe now
We're not crazy at all
You are",Dream,2003
Wes Borland,"Out of control of a history untold 
It begins with the father of sin 
I walk alone in the garden of stones 
I turn into the monster within 
Life is too long for me 
Life is too wrong for me 

'Cause there's something that 
I realize 
That I miss being human 
I realize 
That I miss being human 
Nothing Times

I lose control as the story unfolds
I have been like a knife to bare skin
I walk alone like a king with no throne
I burn up from the monster within
Life is too long for me
Life is too wrong for me

'Cause there's something that 
I realize 
That I miss being human

Bullfrog, doing it again

Childlike no one understands

Some kind of innocence is 
Measured out in years

To listen to your fears
 
You can talk to me

Threw her back on the seat and drove into the stars

There are memories that run like water
As I walk down these old streets

Just freedom to do something wrong

Wes Carr,"Could have Guitars that I have never played, 
Every Elvis album ever made.
I got the cars, I should learn to drive
Could have a house that would blow your mind!

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth having if I ain't got you,
You can take what you want cause I don't want nothing, I've nothing if I don't have you.

I've been to places all around the world,
Seen the faces of so many girls.
Never thought I would fall in love,
I guess the songs I write are not enough

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth having if I ain't got you,
You can take what you want cause I don't want nothing, I've nothing if I don't have you.

I can say what I need but I'll never need anything more, if I didn't have you.

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth having if I ain't got you.

So take it away, you know I don't need that sorrow if I'm broke I'll borrow.
Just lend me a smile,
As long as your here by my side!

Take what you want, ain't got nothin', ain't got nothin but you babe.
Take what you want babe, ain't got nothin' 
Oh I ain't got nothin'

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth having if I ain't got you (Aint got you)
You can take what you want cause I don't want nothing, I've nothing if I don't have you.

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth having if I ain't got you (Aint got you)
You can take what you want cause I don't want nothing, I've nothing if I don't have you.

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth having if I ain't got you

If I have sweet peace within

Wes Hampton,"So long I had searched for life's meaning,
Enslaved by the world and my greed,
Then the door of the prison was opened by love,
For the ransom was paid - I was free.

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow,
I'm free from the guilt of the past,
For I've traded my shackles for a glorious song,
I'm Free! Praise the Lord! Free at last!

I'm free from the guilt that I carried,
From that dull empty life I'm set free,
For when I met Jesus, He made me complete,
He forgot how foolish I used to be.

To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Than gold or silver ever could afford

And covers all the world

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

All the demons, all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory

And the sun refuses to shine
For there hangs God's son, in the balance
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over
It is finished, there'll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

So come one, come all and see the show tonight

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure

A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

That way was too long
And danced a little song

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Feed your eyes on cold grey city concrete
An extra pair of arms is what you really need
But keep the secret, today no one can touch you
Dine on passion, then let your heart bleed
Alone at night it's dark
Hear a lonely dog bark

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?



",Come into the Air,1980
Wesley McGoogan,"In the beginning was the word, man said: Let there be more light
Electric scenes and laser beams, neon brights the light abhorring nights
On the second day he said: Let's have a gas
Hydrogen and cholera and pest
Let's make some germs, we'll poison the worms
Man will never be suppressed

And he said: Behold what I have done
I've made a better world for everyone
Nobody laugh, nobody cry
World without end, forever and ever
Amen, amen, amen

On the third we get green and blue for pie
On the fourth we send rockets to the sky
On the fifth make the beasts and submarines
On the sixth man prepares his final dream:
In our image, let's make robots for our slaves
Imagine all the time that we can save
Computers, machines, the silicon dream
Seventh he retired from the scene

And he said: Behold what I have done
I've made a better world for everyone
Nobody laugh, nobody cry
World without end, forever and ever
Amen (amen), amen (amen), amen (amen)

On the eighth day machine just got upset
A problem man had never seen as yet
No time for flight, a blinding light
And nothing but a void, forever night

He said: Behold what man has done
There's not a world for anyone
Nobody laughed, nobody cried
World's at an end, everyone has died
Forever amen (amen), amen (amen), amen (amen)

He said: Behold what man has done

Wesley McGoogan,"What do you do when they turn on the light?
You guard your heart, so they steal your sight
You reach out in blindness, touch the alone
His icicle fingers chill you to the bone

What do you do when the cat gets ya tongue?
No way to tell it's all going wrong
Mouth out the words on the telephone
Nobody answers, nobody's home...

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

Well, I reach out in blindness now, but what do I care?
I'll walk into walls and I'll stumble downstairs
I'll laugh like a fishwife, I'll cry like a clown
Up is the only way to go when you're down

When I reach a mountain top, then I start to climb
I'll walk on the water, I'll turn water to wine
Hope is the one thing we got on our side
Hope can be salvaged when all else has died

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

What's done has been done, and I won't be the one
Who despairs in the wheelchair, resigned to ""If only""
No, I'll stand up again and I'll run

By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""



",If Only,1980
Wesley McGoogan,"What kind of things are you that deliver papers
White papers that you say apply to me
Reams of rules constructed for protection
Protection for yourselves, but not for me

You hide behind your walls of bureaucracy
I find that you've nothing to do with me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

Today you went out to inspect your servants
I saw you wave and rave from my T.V.
You promised soon that they would have a paper
Give them the right to kill quite legally

So you hide in your palace of bureaucracy
I hope that you never come terminate me
You're all aliens
I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties

I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties
A-I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties
A-I opened up my eyes, and saw to my surprise
Monsters in disguise, wearing bowler hats and old school ties



",Monsters in Disguise,1980
Wesley McGoogan,"Round and round and round again
Increasing circles, what a fun game!
We think we're different, we're not the same
As you and me and she and he

And we always believed that we're something unique
Our new little rich friends want us in their clique
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

There's you scratching my back, me scratching yours
Rub up the right way, it always ensures
We'll know the right people, open right doors
To the land of the famous incredible bores

And I got no respect for you, you're just a fake
Gave up your lot for a bite of the cake
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stuck at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal

Your smug little cliches, they get up my nose
Your hair dyed, your fine clothes, they're all for the pose
Naked before me, your cover is blown

Here come the robots, the mindless, the clones
And you sold up our insides, body and soul
Do as you're told now, and we'll play our roles
And we'll play, we'll play all of our days away

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stop at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal

How could we feel? We're so unreal
Stop at the top of the wheel
You're the sucker who fell for their spiel
You're the crawler who fell for their deal ... [fade out]



",Top of the Wheel,1980
Wesley McGoogan,"Living in the shadow of the mushroom tower
Who needs it?
Find no shelter from that kind of shower
Who needs it?
Nuclear rain, melting my brain
Who needs it - not you, not me, who needs this insanity?

At the top of the tower there's a creature who wants power
Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
If he gets in the dungeon, he could just press the button
Who needs it? (Who needs it?)
He'll flee inside, and you'll have nowhere to hide
Who needs it - not you, not me, who needs this insanity?

Who needs it, who needs it?
I need it like a hole in the head
Don't need it, don't need it
Here comes the era, the era of the living dead

(Who needs it, who needs it?)
(Who needs it, who needs it?)
(Who needs it, who needs it?)
(Who needs it, who needs it?)

Who needs it, who needs it?
I need it like a hole in the head
Don't need it, don't need it
Here comes the era, the era of the living dead
(Who needs it, who needs it?)

Who needs it, who needs it?
I need it like a hole in the head
Don't need it, don't need it
Here comes the era, the era of the living dead
(Who needs it, who needs it?)

Who needs it, who needs it?
I need it like a hole in the head
Don't need it, don't need it

Wesley McGoogan,"You drink your coffee, 
I sip my tea, 
And we're sitting here, playing so cool, 
Thinking, 'What will be, will be.' 
And it's getting kind of late now, 
Oh, I wonder if you'll stay now, 
Stay now, stay now, stay now, 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'? 
I move a little closer to you, 
Not knowing quite what to do and I'm 
Feeling all fingers and thumbs, 
I spill my tea, oh silly me, 
It's getting kind of late now, 
I wonder if you'll stay now, 
Stay now, stay now, stay now, 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'? 
And then we touch, much too much, 
This moment has been waiting for a long, long time, 
Makes me shiver, 
Makes me quiver, 
This moment I am so unsure, 
This moment I have waited for, 
Well is it something you've been waiting for, 
Waiting for too? 
Take off your eyes, 
Bare your soul, 
Gather me to you and make me whole, 
Tell me your secrets, 
Sing me the song, 
Sing it to me in the silent tongue. 
It's getting kind of late now, 
I wonder if you'll stay now, 
Stay now, stay now, stay now, 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'?",Will You?,1980

On the floor, knocked down by booze

Excuses by the faint of heart
Stuck in the mud before they start

As opposed to always travelling underneath the ground?

Wesley Prince,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,2001

Each little drop that falls on my window pane
Always reminds me of tears I've shed in vain
I sit and wait for the sun to shine down on me once again

That's why I get the blues when it rains
