Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

Enrique Iglesias,"Lunes gris, me siento mal 
Con las horas, why siempre igual 
Yo se que solo tu voz me salvara 
Las calles brillan de oro why sol 
En mi ventana el mundo exterior 
Todo es gris, me siento frio, que solo estoy
Ten compasion 
Perdoname ya 
No quise ver la verdad 

[CORO:] 
Why hoy que no estas 
Solo me importas tu 
Solamente tu 
Why no puedo mas 
Solo me importas tu 
Solamente tu 

Sin dormir, mejor sonar 
Despues me rio, por no llorar 
Yo se que solo tu piel, me puede salvar. 
No seas cruel, no puedo cambiar 
Jamas te podria olvidar 

why hoy que no estas, 
Solo me importas tu 
Solamente tu 
Why no puedo mas 
Solo me importas tu 
Solamente tu 
Solamente tu 

Jamas te podria olvidar 
Why hoy que no estas 
Yo que voy a hacer sin ti

Now you're here by my side
You are next to me
I want to hold you
And touch you and taste you
And make you want no one but me
I wish that this kiss could never end, no no

I don't want any night to go by
Without you by my side
I just want all my days
Spent being next to you
Lived for just loving you
And baby, oh by the way

Es así

Sin querer
Nos va bien

Dice no

Si decides dejarme
No te voy a suplicar
Allá tú si más tarde
Aunque corras, te escondas
No puedes escapar
Aunque corras, te escondas
No puedes escapar

Hoy si te vas
Ya verás
Que no es tan fácil olvidar
Sabe bien
Sabe mal
Como sea pero es tan real
Que al final
Lo demás
No te importa

Si decides dejarme
No te voy a suplicar
Allá tú si más tarde
Aunque corras, te escondas
No puedes escapar
Aunque corras, te escondas

Da lo mismo despertar
Que morir de amor
Que morir mi amor

Morir mi amor

Que estar feliz y tú lo estás y sentirte bien

At least you can predict this every year

I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me

And decide all the man I can ever be.

I could never see us ending like this (Do you know?)

And you're screaming to the top of your lungs
And the bell's done rung
And the crowd can't hear you
And all that I can see is a building burning
(I just gotta rescue my baby)
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone, I just wanna be here
Would you pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking
And the only one who can save me is you, but you want to

Throw me away

Girl, 'cause it changes
And it ain't got to be no real reason
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that opens, and the moment you walk in, it close
(Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help)

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar

Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras

Por ella es gigante 
Dame un shoc al corazón 
De pasión fulminante 
Ven conmigo 
Y de la cara no me quites el guante 

Hay veces que pedimos demasiado 
Sin dar nada a cambio 
No dejemos que muera este amor 
Eres muy simple, muy sencilla, 
Y ala ves demasiado grande 
Ehhh…algo perfecto (princesa)

One day at a time

Saw you in the club
You were dancing with somebody
So close so tight
You were killing me so slowly
My friends were telling me what you're doing
Can drive a man so crazy
Trying to live my life
It's been 6 months since you left me

So I oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day, one day, one day
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time

I am not the jealous heart
But you stole my heart baby
Dancing with that guy
Made it so hard for me to watch baby
I just been around running in circle
I'm going through it in my mind baby
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls
To stop from crying out loud baby

Oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
Can't stop thinking about you baby
Oh I oh I
I keep thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, and I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

First thing I gotta do is try to face it (try to face it)
But your voice keeps playing in my ear (playing in my ear)
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it (trying to fake it)
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go

My mind is running wild tryin' hard not to fall
You told me that you love me but say I'm just a friend
My heart is broken up into pieces
'Cause I know I'll never free my soul
It's trapped between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

Why oh why tell me why not me
Why oh why we were meant to be
Baby I know I could be all you need
Why oh why oh why

I wanna love you
If you only knew how much I love you
So why not me

The day after tomorrow I'll still be around
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down
You say that we're forever our love will never end
I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know
You'll never feel my soul

It's trapped between true love and being alone

That girl you will always be mine

There goes my baby
My wholesome lady
Hold me down if my whole world went crazy
That' s what she spoke
Just what she said
Now that's a joke
That talk is dead
Know I got to get over the love I had
The door I keep it open just in case she come back
Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad
And I know my hearts broken but I've got so attached
Baby come back I won't get no sleep
She more than I want and all that I need
Locked up my heart and threw away the key so
And when my baby come back I'm crossing my T's dotting my I's
And now I can't eat
Out of my mind
And that's how it's gonna be so, so

Hey!

There goes my baby
Whoa
Hey hey baby come back to me

Enrique Iglesias,"Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill
Break your heart and make you love her still
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill

Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne
Make you feel so damn alone
Leave you begging baby come back home

And it's only till she's gone
Could you see that you were wrong

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know

Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun
When your wings melt and you come undone
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one

She steals your heart just like a thief
Makes you lay roses at your feet
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed

And it's only till she's gone
Could you see that you were wrong

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know

You thank God you found her
can't live your life without her
And every little thing about her is all you need
All you need

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know, only a woman

de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

Son las mismas que alumbraron
con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

Y aunque no quise el regreso
siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

La vieja calle
donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

mirar de las estrellas
que con indiferencia
hoy me ven volver.

con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

Tengo miedo de las noches
que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

Through these tears I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand
Can save my life

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello she gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There will never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart
With very special things
With angle songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love that anywhere I go
I am never lonely
With her along
Who can be lonely?
I reach for here hand
It is always them

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answer now
But this much I can say
I know I will need her till the stars all burn away
And she will be there

Feel the rhythm just move with me;
Let me know,
That you want me, just let me know

We're raising our hands to the sky;
The feeling is making me high,
Don't ever stop,
The rhythm makes me feel like I'm alive

And mail it right away

C'è chi è di strada e sulla traccia, spacca sì, ma pochi (sì, ma pochi)
Gli altri tutti torte in faccia, Steve Aoki
Quei palazzi e motorini sono di Alpignano
Impenniamo anche le auto come Celentano
Qua la zona è calda
Fanno i viali su una ruota come a Philly, ma dagli anni Ottanta
Non me la bevo la tua storia pazza
Dalle mie parti sono tutti pazzi, oh
Sarà qualcosa nell’acqua
Guardala dall’alto come i droni sul quartiere
La formula funziona e tutti in serie
Cambiano gli attori, non la serie
La forza di una storia sta nel raccontarla bene
Quindi manda da bere, non c’è sofferenza
Manca un po’ di poesia, bro, non mi interessa

Ho iniziato a farli che c’era ancora la lira
Ora sto attento anche a non stropicciarli che la mia donna non stira
È tutto apposto, bro, tutto apposto
Conosco bene ‘sti lemmi e cliché
Però fai occhio che a fare il grosso
Alla fine becchi quello più grosso di te
Sarà che l’ho già visto, l’ho già fatto, l’ho già detto e pure meglio
Ma non fa per me
Sarà che me ne sbatto
Questo fumo vale oro e c’ho un un ovetto, tipo Fabergè
O sarà che sono onesto
Che vedo ancora qualche cosa di più grande in queste barre a tempo
Oltre lo stile, l’abbigliamento, le fighe, fare i soldi, le fisse, l’atteggiamento
Ma sai che c’è?
Non conta la motivazione, ma il giudizio
C’è il dito inquisitore e tu zitto
Metti il video del mio funerale su YouTube
E vediamo quante view e quanto monetizzo
Mi tocco le palle, tocco il ferro, porta bene, sdrammatizzo
Dici il vero è nella casa, dammi l’indirizzo
Che il più vero qua mi deve due mesi d’affitto
E ora che il piatto è ricco sono tutti qui

C’è da non crederci ma è ancora al livello anche quella
Non hai le basi e canti a cazzo anche se vai a cappella
Vuoi il mio commento sul tuo pezzo? La base è bella
Lo faccio ancora per chi studia questa merda come scienza
E si allena come in palestra sopra le instrumentals
Per ogni vero MC, è grazie a voi se rimo
Grazie ad ogni vero king, rest in peace Primo

‘Fanculo te e le rime scrause del tuo ghostwriter

La lancetta che va a tempo finché tutto torna
Lo schiaffo che rinfresca la memoria corta

Il cappello col becco e le Timberland

Canottiera a coste, Polo Lacoste
Come vincere i Mondiali
Come se vincessero gli indiani
Come l’iPhone che però non si scarica
Il 3310 con la fotocamera
Il poster del bomber col 10 che hai in camera
Toppe sul bomber, la tuta dell’Adidas
Andare in disco domenica pome
O in sala giochi con un gettone
Come il Milan dell’Ottantanove
Sono come Dylan che non ritira il Nobel
Statham, Willis, Nicki, Missy, Tarantino, Kubrick
Mi spiace ragazzo, ma se non capisci qualcosa basta che la googli

Mi sveglio ancora tutti i giorni come alla partenza
Come se avessi un’occasione e fosse questa
Finché ho la voce non importa se esce croce o testa
Ho visto le speranze scivolare come anguille
Fra palazzi popolari a schiera con dietro le ville
Cresciuto con la fame di essere uno fra i mille
L’odio sulle papille, il fuoco nelle pupille
Questa musica puntava il dito, Zio Sam
E trovare pace nello sfogo è il mio giardino zen
Lo sa Dio se la vendetta è meglio dell’amore
Spesso un “per sempre” dura un paio d’ore
La vita è arte, rivoluzione
Come farne parte è interpretazione
È la mia visione frate, esci a piedi vieni e vedi

Baci sporche come banconote
Sulle guance come chi non osa

Ma cercavo amore in queste note
Porto i segni sulla pelle, hai visto?
Mai mischiare il sangue con il business

Se domani il sole bacia un altro culo

Fino al filtro quelle non le passo
Non spartisco i drammi miei giù in piazza
Lavo ancora i panni sporchi a casa

Pungono le mie come le spine
Senza rose, leggi fra le righe

Ho brindato col vino

Apro il frigo sembra un atelier

Ma ho un imbosco con l’oro e col cash
In un buco nel muro nascosto da un quadro 
Quanto le sta bene il tailleur
Lo sa bene perché fa il lavoro che ha sempre sognato
Stampa biglietti per la prima classe
Sognando vacanze in una meta a caso
Io cinque su sette in Europa dell’Est
E alle volte pure più lontano
Ma la paga ripaga lo stress
E sommo trasferte, più lo straordinario
Quindi progettiamo un weekend a Paris
Ma di giovedì son 2k di viaggio
Dai campi elisi a Rue Saint-Denis
Ne spendo altri due come fossero omaggio
Giuro, per vivere sempre così
Ci metto la firma come dal notaio
A settimana mezz’etto di weed
Prendiamo un mesetto di ferie a febbraio

A cinquanta metri quadri in stanza coi miei due fratelli
Adesso ho quadri alle pareti dentro un loft a due livelli
Tutta questa musica come un fottuto sogno ad occhi aperti
Ora cambio vita ed è una vita che ci provo
È la mia rivincita dopo il salto nel vuoto
Mi ci pago gli affitti, i vizi, il lusso
Di svegliarmi la mattina e farne una grossa
Uscire a colazione, a pranzo, a cena
Poi tornare tardi e addormentarci sul terrazzo con la luna rossa
Farlo ancora come se fosse la prima volta
Ci manca solamente il mare sotto casa nostra
Era una favola anche prima, ma col sacrificio
Ricordo noi su quella spiaggia bianca alle Mauritius
Amo Antigua aragoste e fuochi d’artificio
Alle Canarie in quelle foto già eravamo in tre
Ti dicevo “Credi in me”, ‘fanculo l’invidia
Prima la famiglia, il sangue è la sua linea

Che fare branco perché la testa è la stessa
A scuola l’ultimo banco
“Scusi professoressa posso andare al bagno che tanto non mi interessa?”
Poi in tre su di una Tigra, in zona girando a zonzo
Fischiare ad ogni figa, Illmatic in sottofondo

Tutto e vedere il mondo

Quindi sei con o sei contro

Ma siamo cresciuti uguale
Ognuno coi suoi drammi chiuso in un garage
A fumare fino a tardi
E immaginare noi da grandi
E ora che siamo grandi dimmi che si fa
Che ognuno va per la sua strada
Chi i figli e la moglie a casa col mutuo e la busta paga
Chi invece non l’ha trovata e tratta ancora la vita da troia
Così l’ha interpretata, che se tutto quadra è noia
Io vendicato dal rispetto, dall’affermazione
Dal rappresentare ste persone e renderle orgogliose
Poteva andare molto peggio, non è andata male
Sta vita mi voleva morto e mi ha reso immortale

Ensi, Negrita band 
Se tutti parlano chi sta ascoltando?
Non vi sento nel silenzio che mi sta assordando
Ora chiedono a tutti a cosa stai pensando?
Ma sarebbe meglio dire almeno stai pensando?
Perché davvero qua non sembra affatto
C'è chi ci casca e fa cascare un altro
E chi ne parla tanto giusto per parlare tanto
Pensavi la fine fosse vicina al capolinea
Fra era due fermate prima e stiamo deragliando
C'è chi insomma va tutto bene
Finché il link della serie funziona e si vede bene
Finché ha un drink da bere e calma da mantenere ma si
Cazzo mene
I poeti ora fanno meme
Chi cerca dosi di fede la merce più rara in piazza
Chi teme di più le Iene della finanza
Notizie ANSA, qua scende e risale l'ansia
La paura lascia solchi profondi linee di Nazca
Oh mio Dio
C'è chi le sa tutte
E chi si aggrappa all'odio con le unghie
Chi c'è rimasto un po' sotto e vede il complotto ovunque
Chi alla verità non ci crederà comunque

C'è chi è fermo a un ostacolo
Mente a se stesso e poi mente anche al diavolo (hey, hey)
C'è chi è fermo al semaforo
Chi aspetta il verde chi aspetta un miracolo

Ensiferum,"Sing for your tears
A song of the hatred
No one can hear
'Cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
But my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
Inside this empty room

[Chorus:]
They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away

The night is dark when you're alone
And sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'Cause your wishes didn't come true

Nothing seems real anymore
As I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
That keeps me sane

",Ferrum Aeternum,2004
Ensiferum,"The silence breakes the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Twelve thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure

Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride

Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood

Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than death

Shadows are dancing on the forest walls

In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold

Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminious sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light

I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart

I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams

I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive





",Slayer of Light,2004
Ensiferum,"[Grim man's tale:]
[I:] A flaming blade of the dark shadows struck the lands
With furious lightning it fell into the hands of man
And the ancient fire came down
Down from the sky into the ground
The clouds moved aside as the sword was cast from the sky
Burnt by a mark of fire, who shall make this find
And the grey clouds were watching down, down from the sky into the ground
...As the shapes of light were drowned

[II:] Creatures started crowling from the ashes and smoke
And the night was cursed and drifting within the winds so cold
And the knights from the sea were marching down
To the deep caverns down, down where the old spells are found
The war was growing in the old lands and towns
From the mountains war drums pounded with a defeaning sound
They'll seek the Sowrd forevermore, until in battle they'll fall
...Now, hear the battle's call

Who dares to play with death
Who smells the dragon's breath
No grief for the fallen ones
The search for the sword has begun

[Carved in stone:]
Great as the mountains and seas
Grim as the earth and old trees
Made from the glimmer of golden lakes
Chained with fire that never fades
Rocks and stones they carve and mould
When the rivers run fierce and cold
May this chant haunt your past
For this Sword is yours at last

Raise the arms the battle is near
Through the mud and waters clear
The blood is coloring the lands again
A sign of victory the wind will send





",Sword Chant,2004
Ensiferum,"He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known
Into darkness now fallen, into hatred now grown
Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas
Of blood, crushing all his dreams
No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes
Devotion for death, now controls his life
No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge

One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone
One life so cold and gray, wandering away from home

Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those deadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound
Forever bound to death!

Wait for me in the mountains, haunt for me in the winds
Wait for me in the land where nothing lives
Until the day I have found revenge, I will feed my sword
Until my heart is cold, every breath of mine is yours

Ensiferum,"Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While it's sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams

I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone

Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee

Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

Stunning and bitter but very summoning.

To find is your possibility
And to search is your quest

It's easier to be afraid
To be deceived, to be a sheep
Be aware, question them
Question yourself
Because once you see it
You can never look away

Every man's
Horizon can change
But eternal skies
Will always stay the same

Like a new sun arises from winter's
Cold and dark grave, it's unstoppable

Keep your twisted beliefs

Calling me

The fire that burns my flesh
Shall light up the words I've said
The curse on my innocent name
Shall put all of your in shame

Woe to the man
Who disheartens the few
Who reach for the light
Who searches for the truth

I only have just one more wish
That this torch will be passed onto someone sentient
Like you
When your time comes
Don't lose your heart
Have faith and patience and trust in the
Flame before passing it onto someone new

The greatest power of all
Will force their gods to fall
The greatest power of all
Embrace, illuminate all!

The silence inside this place is screaming
Here, were the roses never wither, as they never bloomed
Here the sun never shone
Even the darkness never came in
No hope, no fear
An ocean of tears, that never fell
Tomorrow brings remembrance of opened wounds
The light invaded the endless darkness
A soul, which birth was denied
A soul that became forgotten
The darkness fades away even the brightest color
The street is empty, and leads to nowhere
A shrilling scream, that no one heard
Who cares? We can all be free
""Tomorrow is a new day,
But today was new as well...
..For only thing is fear felt
The fear of life""
Fallen asleep, wrapped in a blood red blanket
Two dead eyes are staring into emptiness

Death greets the one life forgot

Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire, but no hope
She longs for home, bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile
Mardol, you glorious, sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh, but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace
Gern you devoted yourself
And consumed many desire.
But, still in the night,
Gold is dripping from your eyes.

Then you shall be set free
Until that day you shall find no comfort

Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden,
Denying the existance pf praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe

Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould with pleasure
Apposed to mummifications through impotence

The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
Unlock the beast

Whose only truth is lie

You might have seen - just what I've seen

That you're following a fool
You think you're a part of something
But you are merely a tool

I destroy your world
Complex simplicity
Dissensions that I sow
That's why I don't tell you more
Than I need you to know
It's all in what I show
And your ignorance I bliss
What you don't know you won't miss
The apathy you find in me runs deep
Some secrets some reasons I will keep
The sympathy you offer me I reap
But every night when you sleep
I destroy your world",The Supreme Good,1999
Entombed,"[Originally performed by Black Sabbath]
[Original title - ""Under The Sun , Every Day Comes And Goes""]

Well I don't want no demon to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate them

People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

You know me, devil inside
You know me godless and wild
You know me, to each his own
But they just won't leave you alone

Sons of the morning
Princes of the world
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
No way we ain't
We are serpent saints

The little bit of you that got away

Reason lasts but for a while
Kill like it's going out of style
And with a price upon her head
Your mother starts to kook like bread

Sons of the morning
Princes of the world
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
No way we ain't
We are serpent saints

Redeem the lost tribes
I was buried alive
In the age of disgrace
Waiting to be saved
With lies in the blood
You will never see the day
Rise from the grave
You serpent saints

I'm the bit of you that got away

With the world at your feet
Control alternate delete
And when it's time to thin the herd
Make ten amendments to the word

Sons of the morning
Goddess absurd
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
Hell no we ain't
We are serpent saints
Sons of the morning
Gods of the worm
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
Hell no we ain't
We are serpent saints

Living and dying
We are serpent saints
Cheating and lying
We are serpent saints
Killing and crying
We are serpent saints
There's no denying
We are serpent saints

She'll lead you down through misery
And leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be
And if I had a nickel I'd find a game
And if I won a dollar I'd make it rain
And if it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied
It's legs to walk and thoughts to fly
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die
So tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none
I'm chained upon the face of time
Feeling full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave the dark behind

And she don't know where to turn
She's got this big ambition
But she doesn't seem to learn

She needs some love and affection
She just changes her direction
She's always had it easy
But she never thought it was

The boy that she's been pleasing
Prays that he's the only one
So she'll walk the streets of Miami
Just to keep her kid and candy

Gotta runaway, but don't know where to go
Says she'll run away, that's all been a show
Gotta Runaway, does a runaway
Runaway, hey!

She talks of being happy
As the tears roll down her face
She swears that she'll be laughing
When she finds a better place
'Til then it's paper roses
As her bank account, she closes

Enya,"How I remember sleepless nights
When we would read by candlelight,
And on the windowpane outside
A new world made of snow

A million feathers falling down,
A million stars that touch the ground,
So many secrets to be found
Amid the falling snow.

Maybe I am falling down.
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
In the darkness all around.

The silence of a winter's night
Brings memories I hold inside,
Remembering a blue moonlight
Upon the fallen snow.

Maybe I am falling down.
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
In the darkness all around.

I close my window to the night.
I leave the sky her tears of white.
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow.

Only in my dreams.
You're missing, but you're always
A heartbeat from me.
I'm lost now without you,
I don't know where you are.
I keep watching, I keep hoping,
But time keeps us apart.

Is there a way I can find you,
Is there a sign I should know,
Is there a road I could follow
To bring you back home?

Winter lies before me
Now you're so far away.
In the darkness of my dreaming
The light of you will stay.

If I could be close beside you
If I could be where you are
If I could reach out and touch you
And bring you back home

Is there a road I can follow
To bring you back home to me?",If I Could Be Where You Are,2005

I close my eyes and listen
I can hear the lonesome sound
Of the sky as it cries

Listen to the rain
Here it comes again

Feel the touch of tears that fall
They won't fall forever
In the way the day will flow
All things come, all things go

Listen to the rain, the rain
Here it comes again, again
Hear it in the rain, the rain

Late at night I drift away
I can hear you calling
And my name is in the rain
Leaves on trees whispering
Deep blue seas, mysteries

Can't let go this feeling
Everything will come again
In the sound falling down
Of the sky as it cries
Hear my name in the rain",It's in the Rain,2005

That break my heart in two,
I wonder how you can endure
All I've said, all I say to you.

How strong, how brave, how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave.
I know it tears your heart in two,
All I've said, all I say to you.

After all the words are said,
After all the dreams we made,
Every one a precious one,
Every one a summer sun

Can never be again,

All you said,
All you gave,
All your love to me.",A Moment Lost,2005

Sun is high above and winds are still enough and all I want to do is stay
And everywhere the blues are moving in the air I see them in their flight
Sun is high above and winds are still enough and all I want to do is stay

For seven days they make the sky look down upon them as they go their way
Sun is high above and winds are still enough and all I want to do is stay

For seven nights they wait the moment for the morning light to come again
Sun is high above and winds are still enough and all I want to do is stay

And one by one they wander one by one meander never go astray
Sun is high above and winds are still enough and all I want to do is stay

And so I stand and gaze and so I watch the maze of blues depart the day

The clouds moving slowly
Time was undone
Yet the days fell before us
And nights rolled on by

Were all so worthwhile

Enzo Avitabile,"Johnny era un bad boy
E finì dentro per una cazzata
I primi tempi erano duri e poi
So che si è preso anche qualche mazzata
Impara presto che la dentro nulla era graduato
In base al tipo di reato
E invece che a inseguire toccava far vedere
Tra servo e padrone chi sarebbe stato
Johnny era poco più di un ragazzino
Un giorno nella doccia trovò un marocchino
Il sangue scorreva a secchiate era marrone
Non era un film di Garrone
Poi fu come iniziare l’università
Con un esame al giorno tra le avversità
Scontando poi capisci si può darsi ma
Negli occhi un’altra luce incomincia a vedersi già

Punizione no soluzione, la malaeducazione
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar
Se jucan a fa mal
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar
Se jucan a fa mal

Nella testa di Johnny pensieri pesanti
Carichi neri come nuvole piovono pianti
Come tutti i lavori lui iniziò dal basso
La notte sempre sveglio pensando al primo passo
E tutti i giorni si ammazzava di flessioni
Preparandosi alla prima di molte missioni
Un'altra settimana la pelle dura squama
Ascoltava i vecchi e esercitava con la lama
Finalmente un giorno freddo che arriva il momento
Raddrizzare i torti e conti ed il regolamento
Durante l'ora d'aria li aspetta sulle scale
E Dio sa quanto gli fece male
Il giorno dopo tutti sai parlavano di lui
Dei muri delle celle e pure i corridoi
Perché qua diventi grande anche se non vuoi
Johnny era un bad boy

Il cielo non aveva nome
La terra non aveva nome
Lì dentro, tutto non aveva nome
Non aveva un nome

Punizione no soluzione, la malaeducazione
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar
Se jucan a fa mal
Pisci 'e paranza, int a stu mar
Se jucan a fa mal

Quando Johnny è uscito aveva un'altra faccia
Un'altra stazza rappresentava una minaccia
Ad aspettarlo gente che non ho mai visto
Riverito e idolatrato come Gesù Cristo
E lì ho capito che sto stato l'aveva educato
È uscito laureato a pieni voti
E lì ho capito quando mi ha salutato 
Che con Johnny adesso non ci fotti
E non è colpa sua fra non dico che è brutto 
Dentro senza sapere niente l'ha tipo distrutto
Ora le strade qua si preparano all'urto
Perché Johnny è uscito e presto si prenderà tutto

Une femme que plus rien ne dérange
Détenue de son abandon
Son ennui lui donne le change

Que retient elle de sa vie
Qu'elle pourrait revoir en peinture
Dans un joli cadre verni
En évidence sur un mur

Un mariage en Technicolor
Un couple dans les tons pastels
Assez d'argent sans trop d'efforts
Pour deux trois folies mensuelles

Elle a rêvé comme tout le monde
Qu'elle tutoierait quelques vedettes
Mais ses rêves en elle se fondent
Maint’nant son espoir serait d'être

Juste quelqu'un de bien

Où ma vie se penche sur le vide
Coupés tous les bruits du moteur
Au-dessus de terres arides

Je plane à l'aube d'un malaise
Comme un soleil qui veut du mal
Aucune réponse n'apaise
Mes questions à la verticale

J'dis bonjour à la boulangère
Je tiens la porte à la vieille dame
Des fleurs pour la fête des mères
Et ce week-end à Amsterdam

Pour que tu m'aimes encore un peu

A l'heure où s'enfuit le Bon Dieu

S'arrêtent parfois de poursuivre
L'ambition de marcher sur Rome
Et connaissent la peur de vivre

D'être au-delà des apparences

They didn't give me anything

So sharpen your teeth or lay flat!
You said you'd play clean, oh what a load of crap,
By the time that you were through with me
I had to take a bath
So sharpen your teeth or lay flat!
They said that it'd go good for me,
Rain diamonds and all that.
I stood out in the downpour
Getting hit by broken glass.
So sharpen your teeth or lay flat.

Me fait désirer la mer
C’est la mélancolie
Qui nous sépare
Je nous souhaite un rivage

Tu me manques
Quand tu me manques
En temps sans montre
En temps sincère
En temps nu et offert
Comme tu me manques
Quand tu me manques
En temps sans montre
En temps sincère

Au sommet d’une lunne tu t’endoirs loin de moi
A chaque jour une aube
Une seule à la fois

Que le chant d’un merle me réveille au matin
Que le soleil d’hiver
Balaie de son or mon chagrin
Qu’il creuse dans mon cœur
A en épuiser les mystères
Et nous offre le rivage

Qui  me manque 
Quand tu me manques
En temps sans montre
En temps sincère
Comme tu me manques
Quand tu me manques
En temps sans montre
En temps sincère
En temps nu et offert",Un Temps Sincère,2005

è passato del tempo e io ce l'ho nel sangue ancor.
Io vorrei io vorrei
ritornare laggiù da lei ma so che non andrò.
Questo e' un amore di contrabbando
meglio star qui seduto a guardare il cielo davanti a me.

il vento suona la sua armonica
che voglia di piangere ho.
Messico e nuvole

che voglia di piangere ho.

Chi lo sa come fa quella gente
che va fin là a pronunciare sì... mah!
Mentre sa che è già provvisorio l'amore
che c'è sì ma forse no... ah!
Queste son situazioni di contrabbando
a me non sembra giusto neanche in Messico, ma perchè?

Messico e nuvole il tempo passa con l'America

i suoi passi accompagnerà nel bene e nel dolor.

Enzo Jannacci,"Desolato, ma più che desolato incazzato, quando vedo che la gente si uccida
E, lo dicevo 50 anni fa, e lo ripeto ora, ancora, che forse è la volta buona
Che c’è uno tra voi che tra uno sputo e una spinta troverà un’altra penicillina
Altre forme d’amore, forse un po’ più di grinta,
Perché ?, I cantanti, cioè noi

Ma che problemi hai?
C'ho il problema che il tempo non mi basta mai
Ma che problemi hai?
Ho un fratello in galera e non gli basta mai
Ma che problemi hai?
C’ho il problema che il tempo non mi basta mai,
Non mi passa mai, non mi basta mai, non mi passa mai, non mi basta

Chi vuole fare a botte ti chiede
C’hai problemi?
Problemi secolari popolari nei quartieri
In ogni scala e su scala nazionale,
Ma per gli inglesi, italiani o albanesi è uguale
Problemi di pensioni rimosse,
Di debiti e storie, finite le scorte
Crollate le borse, aperte le porte,
La fame che arriva da chi non la conosce
Problema della sigaretta,
È monopolio di stato e stato di dipendenza
Dal petrolio d’Arabia, la badante polacca,
Dal metano di Mosca e dalla pasta di mamma
La religione è un problema se nega la scienza,
E l’ateo se non ha coscienza
Che se la droga in giro aumenta,
È perché ormai costa meno di un pieno di bonza

Desolato, se non trovo la risposta ai tuoi problemi
Desolato, se il mio canto ha degli alibi sinceri
Desolato, se poi il sole non ti ascolta più di tanto
Desolato, se la vita a me, a me piace ancora tanto
Problemi a capire che non c’è un ideale, problemi totali.
Ma io sono al mare. Eh, ho detto che sono al mare

Problemi del figlio del grande fratello,
Problemi per quelli che c’è solo quello
Problemi di notte, del grande amatore
Problemi di sporco, anzi di unto però del Signore
Ma che problemi c’hai?

Vorrei assumere e creare lavoro,
Ma qui fanno business solo I compro-oro
E le sale da gioco, io invece vendo fuoco,
Ma porto I scarp nel tennis e parlo da solo
Parole al vento all’ottanta percento,
Per capire certe cose ci vuole orecchio
Per vedere chi è il nemico serve uno specchio,
Per governare il mio paese ci vuole un vecchio

Ho visto un re, come Jannacci e Fo, gli ho chiesto
Vengo anch’io? Lui m’ha detto No, tu no
È un criminale ma non puoi punirlo, povero re, e povero anche il cavillo
Non ho problemi con il mondo, solo con voi che comandate, se ve ne andate
Sarà ancora bello come quando parla Gaber, desolato ma la vita a me piace!

Desolato, se non trovo la risposta ai tuoi problemi
Desolato, se il mio canto ha degli alibi sinceri
Desolato, se poi il sole non ti ascolta più di tanto
Desolato, se la vita a me, a me piace ancora tanto
Ma che problemi hai?

C’ho il problema che il tempo non mi basta mai
Ma che problemi hai?
Ho un fratello in galera e non gli basta mai

Non mi passa mai, non mi basta mai, non mi passa mai, non mi basta",Desolato,2013
Enzo Jannacci,"Farà piacere un bel mazzo di rose
E anche il rumore che fa il cellophane
Ma una birra fa gola di più
In questo giorno appiccicoso di caucciù

Sono seduto in cima a un paracarro
E sto pensando agli affari miei
Tra una moto e l'altra c'è un gran silenzio
Che descriverti non saprei

Oh, quanta strada nei miei sandali
Quanta ne avrà fatta Bartali
Quel naso triste come una salita
Quegli ochhi allegri da italiano in gita

E i francesi ci rispettano
Che le balle ancora gli girano
E tu mi fai, dobbiamo andare al cine
E vai el cine, vacci tu

È tutto un complesso di cose
Che fa sì che io mi fermi qui
Le donne a volte sì sono scontrose
O forse han voglia di far la pipì

E tramonta questo giorno in arancione
E si gonfia di ricordi che non sai
Mi piace restar qui sullo stradone
Impolverato, se tu vuoi andare, vai

E vai che io sto qui e aspetto Bartali
Scalpitando sui miei sandali
Da quella curva spunterà
Quel naso triste da italiano allegro

Tra i francesi che si incazzano
E i giornali che svolazzano
C'è un pò di vento, abbaia la campagna
E c'è una luna in fondo al blu

Tra i francesi che s'incazzano
E i giornali che svolazzano
E tu mi fai, dobbiamo andare al cine
E vai al cine, vacci tu

L'ultima carit di unaltra rumba

Ah Sudamerica

Un arco dal sereno al fortunale
Per dirti quanto grande la questione
Tra il danneggiato e lassicurazione

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Feel you're on the wrong track
Give it time, you'll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly

In your head, so many questions
The truth is your possession
The answer lies within your heart (within your heart)
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope
And you will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
'Cause if you turn another page
You will see that's not the way
The story has to end

And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Give it time, you'll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly

Looking at your situation
There's so much that you can do
Now's the time to make your stand
This is just an observation
In the end it's up to you
The future's in your hands

And if you need to find a way back
Feel you're on the wrong track
Give it time, you'll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you'll learn to fly

EPMD Millineum Ducats DefCon 9 2 G's 
Uh huh yeah 

Yeah it's like this why'all it's like that why'all 
It's like this why'all it's like that why'all 
It's like this why'all it's like that why'all 
Ay E Dub check it out 

MC's out there, you better stand clear 
EPMD is a world premier 
From New York straight talk, America's best 
Cold wild Long Island, is where we rest 

Style of the rap, makes your hands clap 
Take care of myself because the lines are strapped 
Day mean business, no time for play 
If you bite a line, we'll roll your way 
The more you bite, your body gets hot 
Don't get too close, because you might get shot 
Gnawin at my rhyme like a poisonous rat 
Don't play Dumbo, you're smarter than that 

It's my thing 

The rhythmatic style, keeps the rhyme flowin 
Good friends already bitin, without you knowin 
Can't understand, why your body's gettin weaker 
Then you realize, it's the voice from the speaker 
The mind become delirious, situation serious 
Don't get ill, go and get curious 

Nuff about that, let's get on to somethin better 
And if gets warm, take off the hot sweater 
And if you want some water, I'll get you a cup 
And if you don't want it, then burn the hell up 
I'm tellin you now boy, you ain't jack 
Talkin much junk like Mr. T at your back 
but he's not, so don't act cute 
Cause if you do you in hot pursuits 

It's my thing 

As the song goes on you will notice a change 
The way I throw down, the way I say my name 
The mic that I'm packin, is flame resistant 
So MC be cool, and keep your distance 
When I walk into the party girls are screamin at me 
I park my mic and my hoes, and then I yell FREEZE.. 
Music please 


Ah where was I? Oh yes 
Say a def rhyme then I plumb the rest 
Everytime I rock a rhyme I can tell that you like it 
Emotion is strong, like the mind of a psychic 
The mind is weary, floatin like a dove 
Sweating and things, like cause you was makin love 
Control the crowd, so they can accept it 
Total concentration is the perfect method 

It's my thing 

The wack I subtract, the strong I attack 
The ones who grab the mic and freeze, I throw it back 
I perfect and eject, make MC's sweat 
Take em off on the mic then I tell em step 
Not waiting or debating, cause MC's keep hating 
Play me too close, like two dogs mating 

Now let's get on with the rest of the lesson 
Don't really like it when suckers start messin 
Tryin to make a scene, talkin very loud 
Talkin much junk to attract a crowd 
You say you want to battle, your first mistake 
You get quiet and stuff, like you was at a wake 
In the beginnin, you knew you wasn't winnin 
Now you feel ashamed, your head starts bendin 
Kinda upset boy -- I understand 
You lost again -- I won, god damn 

It's my thing 

My funky fresh lyrics, put you in the spirit 
I speak a little louder for you suckers can't hear it 
The rhymes I designed, are right on time 
and at the crowd on my mic, flash a danger sign 
Cause I'm the Thriller of Manilla, MC cold killer 
Drink Budweiser, cannot stand Miller 
MC's cold clockin til the party's through 
then they tap me on my shoulder and say, ""This Bud's for you"" 

To be a real MC, you can't be obedient 
To be smooth is the main ingredient 
You have to be silky like a Milky Way 
To be able to make it work, you rest and play 
I control the pace of the rate the rhymes blowin 
Hydraulically jacked, is the way they're flowin 
Slow yes, just like they're awed 
The comparison is wave like the motion of water, smooth.. 

While the record is spinnin, got your fly girlie grinnin 
MD is on the mic, you know I'm only beginnin 
Rhymes fresher than fresh, never heard me fess 
Scored 110, on my MC test 
My rhymes are strong than Tyson, hold a MC license 
When I grab the mic, MC's get frightened 

I'm dangerous, I'm here to crush some bones 
Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone 
What I mean by lounge, I don't mean bitin, huh 
You mess around, and we'll be fightin 
It's alright if you bite, but don't recite 
because the rhymes are mine, and that ain't right 
But until just chill to the next episode

Thought they'd go back to how they were
Should've been honest sooner
Before things got so much worse

You made us change

Way back when I, I love ya 
You couldn't tame your mind I

Like a sigh that greets the close of day
Feel the waters' welcoming arms
Embrace me in the quiet calm
 
I can't hear what you say anymore
Just the sound of trees on the ocean floor
irresistibly drawn from the shore

[Chorus]
I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm floating out to sea
Helpless on the restless tide
That flows between you and me
 
Moving slowly as if in a dream
The colours change from blue to green
All around me reflections of you
In forests deep I'm passing through
 
In the swell of the storm we're as one
We're dancing in the morning sun
Could it be that we've only just begun
 
[Chorus x2]

Lying here beside you
Try to reach you but you're so far....

Cast from distant fires
Tired eyes so dry
So full of sand
Just remember that you won't take it
You won't take anymore
Please don't take it
Turn around and reach out to the shore

From this mortal seed
turning deep inside
there's a wound which cannot bleed
for the pleasures we have been denied
All you want to be only we can decide
Try to get ahead, but standing
Like a statue on the edge
You talk about a new direction
But the words fly out and disappear
High windows shine, the light seems like a sign
But there's a crowd down there laughing
But don't seem to hear
Oh it's the same today, always just the same as before
Can't be the same today, step out don't be afraid
You've got the right, got the right for more

Shadows sleep coiled in the hand
Cast from distant fires

Ephraim Lewis,"Back room parlour lonely sits and cries
See her with her head in her hands
But nothing at all in her eyes
Always listening for the telephone
But it only rings wrong numbers
Or whenever she's not in her home

Thinking life would pass her by
She opened up her arms
To reach for the skies
Her dreams they never came true
So now she paints herself a sad song
Colours it blue
Late cafe closing on the street
He's turning out to hide in doorways
Or any corner that others sleep
Empty bottle spirits he has known
A vision of a quiet face
Together they look like home
Thinking life has passed him by
He opens up his arms
To reach for the sky
His dreams they never came true
So now he paints himself a sad song
Colours it blue 
Memories fading photograph of years ago...
Thinking life has passed them by
They open up their mouths to scream at the sky
Their dreams they never came true
So now they paint themselves a sad song
And colour it blue",Sad Song,1992

Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,

And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born

Epica,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at your days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness is
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The still cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me,
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me,
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has began",Memory [#],2005

I prefer to be unhappy with you,
rather than being depressed without you.
I belong to someone, I'm dedicated to
Nothing lasts forever but you, you do

I prefer to be a lair just like you
To fulfill my deepest desires
I belong to someone, I'm dedicated to
But all that I desire is you

Long time, no see, I'm doing fine,
Yeah, thank you
That's nice, you look great, don't wanna know
What I go through
Hard times, much pain, you will never know,
No one ever does
I stay cool, will act tough, I'll smile along
For you 'cause

Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....but I fell down right from the start

Let's laugh, let's drink, let's just pretend
That I feel good
But at night, it gets to me, hits me like
A piece of hardwood
It's wrong, I feel fucked, can't play the clown
No more, no
I quit, find help, I'm getting out of
My own freakshow

Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....but I fell down right from the start

Big boy is calling out for help
Big boy is calling out for help
Join my journey
Come on, take a ride
Walk with me through the valley of fear

Nothing's wrong, I'm doing fine
Nothing's wrong, nothing is....

Epica,"If we could see ourselves, the mirror would reflect insanity
Instead we camouflage the flaws that lie within
Condone the suffering we witness as we mingle casually
We need to right ourselves, or else we will derail

Aiming too high
You are bound to fail
Patience is a vital virtue
That you'll never have

Don't force me to believe
We're caught up in the greed
'Cause I just care for me
To break it, we'll need everyone
Think it through: unite is the only way

A raging tragedy ignored will have it's justice, finally
Distress and poverty is everyone's disease
We'll come to realize for all we've done
There is a price to pay
Yet hope is never lost, there always is a way

Trumping the game
Is no easy way
Enterprise and discipline
Will pay off in the end

If we ever could look into fate's mirror
We would never have ended up here
We're distracted by every sin committed
It should always be ever so clear

If we ever look
We would never be here

Don't force me to believe
I'm never needing anyone

Who is able to break through the circle of life and doom?

Don't look back
Keep on track to break the curse
Take the chance

We can't undo what we have done
So show us now what we've become
Confront us with our viciousness
And our weakness
We can't evade our destiny
So show responsibility
For we all surely have a sense
Of our consciousness

To take for taking's sake
Will leave a path of loss and strain
And endless breaking of faith can warrant acts of treason
If you can't let go, you will end up empty handed
If you can't control, you'll live your life in vain

Who decides about what's true or false?
Who is able to sift through the treasures from the flukes?

The time has come, we have to see
That total wisdom is in reach
The time has come to color in the lines
We must identify the signs

While love and light are in their reach

Terror should never guide you

Conditioned as we are

Eating dust and breathing violence
Keeping all the suffering within
Let me be the one to hold you
Trying hard, remaining hopeful
Making sure your heart is free of sin

In mother's scorn
Blood was born
Where we belong
Our nation's torn
Passage gone
A war unknown to us all

See the rays of light dance in hurricanes
The essence of our life held within cruel chains
Come and see the day's unsolved history
The mirrors in the eyes are reflecting the fear
We can't hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
We are blind to the wasteland beyond

Waiting to see your conviction
Swallowing proud premonitions
Clinging onto hope that slowly dies
Standing in the ruins of nature
Caused by forces born from danger
Cleaning hands where virtues live on ice

In mother's scorn
Blood was born
A war unknown to us all

The essence of our lives held within cruel chains
Come and see the day's unsolved history

We can't hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
We are blind to the wasteland beyond

See the sands of time play with prophecies
We always end up losing to life's guarantee
Barren promises feed on your demise
The challenge to be free is a lost enterprise
We can't hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
Yet we all know why the cruel commandments came along
Forever blind to the wasteland beyond",Dancing in a Gypsy Camp,2017

Hear your name and I'd start to cry

Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game

When you won't come right out and say

What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do

EPMD,"Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric, its hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(don't sleep on the e) you see, something might rupture
I don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge, cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus, EPMD in town

Total chaos, no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion
Like a magician, who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
Its traveling the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening, plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the twilight zone
You're terrified, plus you cant bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the land of the lost
You start to shiver, but then you scream, my friend
Yo wake up muttley, because you're dreaming again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm strictly business

This is the rap season, where the e starts pleasing
Girls around the world no need to be skeezing
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case, a brother acts a fool
Ive got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor
(get busy, boy) like you never saw before
Rhyme flow, good to go, after the show, Ill pull your hoe, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow? ), hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffing
And my parents find out, then they start riffing
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the e, the r-I-c-k

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, heart rate increases
Its like beam me up, scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as aids when its time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once, then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, how high?
Because I'm taking no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
Cause you're a soldier, and I'm a green beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this
Bring your dog, mom, and dad, because I'm strictly business

Yo yo, you're still picking on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the sandman, sucker, because its over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turning and my so-called friends
They smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff, because they don't have cash
Like the e-double, or the PMD
He drives a corvette, I drive a samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith, with the key to fame
Never high on myself, always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back, fatigued? no, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxing
Or relaxing, just subtracting and reacting
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yapping and flapping
I lose my cool, then Ill start slapping and smacking
You wanna roll? then Albee start jacking and capping
No time to lounge, I'm packing and strapping
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and biting is illegal
So next time I'm in town, I highly recommend this

So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station

Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin' on they fans, they ill
Trying to chill, saying ""damn, it be great to sell a mill""
Thats when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

(So whatcha sayin) You wanna go pop goes the weasel
You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diesel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MCs duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me

(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say there's no business like show business
But if this the truth, please explain why is this
Rappers been around long, makin' mad noise you see
Still I haven't seen one rapper livin' comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover
I stick to underground, keep the crossover",Cross Over,
EPMD,"Cooling on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
(Yo P you was packing?) You know I'm strapped
Posse kept rolling it was hard to get with em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started spraying niggas

What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
That can head your mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Giving best wishes to the best MC
The E the D-O-U-B-L-E

Because I'm housing

Cooling at a party, no better yet disco
Head feeling mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move

To crush and fry a sucker MC like Crisco
Every chance I get, I try to kill
That's one less sucker new jack, who tried to act ill
I keep the place jumping til the party's through
Whether it's disco, hardcore, or rhythm and blues
Take off your coat, won't you stay a while
Check out the voice that is smooth and mild
It's like Wheel of Fortune, go on for big money
Come cold rock the party, and leave wit ya honey

Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
Treating me the E Doubl-E, like a stepchild
Well let me tell you homeboy you're living foul
MC's, you know who you are
(On the bandwagon) Why P? (Cause you a star)
This is the year that when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite the style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start capping
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
As I proceed to rock, the girls are clocking
Some brothers act hard but the rest are jocking

Because I'm housing

I come on strong, like a bodybuilder
Cast a spell upon a sucker, like witch Matilda
Deliver a rhyme like Federal Express
My intention's not to dis, but impress
For the ladies and gents, the money was spent
To see the E-P-Double-E-M-D (yes the main event)
In concert, not worried bout oos n boos (because we do work)
To make your body jerk
(To make your girl want to leave her man and start to flirt
With the P) Double-E MD Double E'n
I'm not skeezing, but pleasing
All party goers, also behind show-ers
Who like the not, fast slow flow of rhymes that form in my dome
Out the mouth, to the microphone

Sick em champ... 
Well I have a new dance  that you all must learn 
You may have seen the Pee Wee Herman but it's had it's turn 
Now this brand new dance  I know you not with it 
You might break your neck  to really try to get it 
If you seen the clumsy movie it was called The Jerk 
You had to check out Steve Martin as he started the ""Kirk""
He was doin freaky moves with his feet and head 
With his blue farmer suit and his big Pro-Keds 
Now if you want to learn it, it really takes time 
That's why I'm here now tellin you this rhyme 
And if you never seen it, then I'll be startin 
My brand new funky dance, called the Steve Martin 
Like this...get em Steve, get em 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em 
Get em... 
Like this... 

[Erick Sermon] 
Well the dance is def, and it's gonna last 
I don't really think any other dance will pass 
All the dancers out there tryin to freak on the floor 
When they see me do the Martin they try to ignore 
When they see my dance, they came to a surprise 
I caught the suckers ducks speakin eye to eye 
While they bitin my stuff, like I wasn't there 
But they didn't have the right so, I didn't care 
Sway your arms around your back, then across your chest 
Do the crazy leg sweep from right to left 
It's the Steve... 

[Parrish Smith] 
Like this... 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em... 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em... 
Get em... 
Well it's back to the man on the mic you see 
Because I'm stuck to my dance like a dog on a flea 
Now I know my dance is the funky dance comin 
Pee-Wee Herman (Biz Markie) was pumpin (but mine is jumpin) 
It's the Steve... 
Like this, sick em champ 
(Steve Martin's in full effect!) 
Sick em champ 
(Yo Steve's a weasel! Show em how your Steve Martin go) 
Get em Steve, get em Steve, get em [x4]
(Ahh yeah, Steve Martin in full effect) 
EPMD, strikin once again, funky fresh in the flesh 
(True, yo, PMD! Oww, yeah...) 
I be the P double E-M-D in the place 
(Yeah check this out P, I think this is the last record of the album... 
Aww we made it!) 
Yo yo what time is it? 

[Erick Sermon] 
Nineteen eighty-eight is so great, and eighty-nine even better 
And don't forget, to take off that hot sweater... 
Yeah check this out y'all! 
We got this funky track, ahh, yo yo yo 
Check this out homeboys 
Because we dope, the dope-di-dope-di-dope-di-dope 
The dope-di-dope-nope-we-ain't-no-joke 
No-joke-no-joke, so PMD!! Yo!! 
We ain't no joke, no-joke-no-joke-no-joke-the-dope 
(On the Columbo tip!) 
I'm the real deal homeboy, for real 
(On the strength!) 
Because we in there, yes we in there 
And we're outta here, like last year 
(We lost the bandwagon, because I'm housin...) 
We goin straight for the kill because you're loungin 
(I'm strictly business!)",The Steve Martin,1988
EPMD,"Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric, its hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(don't sleep on the e) you see, something might rupture
I don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge, cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus, EPMD in town

Total chaos, no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion
Like a magician, who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
Its traveling the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening, plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the twilight zone
You're terrified, plus you cant bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the land of the lost
You start to shiver, but then you scream, my friend
Yo wake up muttley, because you're dreaming again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm strictly business

This is the rap season, where the e starts pleasing
Girls around the world no need to be skeezing
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case, a brother acts a fool
Ive got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor
(get busy, boy) like you never saw before
Rhyme flow, good to go, after the show, Ill pull your hoe, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow? ), hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffing
And my parents find out, then they start riffing
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the e, the r-I-c-k

MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, heart rate increases
Its like beam me up, scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as aids when its time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once, then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, how high?
Because I'm taking no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
Cause you're a soldier, and I'm a green beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this
Bring your dog, mom, and dad, because I'm strictly business

Yo yo, you're still picking on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the sandman, sucker, because its over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turning and my so-called friends
They smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff, because they don't have cash
Like the e-double, or the PMD
He drives a corvette, I drive a samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith, with the key to fame
Never high on myself, always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back, fatigued? no, I'm not

Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxing
Or relaxing, just subtracting and reacting
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yapping and flapping
I lose my cool, then Ill start slapping and smacking
You wanna roll? then Albee start jacking and capping
No time to lounge, I'm packing and strapping
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and biting is illegal
So next time I'm in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm strictly business",Strictly Business,1988

Yo  what's up PMD? 



[PMD] 

Ayo coolin man  done with this album  about to take it up to Leon 

Wills  see what they say. 



[E] Hold up man  we ain't bringing nothing up until I diss this girl  man. 

[P] Aw  you ain't going to go into that Jane thing again? 

[E] You know I had to diss her! I told her don't mess with me  you know? 

[P] But why you gotta be bothering with that skeezer? That was way back 

in 1986! 

[E] Let me tell you how it went anyway 



[E] Hanging out late drinking a couple of brews 

[P] Turn on the radio put the shit on snooze 

[E] So when it's time to get up, the radio comes on 

[P] Blasting in my ear with the hip-hop song 

[E] Five minutes later I hear someone knocking 

[P] Yo outside yo, my stereo's rocking 

[E] Saying in my mind ""Who can it be?"" 

[P] It was me, the P double E M D 

[E] I said yo 

[P] I said yo 

[E] What's up trooper? I have a girl and she wants me to duke her 

[P] Why didn't you? 

[E] I woulda have been, only thing she brung along a friend 

So PMD (Yo?) Why don't you do me a favor? 

Chill with the bitch and I'll hook you up later 

She's fly, haircut like Anita Baker 

[P] Looked up and down and said ""Hmm, I'll take her"" 

She came in, I said ""Hi my name is P"" 

She said ""Hello my name is J-A-N-E"" 

I said ""Jane, oh, what a nice name"" 

It reminds me of a high school flame 

[E] She came behind me and then she rubbed my back 

She started moaning and said ""Yo, let's hit the sack"" 

Went to my room because she was kinda bossy 

Girl broke buckwild 

[P] And started playing horsey 

[E] She showed pain but inside she felt joy 

[P] Ayo she broke wild and said ""Ride em cowboy!"" 

[E] Three o'clock on the dot 

[P] Tired of busting her 

[E] Woke up in the morning to my record ""You're a Customer"" 

She left me a note, she called me the medicine 

Said next time you have to be better 

[P] Bigger 

[E] Stronger and much faster 

[P] And you don't quit, EPMD rock double

EPMD,"Aw yeah, vacation's over, sucker's still pickin' on a 4 leaf clover
As I say mic check
EPMD's in effect
Snappin' necks and cashin' large checks, as I flex then wreck
So E what's next?

Shazam, let me tell you who I am
The E-R-I-C-K, S-E-R-M-O-N
Call me a lumberjack, or a midland warrior
Doin damage to the world worse than the Hurricane Gloria
I'm serious, you can say I'm furious
You're sayin in your mind, ""Who is he?"" because you're curious
A rare rap style, not heard by the usual
You bite you get damaged, so my brothers stay mutual

While I'm makin and takin, emcees shakin and flakin
Pre-heat my oven to three hundred degrees and start bakin
Emcees like potatoes, beats kickin like Cato
Gettin philosophical like the Greek man Plato (who?)
Greek man Plato (who?) The Greek man Plato
But I'm the A.K.Ato flow, bro
As you all well know, I do a show
Pick up the dough and ho, break to the limo
Money in the pocket, Albee's hands on the ammo
Crack the Olde Gold, as we roll and stroll
Don't play bold sucker, cause you was told
Your spot in the box in eighty-eight was sold
So quit the singin come swingin cause of the beat that I'm bringin
Tryin to wax EPMD, you be U.G.-in
On a heavy narcotic, such as speed or crack
Because your rhyme's mediocre but your tracks are wack
Not fiction but fact black, believe that
Then put away your demo cause the brother is back
And get the bozack, E

As I sing and do my thing I might sing
Jane, or the whole shabang
But if I snap, during the course of the rap
P tap me on the back, throw the crowd a flap
Just to distract, til I'm intact
Get my Fisherman hat, so I can mack
Groove to the rhythm of a funky track
Like (""Yo, you smack me and I'll smack you back"")
I come correct with the context
And then next and flex and throw a hex on your whole complex
And then check for a second, yo, then say
(R-E-S-P-E-C-T) Respect!
For me the E Double, or the emcee rap goddess
Cause me and PMD we get ours regardless
So get the bozack, P

Yo, time to get funky and raw
Stompin' mud holes of posses (like who?) like Gigantor
Cause when we roll we come fully equipped
Mic in the hand, tooly, and spare clips
Like a detonator with no ticks I then trip or slip
Or maybe flip while my DJ's on the mix
Never lost a battle and if I did it was fixed
You must be sick of all on the diznick, like a jim hat
Your shit ain't pumpin and your rhymes are wack
'Cause you're a nickel dime sucka, who hangs with Tommy Tucker
Like KRS-One says, you a Part Time Sucka
Who works O.T., to be like me
The Capital P, the M, I'm like D
To slay an emcee, on the S-P-O-T
Leave without a motive or a C-L-U-E
So get the bozack, E

The MC Grand Royal on the microphone
Terrorist, mafioso, a.k. E Capone
I'm no joke on the stroke I broke so don't choke
No hopes folks, I quote note for note
You mind float on the rhyme on I wrote (what?)
And does the Wild Thing, like my boy Tone Loc
It's equipped with the kit that bit the whole shit
Don't catch a nitfit, because my style legit
Brand new from the crew for you no voodoo
A trick from the flicks master Wu Kung-Fu
Equipped with the posse and the time I need
Cock diesel like Rocky and Apollo Creed
So get the bozack, P

Yo, mic checkin, checkin and checkin and checkin
Scanned the crowd, then start wreckin
Either kill or be killed, in the field of hip-hop
Cause if you're slow you blow you get popped mopped and dropped
If you snooze, you lose, here come the oohs and boos
I pop a No-Doz, relax my lips and cruise
Past a pooh putt'n sucka whose all about schemein
Wax the P twice, you must be dreamin
Cause as you moan and groan, from the mouth you foam
Sayin deep down inside, I shoulda left P alone
Cause it's a fact, black, that when I'm loopin the track
To lounge in the Danger Zone, because I'm back
In fact, Jack, before I launch my attack
Premeditate my assassination and come strapped
Playin rough and tough, but when I called your bluff
You tried to post on the microphone doctor and got snuffed
So get the bo-zack
Yo, get the bozack
Yeah, get the bozack

Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack
Get the bozack, get the bozack
Get the booooooeoeooooeeohzack

Yo, I don't play",Get the Bozack,1989
EPMD,"As the wind sets the mood, it's time to let off
A sucker tried to play me, the E I'm not soft
I'm very hardcore, droppin bombs like Warsaw
It reminds me, back in 1984
When I went to a party with the master plan
To step up, and put the mic in my hand
Everybody was there, from junior high to high schools
Dyin to get busy, because I knew I had the tools
Then I got the heart and went by the set
I said, ""Yo, I wanna rock the set"" ""Yeah no sweat""
Kickin rhymes in the place, people couldn't take it
The style I flowed, the way I shaked and baked it
Later on I made a record, and got recognition
Everybody's jockin, now nobody's dissin
Written and produced by the new rap duo
Yes EPMD, now I'm known in school
I see the backstabbers, and the elderly creature features
That used to diss me, when I was tryin to reach the
Tip tip-top and I won't stop
To be the master, in the field of hip-hop
I did that, and got a name for myself
The image of E, and all of my wealth
I see my fake friends, but things ain't the same
Oh what a shame, I diss em
Who to blame? It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

Before I cut records I had dreams of livin large
Earnin crazy cash flow, the whole nine yards
But when I told my college friends they kicked back and laughed
Said, ""You better grab your books and take your behind to class""
They said, ""You couldn't make a record and expect to get paid
Cause there's too many def rappers in the world today""
I said, ""Yo, my name is M.D. and my style is def""
They said, ""Your name is Parrish son, you're like all the rest
Frontin you gettin a contract, but then you 'fess""
But when you heard my record playin, your mouth was wide open
Your head was tilted back that you was almost chokin
But I just lounge, and cool with the fellas
Like my roomie D-Wade, Top Notch, and James Ellis
I never hung with girls, only one and she was mellow
First name was Terry, last name Romanello
My records started sellin then P withdrew
From the college Southern Con, known as SCSU
But when I often go and visit they say, ""P bust a rhyme""
I shake my head and then chuckle, and throw up the peace sign
They wanna feel my gold and sport my Rolex
But P reply it's really nothin, and don't like to flex
And when I step up on the scene I always hear them whisper
""Yo P's not the same, did you see him diss you?""
I go deep into my thoughts, then I questioned my brain
It wasn't me, the money, or the fortune, it was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

Oh!
Now you wanna know me, before you wasn't speakin
Now you watch ""Yo! MTV Raps"" every weekend
Just to see me, the E, and the P
Coolin out on the scene, with Fab 5 Freddy
Back then you didn't know, that I was determined
To be a def rapper with the name Erick Sermon
To be a crowd mover, someone that cause trouble
Then I thought, and came up with E Double
I can't forget, how they used to diss
Sayin he can't rap, because he talks with a lisp
But I got paid, now you feel stupid
Amazed by the style the sound and how we looped it
Now I clock G's, trunk jewels, and star trims
Cool around town, and flex my black Benz
Definitely hooked up, with the system that cranks
Livin well off, with dinero in the bank
EPMD, is Erick Parrish Makin Dollars
Always on tour, so you can call us Rhodes Scholars
You saw me in eighty-seven, where have you been because we miss you
I dismissed you, it wasn't me who dissed you, it was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""

As I freak a funky style, to a funky fresh rhythm
I use my crazy def talent, that God has given
Me to flow slow, and still live large
To drop a def LP, and catch MC's off guard
Because my friends started buggin, we used to cool at the mall
But on the S.T., the Sneak Tip, they prayed for my downfall
I used to cruise by in my rock and always hear them mumble
""They got lucky on Strictly Biz but watch the next one crumble""
My father always told me to wisen up son
Cause if you hung with nine broke friends, you're bound to be the 10th one
So I cut my friends off, and P went for self
Me and Erick Sermon, and no one else
Strictly writin def lyrics to my best ability
With the crazy imagination as my only utility
Cause MC's around my way brag how def they are
But now they workin full time, and sharin their mom's cars
Always frontin to the girls, how hard you can rock
But you leave out how you carpin to go punch the clock
Yeah we came hittin hard, so all the talkin had to halt
But don't blame us, blame God, it's his fault
For assistin us on the mission of a point of no return
To do a crab MC, who did not learn
Now when you're hot you're hot, and when you're not you're not
And when it comes to funky music, the two rock the spot
So next time you see me coolin, bite your lip and respect
Between me and you sonny, straight up, I'm like death
I cooled on the Run tour, with Flavor and Chuck
Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince but I guess that was luck
I did shows in crazy countries, like Europe and France
Copenhagen, Denmark, and Amsterdam
I even been to our country, that they call Africa
Keep your eyes on your girl, cause P'll be watchin around the
Tick tick'n, yo check out P rippin
A new way to sway, cause brothers keep vickin
Flows and echoes, that sound exact
But you're rhymin in circles, and you ain't sayin jack
So take it in stride, by the way I'm still the same
First name is still Parrish, Sue's my girl, nuttin changed
You insist I act funny, but who's to blame?
It wasn't Yo! MTV Raps, the money, or Soul Train
It was the ""Fame!""

It wasn't me it was the ""Fame!""","It Wasn't Me, It Was the Fame",1989

""Now that I got your attention again I want to""

Party, party, party, party

Get up, shake your butts, feel the rhythm of the cuts
Walk around and strut, then a brother push up
And start talkin, girls and boys are hawkin
EPMD is live from New York and
Now I'm bout to rip house, straight up and jump
Move your body, as the bass pumps and thumps
This jam, is a crowd mover
For the girl and the boy with the funky dope maneuver
Or for a so-called dancing machine
Cause this record, is strictly for the club scene
Get Off the Wall, this ain't Michael Jackson
It's eighty-nine, it's time for some action
Like dips and dope backflips
While the girlies are movin, and groovin they hips
Enough booty, you could be waxin
Instead you in the corner, maxin and relaxin
Get up, and move your body
'Cause party people

It's Friday night, no work til Monday
To top it off you just got paid
So you step to the club, boys and girls are GQ
Before you go in, you drink a brew or two
Strobelight spinnin, people grinnin
You're coolin at the bar, drinkin vodka and gin and
Your body gets warm, your adrenaline is flowin
People on the dancefloor sweatin and yellin ho and
You see this fly cutie
With crazy hips, plus a nice fine booty
Your mind gets to scheamin, you start dreamin
The liquor starts talkin, you get more self esteem and
You step to this lady, ""May I have this dance?""
Then she takes you in your arms and she grabs your hands
And while the disc jockey's yelling GET UP, GET UP
GET UP, GET UP, and on the dancefloor
The ladies are freakin moves, you never seen before
Cut up shirts, miniskirts, the whole works
Squeakin moves that make you squint and say
""Damn that must hurt"" stomachs are showin, aces blowin
And while you're havin fun, spendin your dough and
You reach into your pockets, you reach deeper
And off goes your money beeper
Which means you're runnin low on the dough
So you cool with the drinks and you limit your hoes
You grab a seat in the corner, and play low key
Askin yourself over and over how you spent a G
Don't worry now, worry on Monday
And get back on the dancefloor

This is me, is this the doctor M.D.?
Yo P it's kinda early, who's there Laverner and Shirley?
Is it Kate and Allie, or some other girlie?
Well anyway, yo P you know I'm lazy
Callin me this time of hour you must be crazy

Excuse me, but I'm sorry E Double
It's a terrible situation and it might cause trouble
Throw on your coat jump in your Benz and come over

Why P?

Yo, I think Jane is on my sofa

What?

Last night I was all alone
Couldn't watch the boob tube, because my fuse was blown
Picked up the bat phone, to drop a line to you
Maybe 10:15, or maybe 10:22

Where was I?

I don't know, you wasn't there
Threw on the link Rolex watch and fresh gear
I grabbed my key, along with the cash flow
Shifted out the door to the local disco

Where'd you go, not to that ran down pub

Hell no, I was coolin at a club
It was Spanish night, so I was drinkin Molta
Doing a little tango, plus a little salsa
Seen a fly girl, standin next to me
So I slid over to her very non-chalantly
She was DEF, body perfectly fit
She was packin, a 300-E with the kit
I said, ""Kitten, how ya doin miss?""
I said, ""Hello my name is Parrish""

""Hi, my name is Cris""

""Can I buy you a drink?""

""Yes""

""What will it be?""

""A martini and Rossi, Asi Spumante
By the way is that your Caadillac Allante
Parked outside right next to my Monte
Car? You can call it, my ex-husband bought it.""

POOF! My ego appeared and said it's time to go for it
""This place is a drag, grab your coat and bag
We'll have drinks on the house, back at my pad.""
We got to my house we walked through the door
Threw on ""Night and Day"" by

Al. B Sure

She grabbed me, gave me kiss on the lips
So I grabbed the cold booty and caressed the hips
I got ahead of myself, because I wanted to flirt
Took off the G-strings and the V-neck skirt
POOF! my ego appeared

Yeah it's time to do work

I felt the movement below so it's time to react
I went in my back utility belt and pulled out a jim hat
I bust a move, when it came to that
But then she freaked it, and grabbed the bozack
Started doin' it, then she called me the master

You got bigger, better, stronger and much faster

At first I laughed, as if it was a joke
But then my heart skipped a beat, and I lost a stroke
I said to myself, oh no it couldn't be
The J to the A to the N to the E

Yo P don't tell me it was Jane you were douchin'
With the Anita Baker haircut

Nah more like Whitney Houston

EPMD,"The employees of the year, yeah we're back to work
I took time off, while all the rappers got jerked
Due to the fact that they're whack and their tracks
Have to go back and stack 'cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and Scratch for that
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I take a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in eighty-seven, eighty-eight you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glow (that's word born)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, kickin' microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies and all party goers
Some call me freak, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Puttin heads to bed, straight out the box
MC's, are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, so I'm vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
in eighty-nine, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance a bowl
What I chose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh my style is def, and as deadly as crack

While I'm slayin' must explain, a sucker is the lame
Battle in the trenches where the funky be playin'
Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
A kin not blood related, but you can call us cousins
Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like I'm Housin', You Gots Ta Chill, and more
The proof is in the pudding (yo check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we was bold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'

Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes the Boy Wonder
No fouls no bleeps no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""So amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
Cuz me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
Cause you was Memorex, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all out battle, P comes out swingin'
Cause I'm just that type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
and get mines on time that's why most resign
Sit in my LazyBoy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'",So What Cha Sayin',1989
EPMD,"Just when you thought it was safe to make records
The rap duo is back, it's time to start wreckin
E Double swingin high, I'm swingin low
Washin wannabees down, with some H20
As I go blow to blow, toe to toe, flow for flow
(Any has PMD?) Hell no!
I'm blowin rappers off course, like the S.S. Minnow
That's not your rhyme sonny, so please let go my Eggo

""I hear voices sayin that's Erick Sermon""

Straight up, right now, I'm on a mission
Front face the center and face your competition
As I rock, you jock, and in shock
And have fear, when the E is on the spot
(You pulled the mic handle, Joker, Joker, Joker)
Yeah boy, you hit the jackpot
So chill as I flex my skill and rap talent
Smooth hardcore, no time for love ballads
I'm not kickin the slow jams that's cool
But nah the hardcore, that make the brothers act fool
That's the way I would want stuff lookin
The crowd yellin, and buckwhylin like Brooklyn boy

""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""
""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""

Welcome, and all aboard
Crab tried to diss, now it's time to score
People, tripped and flipped, when we splurged our gift
To get paid off what we made, and also uplift
A new way to sway, or should I say flow
To keep the ladies screamin 'OW', the brothers yellin 'ho'
Now hold the O, and give me an intro
A kick and a snare, now the green light to go
I flex a rhyme on a rapper then proceed to wreck
By break this mic in half, then put him in the yolk and snap his neck
When five-oh roll, they say what's the M.O
Another rapper was hit, by Mister Slow Flow
Cause on my second return, I had to come correct
Takin nuttin but bodies, on the Unfinished Business tip
I make the music, that makes a posse ill
In they Jeeps or playin ball, or ready to chill
Or maybe at the spot where you hang where it's hot
Drinkin quarts of Old Gold, in the parkin lot
But mainly at a concert where the place is packed
Brothers yellin 'ho', girlies on the bozack
The system boomin, smoke everywhere
People swayin side to side with they hands in the air
A posse digs the music so they want to roll
So they troop through the venue, scopin everyone's gold
But whether you in New York, Detroit, L.A. or Miami
Approach with caution, cause brothers pack jammies
In they coat pocketbooks, and even they jock
You on the wrong brother, and you bound to get popped

""I hear voices sayin that's Erick Sermon""

Hurry hurry and step right up
The best show on earth, EPMD yea word up
And featuring the man on the cut
He who don't believe can get the (macadamia) NUTS
So whassup homeboy, there's any static?
Do we have to draw joints and get dramatic?
Or can we cool and be jolly old chaps
Or break loose, pull out guns and bust caps?
Nah, I don't think you want that
So I cool, and instead I bust raps
Like check one two, and you don't quit
And match a funky dope rhyme that fits
I say a rhyme and change the whole subject
And still flow, and freak the whole public
It can't be done, especially by a crab MC
Who came out the crack rehab
You must be mad, in fact, kind of rad
You not a smooth criminal, you soft and I'm bad
Don't mean to brag, I'm just makin a point
Some say I'm def, the old school say I'm the joint
Fencin, no half-steppin, straight up and down
I gets mine, so you should cool and lounge when

""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""
""EPMD is in town""
No words at all boy
""Strictly snappin necks!""

SCSU!
EPMD's in effect
Snappin necks n cashin checks",Strictly Snappin' Necks,1989
EPMD,"Yo, whassup moneygrip, it's the E on the trip
Not to Georgia, but Gladys Knight and the Pips
It's a one way ticket, to the highest plateau
For a smooth rapper, and for those that flow
So blow like the wind my friend and take flight
And ""Fly, Like An Eagle"" yeah right
You can't rock a party and make hands clapper
Cause you an N.R.er (that means a Non-Rapper)
So give it up sucker duck emcee you're not ready
To flex yet, or better yet rock steady
With the E Double, number one on the planet
Take it for granted, I'm in control like Janet
I'm in command, plus full of fun
But don't play me, cause if you do you gettin done
And that my son comes to one conclusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

Knock knock (aiyyo, who is it?)
The one who storms on rappers just like a snow blizzard
Yes the microphone doctor's back makin housecalls
To crab emcees, who claim to have the balls
To flex with the man, with the rep for snappin necks
I'm not the one son, so don't pose or make threats
The PMD, yeah Paid and Makin Dollars
Stranglin emcees with the microphone cord and make em holler
I'm like, Quick Draw McGraw when I blast past
An emcees ass, then trash crash to smash his ass
And play his ego, while I sip a forty-oh
And count my cashflow, because I'm on the go
And aiyyo I don't joke, and that you can bet
I flex a rhyme on a rapper, play his posse and step
Like I said in ""Strictly Biz"" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos, no mass confusion

Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

No magic tricks, Houdini, or I Dream of Jeannie
Or disappearing acts from here to Tahiti
It's a one two three count, and I'm knockin out
Without a doubt (Why E?) I got clout!
Homeboy you should know, I'm de commando of rap
Carry emcees no trees, across my bare back
I use measures, and yes all are drastic
For me the E Double, cause I'm fantastic
So, I let you know, money I don't play
Step back and you won't get smacked, hear what I say?
Lay low Afro, or take a nightcap
And if you tired (yo, then go take a nap)
Or close your eyes and chank em like a Jap
Then lounge, as I rock across the map
Yo watch me go, flame dust in seconds
Me and PMD and the sound from our records
Check out the beat and the style I'm usin
It's total chaos, no mass confusion

Total chaos, no mas confusion
Total chaos, no mas confusion

Last rhyme was for E, this one's for the Gipper
Give me room, 'cause I'm about to rip a
Emcee's head off as I release my steam
The method of decapitation, is the guillotine
So check out the tempo, and let your body go
Cause a brother like MD's about to go Rambo
A Microphone Doctor, an emcee physician
An all around scholar, a rapper technician
So put up or shut up, cause MD is like fed up
You, your wack crew, your whole damn set up
Suckers still slippin, you better get a grip and
Change your wack style while the clock still tickin
Cause pursuin and doin a brother, is second nature
Can you feel it E Double? (Yeah, somethin like)
To the Microphone Doctor, all rappers are obsolete
You lack style and composure, plus your rhymes are weak
I gave you all due respect, when I said mic check
You're still slippin Duke, it's time to snap that neck
Like I said in ""Strictly Biz"" I'm known to cause an illusion
To create total chaos, no mass confusion",Total Kaos,1989
EPMD,"Yo, at a hip-hop club was a girl I met
She was hot you can bet, her body dripped with sweat
I kicked it to her, and her name was kim
She said let's jet because she was ready for the jim
Browski I doubt thee e would front
So like a real stunt, I rolled the blunt
She was ready, I could see in her face
So we stepped, and went right to her place
It was fat, she had a dope crib
She offered food, like some barbecue ribs
I said ""no thank you"" not now honey
How about some drink, yes some gin rummy
After that, come here and sit down
And put on tenderoni by mister bobbi brown
We waste no time, it was time to do it
Put on some james brown so we can get into it
No kinky stuff, like ropes or handcuffs
But when you love me please don't be rough
I said ""listen, I'll be gentle, I'll be very gentle
When I'm loving yoooouuu, when I'm loving yoooouuu
So I dipped, I abandoned ship
Threw in the anchor like on the boat tip
That's what I get for trying to be a lover
But never judge a book, by the damm cover
I'm not dissing, and I don't like fishing
But next time, I want to know who I'm kissing
You can call me gay or a tutti-frutti
But I won't touch it until I know who's booty

Well I was maxin one day just minding my own
Talking to e-double on my car telephone
When I seen this fly girl clocking my means of transportation
The look in her eye was the look of infatuation
So I put my car in park, turned my system down
I said ""excuse me, are you new in town""
She said ""it's funny you asked I just got here today""
I said ""yo, you need a lift because I'm going that way""
She said ""my mother always told me not to ride with strangers
If I did, than my life would be in danger""
I said ""yeah that's true, but I'm not you're everyday swinger""
To tell you the truth, I'm a well known singer""
Plus I was cold coolin
40 dog in lap
Rings on my fingers with my fisherman hat
She got in and said ""yo I never done this before""
I had to play my cards right to get my foot in the door
I said yeah, my name is parish but they call me md
For the way I hold the mic, and slay mc's
She was lost and replied ""you a medical doctor?""
I said ""close but no cigar, I'm the microphone doctor
Who performs open surgery, on mc's who are willing
Except to try same them, I try to kill them""
She said ""ooh that sounds exciting, please tell me more""
You mean how we pack concerts and clock 10 g's or more
We pulled up to her house and her moms wasn't home
And as we got to the door she sparked up the homegrown
I was with it, felling nice from old e
Ready to get busy, and wax a cold booty
We got to her room, it was time to max
Pulled out the jim hat and strapped the bozak
I hit the lights, and next was the sack
We started doing it, it was hard to produce
Because the booty was cold kickin like they call me bruce
I had to cover my nose, not to ruin the mood
Because I know I wasn't fishing but I smelled seafood
Smelled like shrimp or lobster, or tuna of the sea
And it wasn't worth catching the a-the I-the d-to the s-oh yes
The s is for safe sex
And as I glanced at the door, you that move was next
But she pulled me close, and said ""let's get loose""
And out of nowhere I yelled ""baby did you do""
She said no p, cause I'm not a swinger
I couldn't buy that as I smelled my forefinger
I was playing myself plus my style was cramped
I grabbed my keys and coat, and md broke camp
And as I walked to the door, the girl got moody
I looked her eye to eye and said ""who's booty?""",Who's Booty,1989
EPMD,"Aiyyo whassup E man?

We took a seat at the bar

Feelin brand new

Frank ordered drinks, no liquor

Just plain old brew

He finished it

Then he ordered one more

And another

And another

And that made four

He seen this fly girlie

Suave and deboinaire

Light skinned complexion

With long black hair

But this girl was ug-ly

I mean her body was through

But after four drinks or more

She looked like Paula Abdul

You know what baby? You startin to look good
You startin to look REAL good
You startin to remind me of that superstar, Paula Abdul

The party was over

It was time to go

You insisted on drivin

When we said no

Are you kidding me man?
That stuff in there, that stuff in there taste like fruit punch
I could drink that all night

So you got in your car

Swervin on the road

There was a cop in the bushes

On radar patrol

The light turned green

And you decided to stop

By the time I got to Motor Vehicle, Motor Vehicle was closed

You continued to drink
When you know you should stop
The next thing you know
Your behind is caught
Your body gets numb
So you slow up the pace
Your mouth gets watery
And you can't feel your face
You finally make it home
And the fun begins
You try to pass out
But here comes the spins
So you turn and toss
Then you toss and turn
Your head gets light
And your chest starts to burn
So you lay on your stomach
And you tuck in your chin
Pail by your bedside
Now the breathing begins

Oh, oh God, just let me get through this last one
If you let me make it
If you let me make it through the night God
I promise I'll never have another drink again
I'll never drink again, as long as I live

Cause ain't nuttin cool about chillin in a coffin six feet under
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, this is Frank B
And learn from others mistakes homes!

And don't let peer pressure get to you
Cause it costs you, or your life, or somebody else's life
In the long run

And it's like that
And if you don't believe you can get the bozack

See-ya!

[Featuring Redman] 
Chorus: Parrish Smith (from 'So What Cha Sayin') 
Brothers on my jock for the way I hold a piece of steel (4x) 
So what cha saying 
Verse One: Redman 
I go wild as I sip from a cold Lowenbrau 
Set up rhymes like fire to gunpowder 
Boom  did the bassline crank 
From being rated are  from being top rank 
I'm hard like an erection 
Phrases might get too tough to break down in sections 
So I grab a pen and pad, I'm back 
to make a killer, similar to a backstab 
Don't arrest me, arrest my brain, it's insane 
If I'm booty, then I've been framed 
By an MC, who can't be the are-E-D 
Fuck wit me, you'll get slapped up and capped up easy 
By me and a tre-eight pistol, so vacate the premises 
Or ask for Mayday, Mayday 
For H-E-L-P, brothers tell me 
I'm electrifyin, similar to round three 
I don't brag and boast but smash and roast 
MC's wit degrees from here to the West Coast 
I'm miracle wit no abrakadaba 
Piece of membranes will smash like crackers 
Were they Ritz, Saltine, or Town House 
None of the above get caught wit the roundhouse 
Kick, blackflip, semifull 
My vocal chord prove my pull ain't bull 
I'm down wit the Squad, no more than four to five brothers 
Six or more, you seen got smothered 
By a fist of fury, next is the verdict 
Let's hear it from the jury 
Chorus 
Verse Two: PMD 
I'm a nightmare to rappers, terror to an MC 
Cold wreck the nigga wit the help of E-D 
Aggravation, don't need it, so get off my dick 
Master of disaster, no time for flicks 
Straight up be	-boy, Real McCoy like Bruce Leroy 
Strap the bozack when I'm stabbin a skeezoid 
Gangsta rap, it's Daddy Mack wit a bozack 
Roy the funk punk pumps skunk like a smokestack 
So swing low and lick up balls 
I'm like Scharzenegger, correcting shit in Total Re- 
call up E-D and the posse that's ten deep 
To wax a sucker nigga booty rappin MC 
So step off cause you gets no props 
So stick the fork in him, Redman (why) cause he's done 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Erick Sermon 
I'm E-D, I belong wit the A-Team 
A one man wreckin machine, by all means 
Necessary, I destroyed on contact 
No fear, of getting killed cause I'm strapped 
The Hit Squad's deep, making it sweet 
to creep, on my crew so you don't sleep 
My mic is caffeine, similar to Maxwell 
Making it smooth for me, yes, to wax well 
And you might get scared and spark a stove 
Cause I pack steel but Hold On like En Vogue 
My swiftness, I got a gift not for Christmas 
God bless, mmm-hmm, can I get a witness 
I'm fresh like a bag of Chips Ahoy 
No toy, I'm a hardcore be	-boy 
Once again, I quote, I'm danger 
I smoked Smokey the Bear and killed the forest ranger 
Poof, the fire's out and I'm gone 
Peace to Mandela and Farrakhan

I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10 more menace
And I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash, you ain't seen shit yet

Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately

I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
'Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin'
You should hope that disco appearance like broke

Mass destruction when I start crushin' and bustin'
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin'
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shits thick

I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by U.S.A. and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin' necks, bustin' caps and breakin' jaws

It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
To whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in the wrong camp, punk, stepped on a land mine

Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brent wood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some bullshit charge, mugshot on file

For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a Tech Nine
Yes the brother's back with no knife or axe
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack

Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene

That's James Bond, 007, with guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day
I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from wack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV

A show, mainly for the black

As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill
Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy
Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence
Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am
'Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored
And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel
Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours 'cause I'm going for mine
That's why I

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

Got to give the people
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

Why is that when wrong is done by the black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors
One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So (Fight the Power) and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned
So if you want airplay
You can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo",Give the People,1990
EPMD,"[Erick Sermon]
Oh what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat
I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brain-locked, my whole damn head was malfunctional
Cause I forgot to co-sign a prenuptial, agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new jaguar
Fly kit, with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought, when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, getting more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talking to myself, oh you big big dummy
Just my luck, that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby, who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half (not the cash)
Oh yes, the whole damn bash of money
So I chill, and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture being in the street
So I give a fake smile, and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like I love you so much
But wishing, she gets hit by a mack truck
Next time, if there's one I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

Cause she's a gold digger [Repeat: x3]

[Parrish Smith]

The p had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
""fly girl""
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body (so what ya saying)
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped e on the shoulder and said, ""yeah I got's to get this""
(p cool, she could be a gold digger)
Not with that smile and that stupid booming figure
Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten G's on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up, and said (oh p you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs
Whip my five-sixty sip moet and bug (so did you flip? )
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""guess what? "" (what) ""I'm pregnant"" (pregnant? damn)
Yeah and the child is yours
So to fellas, who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows
Cause she's a gold digger

Cause she's a gold digger [Repeat: x3]

That's why, men in the 90's must watch themselves
(cause ladies of the 80's got hip and went for self)
(With the new divorce laws, which entitles them half)
That means the house goes
(the car)
You and half your cash
(what a price to pay, but if you play you pay)
(Cause women of the world they got smart today)
(They flash a smile and profile)
A pucker with a strut
(try to move in)
Knock the boots
(and got stuck, with alimony payments)
Time to meet judge wapner
(you try to flip and cut, but she smiles 'cause she gotcha)
(You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow)
(Said the two deadly words)
I do
(but look now, you lost the house)
The car
(eating TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment)
Boy you picked a winner
(but what goes around, comes around)
That's why she wheels the benz
(and you ride greyhound)
(Oh, just your luck, they on strike)
(Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike)
(And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger)
(now you know)
Not to mess with a gold digger

EPMD,"[Chorus] 
Hardcore to make the brothers act fools [Repeat: x4]

[PMD] 
When I turn a party out  all hands is in the air 
Some say it's chill  New York throw chairs 
The punk funk sound to make a sane man flip 
Girls rush the stage  fagots cold dip 
Low to avoid the caps and blows 
By the gang bangers at the B-boy shows 
Wit the cops trying to control the crowd 
But they can't  systems crank ""So What ya Saying""'s pumping loud 
Blows are thrown, heads are flown like Pan Am 
Brothers licking off like the son of Sam and 
The bass continues to thump 
Some brothers hit the parking lot to go pop trunks 
Hoes are slapped, jewels are snatched 
Brothers are caught in the cross fire without no caps 
And on my way out, I heard a sucker scream and shout 
""Niggas, Niggas"", yea, cold turn the party out 

[Chorus]

[E Double] 
Rap combat squares sat and I attack 
Any crab MC that's down wit the wack 
And I wreck and if I can not snap a neck 
Throw a knock, I'll blow and look for a tech 
I'm terror, new edition to rap era 
I can't be beat, I'm too sweet plus clever
I'm smart, yes, I'm a so called genius 
I'm equip wit the thinking cap they call? (Keenison)
Yo, wit that, I can break fool 
Especially when the posse is thick and got tools 
Make me feel good 'cause they got steel 
No blasters or cap guns son, the real deal 
K-A, microphone wrecker E-D 
The O, the you, the be, the L to the E 
Rocking on, word is born, so abandon ship 
My name is Erick Sermon now want some and I'll flip 
I'm far from a chump, I'm hardcore like Brooklyn 
Mess wit me and get your manhood token

[Chorus]

[Redman] 
I got it going on, ?(sister muck)?, next to flex 
You bet I drop heavy, so girls grab your coatex 
I catch fits when I blitz a rhyme grit 
And my lip gets to the point so rip some more fly shit 
Redman ready to rock ruff rhymes 
Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time 
Punk push a pin in ?(pilt)? so when I ?(pit)? 
Pack pistol posse flow some more pro shit 
Fe Fi Fo Fum funky to floor a 
Fuck a freak, words before play 
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack 
On a Q-Tip, I quote, I throw rhymes like a quarterback 
A monster, murder motherfuckers like Manson 
A madmen who mutilize men with 9mm 
Bullets ?(brobab)? brother back to back I slam 
Bread and butter, break beast to Bam Bam 
Jump off the Jim before I jack my Johnson 
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swanson 
Get a stamp dummy, I'm digging a dungeon 
Can you dig that I dig deep to destroy dumb dums 
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro 
My afro's in the house, yo, yo, yo 
Known as I live large, life will be luxury 
Ladies in Lamborghini's, love is like (lut) to me 
Nasty nigga, competition is none 
From Newark, New Jersey, knot hairs like Mike Nunn 
Shit, rap is still when I'm stroking 
Smoke wit shotguns but the sign said no smoking 
Cool it kiddo, I control from sea to sea 
Cut like Chuckie, plus style it top D 
Super mad lover, cool from the new schoo; 
Hold your breath, while I walk holding my jewels

We got 2 minutes and 20 seconds to get in and out of there. 
Yo, Redman Solo, man don't get in there and start frontin' man.

Tom, set the detonators. 

We 'bout to do this shit

P, let's do this... now! 

Freeze! (E: Hands in the air!) Nobody move! 
Mack-10 is packed, so don't break fool
This is a stick-up, real deal, real steel. 
Full cooperation and no one gets killed. Hey security old man, don't play hero
'Cause a hero is a dead man, and a dead man is a zero. 

Yo, hoe, put the loot in the money sack. 
You reach for the button, and then you gettin' smacked!

Check the quotes? 
Stutter, mothafucka?! 

One more dumb move, P, and I'm-a buck her)
Chill, E. Listen lady, can't afford to do time. 
One more slip up and your ass is mine. 
I need all keys and codes to security boxes, 
CDs (Jewels) plus money markets. 

Chill before I bulk like the Hulk, Bruce Banner. Yo Redman Solo 
What?
Spray the cameras. 
All men, women and children please hit the floor.

Time keeps on slippin-slippin
Come on, P, man, ya bullshittin'. 
Hurry up, grab the sack and let's do this. 
Pray for the Benz and haul ass like Carl Lewis
A reminder, a hero's nothin' but a sandwich, Gus. 
This is ridiculous
 Say another word 
I'll make ya famous 

I feel like Bustin' Loose!

It's the E and I'm smoking. 
Wild like Tone Loc  I'm roasting, bakin' MCs

Don't make me wait-wait
Because it might be too late, the punk might escape 
And buck while, and in fact, bite my style 
And I'm-a catch a bullshit charge, plus trial. 

It's my thing to swing, your first mistake to bring 
A duck MC that can't hang. 
Don't forget, I'm crazy swift. 
My name is Erick Sermon 

[Parrish: Yeah, and I'm Parrish Smith] 

I could act foolish, start blasting. Ha ha ha ha, now who's laughing? 
I'm-a let ya slide, but ya owe me, next time you see me

[Parrish]
holler like ya know me!

I'm mad

[Chorus: x4]
Here's a little story, I've got to tell, I'm mad! 

My life story I tell straight from the heart. 
When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start. 
A young black kid destined for success, no Old Gold, no cocaine, or Buddha cess. 
Straight up hard work. No sleep and no shorts. 
Brainstorming with the skills that Pop Duke taught. 
To keep swinging yeah, and not to quit. 
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick, with your punk friends, 
Straight up pussy from Punk City, my attitude's fucked up and real shitty. 
From the back stabbers, yeah my so-called friends, 
Who swim in my pool. When it's time, flex the Benz, 
Around town, windows down at the South Town, Cool J tape or K-Solo, ""Spellbound"" 

With fly girlie's dipping, brothers gripping and sipping 
Old Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and 
I'm just lamping with my EK shades, truck-jewels, obviously the man's paid. 
But of course not, brother can't get his props 
Like for instance, when I cruise up the block 
In my 560 lamping on my Metro phone, chrome kit beaming all off your dome. 

But like a sucker, yeah, you looked the other way 
That's how I knew you're on my dick kid, but it's okay.
It's normal, relax, your whole head's busted. 
Caught in the rap skit, ya couldn't be trusted. 
Cause my sounds pound from here to Okinowi (kiss) peace and I'm outie! 

[Chorus: x4]

Stay tuned to this last episode, when I rock the house and the mic explodes. 
This is not the buck wild style that I be using, in fact black, it causes mass confusion 
It's a fallout, when sucker MCs and crowds call out my name, 
oh what a shame I got  

I'm not a new jack, my rhymes are not whack, and in fact, 
I'm like Clint Eastwood, instead of bullets, rhymes I pack 
In my flow gun, so son, ya better run, 
Cause when it comes to hostage and prisoners, we take none. 
We move wax like kilos 

And when my jam hits the streets, the sounds explode. 
Watch the right hook, duck the death blow jack, 
I wonder where the E and the P's at

Can they do it again? 
You bet your ass, black. 
See you in '91
Until things get the bozack.
I'm mad

EPMD,"One hot summer day back around the way
A new kid moved onto the block and his name was Jay
Jay was cool, he trucked jewels, packed a nine mil
Yeah, and kept his Smitty's on his tool

Anyway Jay portrayed to be like gard
So we took him in, and put him down with the Hit Squad
His house was phat, full court in the back
Jacuzzi in his bedroom, a welcome on the doormat

Plus AZT, full house alarm system
One rottweiler, one pitbull, no one could vic him
Something strange about the crib, I had to think
Why the whole god damn house was dressed in hot pink
Yo Jay, where's your bathroom, bust a move I gotta piss
Three doors on the left homeboy, ya can't miss
My head was busted
Disgusted
I said, ""What's goin' on?""
I seen a douche bag, and Safety maxi-pad tampons
Left the bathroom, went back where I was
Tapped Jay on the shoulder and said,
""Eiyyyooo 'cause""
""I thought you lived alone""
""I do""

""Are you certain?
There's bras and leotards, hangin on the curtain
Yo Jay what's your problem, homeboy you look stunned
What are you doin? Put down that knife... where's my gun?""
Shit's thick, I reached for my tool I wasn't strapped
Left the nine in the car, right next to the jim hat
It's my ass, I better think fast real quick
I got a flashback ah from a Bruce Lee flick
Got in my stance

Don't lie
Kay I broke for the door
Tripped on some bullshit in the living room floor
Jay rushed me, I grabbed him, scooped him up in the yoke
Ah Shit
Kicked him in the nuts
That's ALL she wrote
It was like Rapunzel
Rapunzel?
Down came his hair
Titties popped out
And there was ass everywhere
Jay a transvestite?
Not quite he was more like
J to the A to the N to the E
Yo P, don't tell me, you went out like a sucker
Chill, took off that mustache, grabbed that ass and I fucked her
Peace, I'm Audi 5000 *laughing*
Audi 5000
Ah shit!
All of that real shit, you know what I'm saying?
Jane? Haircut, haircut like Anita Baker?
The whole shit. Yo E, the whole shit, you know what I'm saying?
Nah you can't man, I ran right up in her like Bruce Jenner
But better
Right in there man, I didn't even care, are you crazy?
Was that holdin' me up?
Don't tell me it was Jane you were juicin'
Shit, kick it E!",Jane 3,1990
