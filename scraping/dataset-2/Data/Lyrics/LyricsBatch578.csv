Laura Veirs,"I felt my vocal chords weakening
I felt my concave thoughts
I felt my voluntary blindness
for staring straight into the sun
the romantic air of your eye patch
called me across the room
I clung there and danced with your silent
admired your divine tattoos

we slept in the shadow of a cedar tree
we made love on the rolling tide
we smelled the perfume of the waxing moon
we dreamt of all friendships kind
we touched the blood of the black cat
we pet the mammoth dog of tears
in the flickering light we were laughing:
""necessity conquers fear!""

don't lose yourself
don't let yourself be lost...

dreaming we were stones in black stillness
dreaming of the death of the sun
waking to a world of white blindness
painted eyes of the holy one
the death of the world was upon us
and the discipline of the wind
we see less and less all the time, dear
just look at this mess we are in

don't lose yourself,
don't let yourself be lost!...

staring at the entrance to the mine
I prayed for your wounds to close
tiger ointment and a cosmic collision
and the crucifixion of the rose
don't lose yourself, don't lose yourself...

don't lose yourself,
don't let yourself be lost...",Don't Lose Yourself,2007
Laura Veirs,"Now the raging of the forest fires end
And all the mammals fled
I smell in the charred darkness
A little green, a little red

When you sing your song
Your voice washed over the sea
Glacial land of
Beautiful blue light came o'er me
Came o'er me

Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth
Gasping for your mouth
Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth

I remember in the burning
A secret magic expense
A flame universe of bright gold and white
I treasured the whole fest
But it was too hard to touch
I flew out with the cinders in a mighty black rush

Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth
Gasping for your mouth
Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth

And the fire closed his eyes
Tipped his flame hat and slipped through the dire rye
We wandered romantic
We scattered dark branches
With the singing green stars as our guide
With the singing green stars as our guide

Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth
Gasping for your mouth
Drink deep, my love
For the water is gasping for your mouth (x2)",Drink Deep,2007
Laura Veirs,"Nightingale sing
Though it's blacker than the bog
Nightingale sing to me
I need to hear your song

Nightingale come
And perch upon my tree
A terrifying light's
Been flashing over me

I would not bear to rest
I would not dare to dream
Till the nightingale came
And sang a song for me

She'll sing above the blasts
And the clothing singed by fire
She'll sing above the black smoke
Rising from the funeral pyre

Her heart a field in bloom
Her heart a sacred snow
Her heart a mirror blinding
All the greedy as they go

I would not bear to rest
I would not dare to dream
Till the nightingale came
And sang a song for me

I cannot help but want
To sodder all the parts
Sodder back together
All the shattered hearts

Nightingale come
And perch upon my tree
The terrifying night's
Been crashing over me

I would not bear to rest
I would not dare to dream
Till the nightingale came
And sang a song for me

I would not bear to rest
I would not dare to dream
Till the Nightingale came
And sang a song for me",Nightingale,2007
Laura Veirs,"A handful of dream dust for my pirate
He can hear the pacific singing
The sea meets the light in his salt water eyes
Icy pictures of the water are captured in his frame

The paddles of night are unfolding
A mermaid's map floats by on the rolling green
Japanese fishing float carries my soul out to the whales
And out to the deep

I wonder 'bout the herds of the sea
If they will hurt or if they will help me

Swimming with my fallen blossoms
I drink from the source above (x4)

A handful of dream dust for my pirate
He can hear the pacific singing",Ocean Night Song,2007
Laura Veirs,"At the top of
Phantom Mountain
I saw the turquoise
Brilliant burning sea
The sweat on my shoulders
The silvery haze
Swords of lightning
Hawks and Gulf Stream
Made me crazy, crazy

I could not tell the truth
I could not tell the truth
From the mirage, from the mirage

Yellow butterfly
On the rocky path below
Fluttering lifeless
In the shimmering glow
Of the Phantom Mountain
Took her heartache
Took her beautiful face
To a distant place

I could not tell the truth
I could not tell the truth
From the mirage, from the mirage

I could not tell the truth
I could not tell the truth
From the mirage, from the mirage",Phantom Mountain,2007
Laura Veirs,"Sorry I was cruel, I was protecting myself
Drifting along with my swords out flying
Tattering my own cells and I tattered yours, too
Took you and rocked you around me like a spell

Oh, how now the cold seeps in, oh
Oh, how now I cast you into the wind

Wracked by winter, I'm cupping my coals in the sand
Growing like a starlight 'cross the garden of night, I'll think
Bones look lonely, memories surround me
Good times, skeletons are kicking at the ground

Oh, how the night drags on, oh
But I think I see a pink light and the coming of dawn
Oh, how the night drags on, oh
But in the fading of the constellations, I am growing strong
In the fading of the constellations, I am growing strong
In the fading of the constellations, I am growing strong",Pink Light,2007
Laura Veirs,"A strange July
a storm came down
from the North and pulled out the salt
and it tore out the leaves from the pear tree
my canopy

In the twigs and the bugs of sow
I knew somehow i was free
I held a stone above my bones
i was shaking

In the blue stained glass church
you gathered up my heart
soldered together all the tiny, shattered parts
I said ""All I can see in front of me
is the armpit of a crow""
you closed the wing
opened the door
and you ran into the summer yard

'Cause the sun's been known to shine on our wandering kind
yeah, the sun's been known to shine on our wandering kind

Clocking on her wooden board
the tattooed girl took up her swords
and plunged them down into the earth
a twinkling tide filled up her eyes
and poured out to the lawn
we made a raft out of the scraps of her skirt
and sailed 'til dawn

'Cause the sun's been known to shine on our wandering kind
yeah, the sun's been known to shine on our wandering kind
(Repeat)

Our wandering kind (fade out)",Wandering Kind,2007
Laura Veirs,"Looting the destroyed
Vessels of the sea
I wondered if the waves
Had taken all of me
All of me back
Down to the black
Down to the where the worms reign silent and green
Silent

We can do some wrecking here
Til a little color
Comes into your face
We can do some wrecking here
And find something to love
In this broken place
This broken place

And the king is a hand
And slaps you like a wave
And shackles you down
Bound like an anchored chain in the sand
Sends your ships to the rocks
Sends the keys to the lock of the chain
On your heart
To the mouth of a serpent
And his scaly glass shards

He's holding all the cards
And waiting in the waves
With the poker face
And no trail to trace
No trail to trace

Til a little color comes into your face

And find something to love

Laura Veirs,"Oh I can see your tracks
But I won't follow them
I'll just hope for rain
Or some kind of crazy wind
To erase them
And chase them into oblivion

Oh I can smell the smoke
From your fire, babe
But I'll leave you alone
And sleep in this lonely cave
And pray for
A storm to scrub this dirt away

Oh I can hear the snakes
Creeping cross the scene
I'm quaking in my boots
But you won't hear me scream
You're half way
Down to New Orleans
You're half way
Down to New Orleans",I Can See Your Tracks,2010

The blood inside the maple tree

That stays in tune through a thousand blooms

It's gonna take a long, long time

Laura Veirs,"Down among the dead the wide-eyed
And the legless only half ahead
Half a mouth to laugh in the porthole
With the mold and faded epitaphs

Will you evermore tie up my hair with velvet bows
Will you evermore pull out the splinters from my toes
I don't think so

Out in the hornet rain the swarming stingers
Pumping poison through my veins
Lying on the star-cross lovers map
Take the beating, lash, lash for lash

Will we evermore kiss on the boardwalk's fading rail
In the light of the waves and the comet's waning tail
I don't think so

Looking back, faded epitaph

In February’s dark

Explode until day break

How can you stand right there
And be a thousand miles away?

On the Northern route
When it grows darkest
The stars come out

They've beaten you down
And you can't get up
Stolen your horses
And they smashed your cup
Look up above
There can be no doubt
When it grows darkest
The stars come out

You harness the light
The lookout glows
Gather the children
And hold them close
And teach of love (teach of love)
And peace devout (and peace devout)
When it grows darkest
The stars come out

And how can I call this home
Its more like a BNB with no rooms in
Telling man close but I'm not not over the smoke
I could walk into a room and choke
Takes me back when there was no hope
We would sit with the curtains closed
So the bailiffs wouldn't think anyone's home

I was gonna write this down and send it to you in the post
But I needed the music I want you to feel this one in your soul

Just because you call somebody your son does not mean you can rob them
And I don't even wanna go there but who the fuck beats up children
Anyway that's not helping
What's done is done we kept moving
In a totally different direction
You brought her up to be daddy's girl
But now daddy blames the recession
And that's why hes out shoplifting
And that's my little sister
I can't stand the fact that we are drifting
We're completely different
Even though we share the same upbringing

Whitney Houston was singing, ""Your love is my love""
I couldn't picture anything changing

This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

Lauren Agnelli,"A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long, lonely day
I walk the avenue
And hope I run into
The welcome sight of you coming my way
Chorus
I'll stop just across from your door
But, you're never home anymore
So there, in my room
And there, in my gloom
I'll cry, tears of good-bye

Till you come back to me
That's the way it will be
Everyday in the life of a fool.

I get ideas, I get ideas

Those devil lips that know so well when I am lying

I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire
Just like a torch, you set my soul within me burning
I must go on along the road, no returning
And though it burns me, it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you, my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave; I want to be...

Don't pity me, don't pity me
Give me your lips - the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight, devil take tomorrow

Lauren Agnelli,"Stranger beware
There's love in the air
Under paris skies
Try to be smart
And don't let your heart catch on fire
Love becomes king
The moment it's spring
Under paris skies
Lonely hearts meet
Somewhere on the streets of desire

Parisian love can bloom
High in a skylight room
Or in a gay cafe where hundreds of people can see


I wasn't smart
And I lost my heart
Under paris skies
Don't ever be
A heartbroken stranger like me


Oh I fell in love
Yes I was a fool
For paris can be
So beautifully cruel
Paris is just a gay coquette
Who longs to love and then regret
Stranger beware
There's love in the air


Just look and see
What happened to me
Under paris skies
Watch what you do
The same thing can happen to you

Will your answer really change things

Who called you pretty
He’d walk every day, couple miles out of his way
To hold your hand and keep you company
Your mama said, don’t call it love at fourteen
But sittin’ on that front porch swing

He gave you his picture in a locket
That you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart
So you would not forget
The way it felt when he held your hand
And you swore that you would never take it off
And the butterflies you felt said it all
You were falling for the boy inside your locket

Back in forty three, the brown-eyed boy went overseas
And had to leave town for a little while
He swore he’d marry you
As soon as the war was through
You would be his wife
Standing in the pouring rain
You cried as you watched him ride away

But everyday
You had his picture in a locket
That you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart so you would not forget

The way his kiss tasted on your lips
And everyday felt like a lifetime with him gone
And you prayed that God would bring him safely home
‘Cause you made a promise
To the boy inside your locket

Oh, sixty years you two had together
But he’s been gone for a couple now
And it breaks my heart to see you struggle to remember
But I’ve been writing all your memories down
And I stopped by today
To read a couple pages
Grandma, you sure look pretty
And you smiled that smile
The one I haven’t seen in quite a while
And you said to me, I want you to keep

His picture in a locket that I wore around my neck
The one I left beside my heart so I would not forget
The greatest love and the greatest man I’ve ever known
But it’s gettin’ time for me to head on home

And I don’t want to keep him long

The first days of winter
Pull out that box of souvenirs
To read your old letters
In that stack of memories

You told me to remember

Take each day and make it last
‘Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what’s in the middle

Makes me smile when I look back
To every summer
You’d forget your birthday and just laugh
And say, it’s just a number
But Sunday afternoons
They meant so much to you
The simple things were golden
You found beauty in every moment

Take each day and make it last

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare
It all began the day I found
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
(Papa, can you hear me?)
To try my wings
(Papa, are you near me?)
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
(Papa, can you see me?)
Amazing things
(Can you understand me?)
The things you can't imagine
If you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?

Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live, the more I learn
The more I learn, the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly, then soar!
With all there is, why settle for
Just a piece of sky?

Will it take me under?

Imagine going to court with no trial

More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls

The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby

Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)

Lauren Talley,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,

Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground

So many things I thought would bring me happiness
Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

Lauren Tyrell,"Here's the story of a lovely lady
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls.
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother,
The youngest one in curls.

Here's the store, of a man named Brady,
Who was busy with three boys of his own,
They were four men, living all together,
Yet they were all alone.

Till the one day when the lady met this fellow
And they knew it was much more than a hunch,
That this group would somehow form a family.
That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.
The Brady Bunch,

That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.

Lauren Ward,"When I grow up, I will be tall enough to reach the branches that I need to
Reach to climb the trees you get to climb when you're grown up
And when I grow up, I will be smart enough to answer all the questions that
You need to know the answers to before you're grown up
And when I grow up, I will eat sweets everyday on the way to work and I
Will go to bed late every night

And I will wake up when the sun comes up and I will watch cartoons until my
Eyes go square and I won't care because I'll be all grown up
When I grow up
When I grow up, when I grow up, when I grow up, I will be strong enough to
Carry all the heavy things you have to haul around when you a grown up
And when I grow up, when I grow up, when I grow up, I will be brave enough
To fight the creatures that you have to fight beneath the bed each night to

Be a grown up
And when I grow up, and when I grow up I will have treats everyday and I'll
Play with things that mum pretends that mums don't think are fun
And I will wake up when the sun comes up and I will spend all day just
Lying in the sun, and I won't burn because I'll be all grown up
When I grow up
When I grow up, I will be brave enough to fight the creatures that you have
To fight beneath the bed each night to be a grown up

When I grow up
Just because you find that lifes not fair it doesn't mean you just have to
Grin and bear it If you always take it on the chin and bear it
Just because I find myself in this story doesn't mean that everything is
Written for me if I think the ending is fixed already I might as well be
Saying I think that it's okay

I can't believe how I have fallen for you.

And I was not looking, was content to remain.
And it's ironic to be back in the game.

How could I know that I was lost without you

And I want to tell you, you control my rain
And you should know that you are life in my veins.

Make sure your game is true 
See all my time it could be spent with you 
So what you gonna do? 
Make sure your game is true 

Well could it be that through these Cartiers I swear 
Their stares a specimen smooth as Sidney Poitier 
Clean cut & dapper seems he's straight & narrow 
Tingle in the bone marrow ??? 
But I ain't that aggressive instead I act suggestive 
Bat my eyelashes make smooth & subtle passes 
Timed perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses

Amountin' all the words to do magic 
With all due respect he approached it 
And offered the roach clip as I respectfully declined to smoke it 
[Nah nah I don't I don't do that]  
Broken the ice his demeanor was nice 
He tried to freak it to my mental

Yeah yeah I know you got a car 
But we should keep it in the lot

Plus I'd like to get to see if you as crazy as you claim.

No question I'll show you affection 
As I proceed to lead ya direction 

Well these procedures that you agreed to 
I'm gonna need to know a little more 
About ya self and family [License]

You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself 
Gotta see the God within him 
Brothers getting changed real quick over nothing 
We losing too many of ours 
Gotta recreate y'all 

Yo  check it,
Knowing you the best part of life  do I have the right to take yours 
Cause I created you  irresponsibly 
Subconsciously knowing the act I was a part of 
The start of something, I'm not ready to bring into the world 
Had myself believing I was sterile 
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl 
Turning this woman's womb into a tomb 
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need 
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed 
But someone, I would of fed this information I read 
to someone, my life for you I would of had to leave 
Instead I lead you to death 
I'm sorry for taking your first breath, first step, and first cry 
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially 
Having a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me 
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family 
I don't want to, go through the drama of having a baby's momma 
Weekend visits and buying J's ain't gon' make me a father 
For a while bearing a child is something I never wanted to do 
For me to live forever I can only do that through you 
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun 
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son 
I could have sacrificed going out 
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on 
I'ma use self control instead of birth control

$315 ain't worth your soul 
$315 ain't worth it

I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer 
You said you would be here when it rained 

[Common] Yo 
Why didn't you stay 
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself 
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt 
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are 
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination 
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation 
Back and forth my feelings was pacing 
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it 
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it 
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust 
Busting, more than the sweat in somebody you trust 
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough 
And believe, having this child'll make us have to stay together 
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better 
Thinking we all in love cause we can spend a day together 
We talking spending the rest of our lives 
It's too many black women that can say they mothers 
but can't say that they wives 
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding 
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning 
It's so much in my life that's undone 
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one 
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from 
But I'm walking, finding myself in my God 
So I can, discipline my son with my writing 
Not have a judge telling me how and when to raise my seed 
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame 
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed 
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy 
So quit smoking the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy 

[Lauryn Hill] 
I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
You said you would be here when it rained 
You said you would be here when it rained 
Oh I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
Now the situation's made things change 
Things change 
Why, didn't you stay 
Why didn't you stay
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer 
In summer 
You said you would be here when, it rained 
When it rained, it rained 
Oh I, never dreamed, you'd leave in summer 
You said you wouldn't leave 
Now the situation's made things change 
Things change, why didn't you stay?

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2007
Laurence Juber,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Laurence Juber,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me,2008

If you'da taken an arrow and run it right through me. ooh.
Ooh baby, a bird in the hand is worth two flyin'
But when it came to love, I'd knew you'd be lyin'.
It could have been a finer thing,
Would have been a major attraction
With no other thing: offering a note of distraction.
come on, get up, get under way, bring your love.
Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'da started at nothing and counted to ze-e-ro.

Laurence Neil Creme,"I was standing in the station
being pounded by the rain
so I chose the last compartment
of a stationary train
I felt someone get in behind me
but I never caught their eye
but I thought I heard I heard a woman''s voice
whispering goodbye

So I lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and I stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
And although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
I''m sure I heard a woman''s voice cry

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I rolled myself a cigarette
and smoked it on my own
but it didn''t stop the whispers
or the smell of her cologne
Then she rose up out of nowhere
and her hair was full of steam
and she stuck her head out the window
and screamed and screamed, she screamed!

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done

So I picked up an old newspaper to read
and I noticed something very strange indeed
So I looked a little closer
and it chilled me to the bone

and underneath the picture it said

On le prend cet instant, ce moment, ce présent qui s’étend
On fait fler, fer les vents dévalant à pas de géant
On dit un deux trois tourne la roue

On se fait la passe, on se froisse, on eface, on s’embrasse
On se jette dans le premier train, on verra bien pour demain

Laurent Coq,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1999

I'll tell you no lie

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

Laurent de Wilde,"[Chorus]
If I go on my way without you
Whoa where would I go
If I go on my way without you 
Whoa where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joint's blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva'
Ties will never sever
You died tryin' to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin' in peace don't even stress that beef
Go 'head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
every time I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
it's all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his body's underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus: x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
He used to talk about the box in the closet 
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, it's ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' with that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin'

[Chorus: x2]

Aye yo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin'' nearer 
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes it's gettin' clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brother's bad scratch 
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rug rat, somebody tell me where the love's at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Laurent Filipe,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2000

This is the mandolin playing the melody
Here comes the man with the mandolin
Mandolin playing melody again
He'll cheer you up 'til your ship comes in
Loveable old fellow playing an old tune
He comes 'round every afternoon
Raggedy old minstrel, wearing a big grin
You'll love the man with the mandolin
All the kids foller, all the kids holler

Avais trempé sa flèche un petit peu dans le curare

Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Ainsi qu'il est fréquent sous la blancheur de ses pétales
La marguerite cachait une tarentule, un crotale
Une vraie vipère à la fois lubrique et visqueuse
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule
Sauf le respect que je vous dois

Que le septième ciel sur ma pauvre tête retombe
Lorsque le désespoir m'aura mis au bord de la tombe
Cet ultime discours s'exhalera de mon linceul
Parlez-moi d'amour et j'vous fous mon poing sur la gueule

Derrière les flots bleus de Saint-Malo

Faisons l'amour avant qu'il passe
Que nos cœurs tombent à l'eau

Au fil des heures
Faut faire les choses avant qu'elles passent
Qu'elles s'en aillent ailleurs

C'est sûrement la vie prochaine
Envoyer la nuit des mots vers le haut

On est venu pour quoi faire, faire
A quoi ça sert
Parler ou se taire
Travailler, chercher des airs 

Vous dire
Ce qu'on a déjà dû vous dire
La vie c'est du plaisir
Ouhouhouh
Ou des soupirs
Pourquoi on est là
Mais moi je sais quoi 

Je suis venu pour elle
Pour qu'on s'endorme ensemble
Qu'elle vole avec mes ailes
Mm, je suis là pour l'amour
Il semble 

Que dire?
De naître et après de mourir
De ne jamais rien pouvoir voir
Jamais savoir
Défaites ou victoires?
Et par-dessus le toit

Le ciel, elle
C'est la seule raison pour moi, elle
D'aimer danser dans ce bal
Sous les étoiles
Musique et mystère
Mais pour moi, tout est clair 

Je suis venu pour elle
Pour qu'on s'éveille ensemble
Qu'elle vole avec mes ailes

Apporte de l'ouest
Quatre nuages lents
Ils ont dû voir hier
Quatre volets bleus
Ouverts sur l'océan
Pousse le vent

Elle était assise
Sur le chemin de douane
Où elle vient souvent
Elle a vu c'est sûr
Ces quatre nuages
Et mis ses rêves dedans
Porte le vent 

Bon
Ce vent me donne de l'espoir
Et puis c'est un peu notre histoire
Elle a toujours vu venir
Les nuages avant
Pousse le vent 

Quatre doux soupirs
Traversent tranquilles

Un vent d'autan

Est toujours pareil

We move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.

When sentiment is left to chance.
No place to be ending but somewhere to start.

No need to ask.

smooth operator,
smooth operator,

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male.
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.

Face to face, each classic case.
We shadow box and double cross,

Yet need the chase.

A license to love, insurance to hold.
Melts all your memories and change into gold.
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold.

Carrément vulgaire, très ordinaire.

Puis on m'a enrôlé d'office,
A Pau, dans les parachutistes.
Ils voulaient que je tombe des avions
Accroché à un champignon.
Je leur ai carrément dit ""Non! Pas beau, l'avion!"",
Carrément dit ""Non ! Pas beau, l'avion!"".

Je me suis sauvé en Angleterre.
Je faisais le Frenchman, super lover.
Je me teignais les cheveux, les sourcils
Pour être plus brun, pour faire viril.
Carrément débile, je trouve pas mon style.
Carrément débile, je trouve pas mon style.

J'ai chopé la mélancolie
En faisant des chansons sur mon lit,
Une commande pour chanteur pas bien.
Fallait que je dise France Américain.
Ça m'a carrément miné, tout dégoûté,
Carrément miné, tout dégoûté.

Promoteurs, ils voulaient, canailles,
Que je fasse dessous de table, homme de paille,
Construire des tours de carton bleu
Pour que les petits garçons mettent leurs jeux.
J'y ai carrément mis le feu, bien fait pour eux!
Carrément mis le feu, bien fait pour eux!

Depuis ma chambre où je viens d’arriver

Je n’y crois pas mais c’est Rio 
Au bout d'Ipanema que j’ai tant désiré 
Je regarde les vagues, je vais chavirer 

Ooh comme pour un baiser 
Il n’y a de bonheur sur terre que si il est partagé 
Ooh Rio je n’y suis qu'à moitié 
Ooh ooh oh 
Ooh ooh oh 

Si loin que j’aille dans ma mémoire 
Rio jouait sur ma guitare 
Mais tout autour je ne vois que ton absence 
C’est fou ce que le vide prend une place immense

Laurent Voulzy,"Ça commence comme dans un film noir 
Un jeune couple embarqué dans une sale histoire
P'tits voleurs fichés et recherchés
La vie les a changés en marginaux blessés

En cavale, changeant chaque soir
D'hôtel, d'identité, évitant les bars
Bêtes traqués, une seule lueur d'espoir 
Ça s'ra la fin du blues
Dans l'port de Veracruz

Rio, Rio Grande, dès la frontière passée
Nous s'rons blanchis, sauvés
Rio, Rio Grande, le temps va s'arrêter
Pour mieux nous oublier
On s'promet une vie, sans blues
Tout commence à Veracruz

Vrais mensonges, rêveurs éveillés
Le Mexique est bien loin du supermarché
Les vigiles nous ont vite repérés 
Ça s'ra toujours le blues
Dans la banlieue d'Mulhouse

Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating

What’s a song if it don’t have words?
What’s the word if it don’t get heard
You can paint it anyway that you like
How can you get the picture if it come out blurred
What life taught me can’t be unlearned
And every bridge can’t be unburned
You can’t wait ‘til you get your turn
I could try to make it home but you’re still on third
Look, your whole life need a renovation
Yea, let me give you a demonstration
No limitations, no intimidation
I’m tryna live good, that’s an understatement
They say life’s about choices
In the face of defeat I declined
Put your soul into everything, never back down
That’s how you leave a legacy behind

Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating

So live your life and do your thing
Enjoy each moment, it could slip away
'Cause nothing is promised, nothing is free
There ain't no receipts or guarantees
When it’s done, there will be no severance fee
Just a far away dream you’ve yet to reach
That’s why you have to go all out for it
No half-time, gotta ball out for it
Full court press, life is the test
Can’t play sick, can’t call out for it
'Cause I don’t wanna fall, no skydive
Stand tall through it all, that’s a high rise
Make a something out of absolutely nothing
That’s the definition of a survivor

Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

So let me be like the trees
Where I can rustle my leaves
To join the wind in the sky
If this was all a mistake, I’d rather leave this place
Than be a breathing lie

Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

Just keep me shining like a chandelier

He painted angels
On the skirt I wore.

Wishes he was old
But he isn't.

On top of it is grass
He filled the inside up with dirt
And made the sides of glass
He lets you climb the steps
Up to the top for free
And look down through a little hole
Above his old TV.
But if you want some more
You pay to go inside
The tent that goes around the trailer
In which Herman hides.

When no one is around
He has an upright baby Steinway

Laurie Anderson,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings

Laurie Beechman,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's, it's de-lovely"".",It's De-Lovely [From Anything Goes],2007

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said

In the morning and started to laugh

It's drawn tighter and tighter till you're all that I see

So early on that morning, the moon still way up high
The moon still way up high
Though soon enough the sun would warm the colors of the sky
I lay awake I could not sleep or even close my eyes
And dear you seemed so restless too I should have realized

The house was dark the moonlight was inviting and so strange
I went out by the window to watch the morning change
And just before the break of dawn and bird began to sing
And somehow then it came to me just what the day would bring

   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   I know you tried to make me see and no I never would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood

A stray old cat did walk the fence outside my window bed
He stopped and looked my way and then he went without a care
And I wondered when heÂ'd ramble back or why he ever should 
But I knew that he was just like you and that he never would

   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   Those words you spoke now ring so true just like you said they would

Laurie Lewis,"'Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin
But he held it up with a smile.

What am I bidden, good folks, he cried
Who will start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar - then Two! Only two?
Two dollars, and who'll make it three?
Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
Going for three - But no

From the room far back a gray haired man
Came forward and picked up the bow;
Then wiping the dust from the old violin
And tightening the loose strings
He played a melody pure and sweet
As sweet as a caroling angel sings.

The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low
Said What am I bidden for the old violin?
And he held it up with the bow.
A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?
Two thousand! And who'll make it three?
Three thousand once; three thousand, twice;
And going, and gone! said he.

The people cheered and some of them cried
We do not understand What changed its worth?
Swift came the reply: 
The touch of the master's hand.

And many a man with life out of tune
And battered and scattered with sin
Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd
Much like the old violin. 

A ""mess of pottage a glass of wine;
A game - and he travels on.
He's ""going"" once and "" going"" twice
He's ""going"" and ""almost gone."" 

But the Master comes and the foolish crowd
Never can quite understand 
The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought 
By the touch of the Master's hand.

Stopping to talk to every horse,

Roaring up the highway past Soulsbyville

They've covered up the winding road

Laurie Lewis,"Nobody's love is like mine
   No one so faithful and kind
   Love that is true as the ocean
   But nobody's love is like mine

They tell me that you've found another
And now you'll be going far away
Why have you left me little darling
I love you both night and day

I guess now I'll just go on dreaming
And wondering why it couldn't be
Some day little darling you'll be sorry
For the way you treated me

Laurie Lewis,"since you first claimed my heart I been starved for understanding
So I planted a garden where none grew before
but the seeds would not take hold in this harse and barren land and the only peace I found was in the eye of the storm
(Chorus)
So blow big wind 
like the storm on the sea
blow big wind
you can't shake me

I guess I've been an optimist or maybe just a fool
to think that these storms could ever cease
But I just crave your touch though the summers were short
that always brings sweet release

though I can't stop my heart from grievin
when the next storm comes rollin in it won't catch me

Laurie Lewis,"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain,
And planted some pines in the sand.
Every day, I'd look their way,
But just couldn't understand...
Why they never grew, like I thought they should do,
I just couldn't understand why,
Now I've rambled around, this wide world through,
And today I just happened by.

Chorus: 
Tall pines, tall pines,
Reaching up on the sky.
Tall pines, tall pines,
I'll bet you wouldn't know me now.


I'll never forget, the morning I left,
The hum of the bees in the hay.
And the farther I walked, the harder they talk,
Now silent it seems there today.
There's that old red fence, we built inch by inch,
Surrounding the old family graves.
And there's that one bless'd stone, standing all alone,
There waitin' to join me in the shade.

watchin the wind at play
it's blowin the white clouds over head

this mornin I awoke before dawn
and I cried that we had to part

and straight into my heart

Chorus
the wind chases leaves that fall from the trees
and I come here everyday
cause i only feel free from your old memories watchin the
wind at play

at night my room closes around me 
my thoughts are all on you
the darkness presses down on me
your face is all i view
and I long to be on that hillside
the air so bright and clear
I long for the wind to sing for me
and drive my lone tear

Concrete at my feet brickwalls at every hand

Chorus
Now the Wood thrush's has vanished
seeking the place thats not felt the crush of mans embrace
the steep woods are gone now and oh How long to again feel the spell of the wood thrushes song

Over my head just a few years ago the poplar leaves shivered when the breezes did blow now the deep home of engines drowns the soft sigh of the wind in the leaves in the few trees near by

Laurie Lewis,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift,1999

And barbed wired boundaries

And we dream of apple blossoms
waving free beneath the stars

And now I am an old man
But I don't regret the day

That I'd forget the shame and sorrow
