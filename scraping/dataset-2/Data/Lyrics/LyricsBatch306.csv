Gerry & the Pacemakers,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,1981
Gerry & the Pacemakers,"Let me tell you 'bout a boy (girl) I know.
He(She) is my baby and he (she) lives next door.
Every morning 'fore the sun come up,
He (she) brings my coffee in my fav'right cup.

That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,
I know he'll (she'll) go with me until the end.

Everybody asks me how I know.
I smile at them and say he (she) told me so.
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.

Now if I call him (her) on the telephone,
And tell him (her) that I'm all alone,
By the time I count from one to four,I hear him (her) on my door.
In the evening when the sun does down,

When there is nobody else around,
He (she) kisses me and he (she) holds me tight.
He (And) tells me ""Baby, (Daddy) every thing's all right.""
That's why I know, yes, I know,

Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.",Hallelujah I Love Her So,1984
Gerry & the Pacemakers,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark

At the end of a storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone

You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone

When I'm away from you
No wonder I feel blue
Without your love (without your love)
Without your charms
Want you in my arms

I dream about you every night
Hopin', waitin' for you to write
Until at last (until at last)
I find, can't get you off my mind
(off my mind, can't get you off my mind)

If you only knew
How my poor heart yearns for you
Then darling you'll be
Ever true and faithful to me

So when I'm by your side
Please remember how I cried
For your love (for your love)

But to me the other night, they only brought despair 
If I could only see his face again 
I might've known where my baby could've been

Then I'll be afraid to dream again 
In case she's with another & he's my friend

Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""

Gerry Cinnamon,"""I don’t have to tell you things are bad 
Everybody knows things are bad 
It’s a depression 
Everybody’s out of work or scared of losing their job 
The dollar buys a nickel’s worth 
Banks are going bust 
Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter 
Punks are running wild in the street 
And there’s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do 
And there’s no end to it
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat 
And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster 
Tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes
As if that’s the way it’s supposed to be! 
We know things are bad – worse than bad 
They’re crazy 
It’s like everything everywhere is going crazy 
So we don’t go out anymore 
We sit in the house 
And slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller 
And all we say is: 'Please at least leave us alone in our living rooms 
Let me have my toaster and my TV 
And my steel-belted radials and I won’t say anything 
Just leave us alone' 
Well I’m not gonna leave you alone 
I want you to get mad! 
I don’t want you to protest, I don’t want you to riot 
I don’t want you to write to your congressman
Because I wouldn’t know what to tell you to write 
I don’t know what to do about the depression 
And the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street 
All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad 
You’ve got to say: 'I’m a human being god-dammit! 
My life has value!'

I got friends in high places and limited time
I got a long list of women who pay me in kind
I got different reasons for wasting my mind
but I don't need nothing when I wanna get high

But I gotta keep rolling 
Just to get by

I got different voices inside my head
I got plenty of demons under my bed
But I don't get scared 'cause I'm already dead
And now I'm walking 'round looking like I've never been fed

I tell a million stories
With no words said

Sing me to sleep, sing me a love song
Sing me a lullaby of days gone by
Sing me to sleep, oh sing me a love song
Sing me a lullaby of days gone by

Sell my soul to the devil just to get paid
I'm taking one last breath as reality fades
Wasting time on the streets where heroes are made
And now I'm hanging 'round your place trying to get laid

I got different methods
For wasting my day

And I'm turning twenty-nine at the end of the year
Yeah, I wonder if they'll find me in the blood and the gear
I'm in a little bit of trouble 'cause I got no fear
It's like I'm crying out loud but nobody would hear

I got plenty good reasons
For hiding my tears

Sing me to sleep, sing me a love song
Sing me a lullaby of days gone by
Sing me to sleep, oh sing me a love song
Sing me a lullaby of days gone by",Lullaby,2017

Make it go away or make it better

This is not the face I recognize
Could I lay my head down here for a moment
Would you sing to me like I'm your child
Cause I'm not angry I'm not crying 
I'm just in over my head
You could be the angel that stayed on my shoulder
When all of the other angels left

Make it go away or make it better
'Cause I am waking
This more then one should have to take
If you do this for me then I will promise
I'll make it go away for you someday

There are lessons but I don't care
Cause I just need a hand that I can hold onto

And so far away from my home
But tonight you're
You're where I belong

Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(if any brains you've got)
From those little radios

So Mrs. R.
With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmon's
Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes",Anything Goes,1957
Gerry Mulligan,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Gerry Mulligan,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Gerry Mulligan,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Gerry Mulligan,"I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began, 

Before I knew where I was at, 
I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one man I found,  

I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
Why did I buy those blue pajamas, 
Before the big affair began,

For me to try to be a fly Lothario,

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn there is no sunrise

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me
It's so good for me it's bad for me

I felt 'til you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

It's so sweet for me it's swell for me
To feel that you're going through hell for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me",It's Bad for Me,1980

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Gerry Mulligan,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

One more thrill
While we're still in our solitude
One more moment
I can touch you tenderly

Can this be real?
Doesn't it feel like a fantasy?

When the night moves on
I'm afraid you'll be gone
With no reason or rhyme
So if I borrow
A bit of tomorrow
Is that such a crime?

Why can't we make believe
That the evening has just begun
Close your eyes to the rising sun

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due

And then it had to be with you

And with you went my dream

All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there
What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring
And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything

You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try
For we whispered goodbye

Gerry Mulligan,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Gerry Mulligan,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me

Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Gerry Mulligan,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca

I would hop an ocean liner,

Drownin' out my sorrow

Rain pourin' down from a cold winter sky
Don't wanna smile and I'm too sad to cry
Clouds hangin' above me
No one there to love me
Guess it's just the big city blues

Someday I'll find me the dream that I'm after
I'll know her with only a glance
She'll make me smile
And she'll fill me with laughter
And our love will be like a dance

Gerry Mulligan,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Gerry Rafferty,"I stood and looked across the water
I had to get to the other side
Because I knew that you'd be waitin'
I didn't want to take the long way ‘round.

The captain said the ship was leavin'
And that we'd better get on board
I settled down to watch the sunrise
And wondered if I'd see the sun go down.

The sea was rough and the wind was howlin'
But I was laughing all the way
I didn't care about the weather
Because I knew that you'd be waitin'
I didn't want to take the long way ‘round

Then a stranger sat beside me
It was my brother in disguise
He said he knew where I was goin'
He asked me why I took the long way ‘round.

The sea was rough and the wind was howlin'
But I was laughing all the way
I didn't listen to the stranger
Because I knew that you'd be waitin'

At last, I came to my destination
The stranger turned and walked away
He didn't know where he was goin'
He said he had to take the long way ‘round.

I stood and looked across the water
I thought of what I'd left behind
Because I knew that you'd be waitin'

You started out saying that you knew me
But I've never known anyone like you
You said we thought the same, so I just played the game
I really didn't mind 'cause I knew that I was winning all the way.

Maybe you'll find it strange, or maybe you'll like the change
At least you would know there were other people living in the world

You can't play the same old game forever
Someone will surely cut you down
So if you're going to stay around, get your feet back on the ground

Just as long as she doesn't deceive me

And find that she's left without warning

Gerry Rafferty,"My daddy was a miner, said there was nothing finer
Than an Irish man who worked an honest day
From Steamboat Row, in rain or shine, he'd make his way down to the mine
Along the dusty road he'd travel
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine
He said he'd never go back down again
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could
Kept on walkin' down that road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

But when he took to drinkin' we knew that he was thinkin'
That his days were quickly coming to an end
He'd only speak of Steamboat Row, he said someday we ought to go
And walk along that dusty road

Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

And it ain't been easy trying to get a day's work done
But tonight's the night we're gonna have ourselves some fun
We're gonna have some fun.

We're gonna go downtown to the Cafe le Cabotin

And if get a little crazy, the baron will understand
He'll understand.

We will burn our boats and sail away
Ridin' high, ridin' high
We will leave our mark and say goodbye.

Now the place is jumping, the party has just arrived

Just to feel alive.

Well his eyes are rollin' and he can't even speak

And the people all agreed it wasn't much of a show

And if he didn't stop soon he would drop down dead.

Goin' back to that country that we still call home
Said good bye to the capital city, yeah this town has got me on the run
I need to spend some time out in the great unknown.

I'm lookin' for sweet inspiration, every morning noon and night
But these days it just keeps on passing me by,

I know you don't feel like making this journey, but you know that time is on my side
I can't go on living like a refugee
Way down south where the living is easy, we can look across the great divide
But all we've got is a pocketful of memories.

We stood on the motorway shoulder as the sun rose over the lowland hills
And my heart broke down, when I looked at you
Don't tell me you're leavin' me now, when you know how hard I've been tryin'
Darling you're my world, don't bring it all tumbling down
It's only the code of the road, and the sound of a motor wheel cryin'
Don't renege my love, don't bring it all tumbling down.

One more morning, yes another day dawning, and I'm looking at a bird that sings
Wish I could change my whole life, and just fly away
Over the mountains down through the valleys, through the homeland of the Celtic kings
Now it's just the frontline for the U.S.A..

We live in a time when the spirit of love and devotion is breakin' down
And my heart broke down when I looked at you

I served my time and payed my dues, now I'm sittin' pretty
Sleeping in a feather bed high above this city.
It's four in the morning, and I'm sittin' here still thinking
Our love's on the borderline, I know this ship is sinking
I still remember when we talked about the Southern Cross a long time ago
Look through my window and I watch the cold rain fallin'
Somewhere in the distance I can hear a siren callin'
Is this a wilderness or just another station on the Rock Island Line?
When I first came to this town with sweet anticipation
My days were filled with music, and my nights with conversation
I didn't worry, didn't care which way the wind was blowin'
Yes there was magic in the air, and music kept on flowin'.
I was a superman ridin' on a river
She always wanted so much more than I could give her
I still remember everytime we said goodbye when I was back on the road
I was a rhythm man, now I'm a local hero
I still remember when my luck was down to zero
Right now I sit and wonder why nobody ever comes to knock on my door.
Now life is bitter, life is sweet, life is what you make it
Your love makes my life complete, and I just can't forsake it
The time has come to travel on, yes now the days I'm countin'
We're goin' back to where we come from, gonna live on some old mountain.

Sad that we're apart
So please don't speak of my heart.

Whenever we talk she says hang on -- just hang on
Meanwhile I'm drowning in the pouring rain
And each time we meet there's a sad farewell -- sad farewell
She tells me someday I'm gonna love again.

Still tears me apart
So please don't speak of my heart.

Every day's an endless maze of dreams that fade and die
No one believed we were saying 'Goodbye'
And every night I think of you I'm still left wondering why
I can't believe that we're saying goodbye.

And when I wake up in the morning
And wonder where I'm going to
It all came without a warning
What's a man supposed to do?

Don't let your heart break down
Don't let your heart break down.

Don't speak of my heart, it hurts too much -- it hurts to touch

The real thing is gone yeah -- but I could be wrong.
In the morning when I wake up and itâ€™s a sunny day
All my troubles seem to fly away
Then I remember, and itâ€™s down and down I go.
I watch the rising of the moon
Darkness always comes too soon
When the night comes falling
Itâ€™s down and down I go.
Now I can see you donâ€™t need me
Youâ€™ll get along yeah -- but I could be wrong.
Day and night Iâ€™ve been soul searchinâ€™ in a stormy sea
All your tears washinâ€™ over me
When the truth comes callinâ€™, itâ€™s down and down I go.
I was dreaminâ€™ of the night we met
So many moments that I canâ€™t forget
When the night comes fallinâ€™, itâ€™s down and down I go.
Now it appears Iâ€™ve cried all my tears
The sadness is gone yeah -- but I could be wrong
Nothing is touched, I still want you so much
The feelingâ€™s so strong yeah -- but I could be wrong.
Time goes by and a love affair ends
Hearts run dry and now weâ€™re just friends
The real thing is gone, weâ€™ll sing you a song
But I could be wrong.

Gerry Rafferty,"Back in my school days acting the fool boys
One and one and one made three
And the man said come and cut yourself a piece of the big time.
Armour-clad forces riding trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didnâ€™t wanna be a part of the great debate on moonshine.
â€˜Stop, pay the priceâ€™, they said to me, â€˜take this advice:
Youâ€™re out of your headâ€™
Stop, hold the â€˜phone -- this has to be cut to the bone
Too bad -- I see red
I see red. I see red.
She slips and stumbles, twists and she tumbles
She always lands on her feet
And she keeps her face turned to the far horizon.
Wonâ€™t you come this way -- wonâ€™t you go my way
Her rhythm doesnâ€™t miss a beat
Sheâ€™s just doinâ€™ everything she can to keep surviving.
â€˜Stop, pay the priceâ€™, she said to me, â€˜take this advice:

Too bad -- I see red.
I see red. I see red. Yeah.
Now who wants a riot -- people should be quiet
Donâ€™t we give â€˜em good TV
You can learn to love a lifetime of distraction.
Youâ€™ve got nothinâ€™ on the inside, nothinâ€™ on the outside
All the way from A to B
I can live without that kind of satisfaction.

Gerry Rafferty,"I love you so much, but you're leaving today
Somehow we've lost touch -- I can't make you stay
You say I'll get by, but it's my head on the block
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

What did I do wrong, tell me what was my crime
I've loved you so long, now my neck's on the line
You pass judgement on me while I stand in the dock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.

So you go with him and say I'm to blame
I know I can't win while you feel no shame
For every vow that you break and every word that you mock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.

God holds out His hand, why suffer the gloom
Of a renegade heart in some lonely room
Our lives slip away with each tick of the clock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

",It's Easy to Talk,1992
Gerry Rafferty,"You get a thunderbolt from out of the blue
And it changes everything about the life you knew
Yes the storm breaks and your heart aches
And then life goes on
When a long time love just disappears
You need someone new to help you through those impatient years
And those sad days, all those mad days
While your life goes on

You know it's over but you can't let go
It's not easy when it comes to saying all those last goodbyes
In that moment when your dreams lie scattered in the dust
You find something you can trust
Love comes to meet you like a brand new day
Love comes to you all along the way
You're walking down the street but you're lost in space
And the future comes to meet you and you like its face

From a blue note comes a new note
And your life goes on
You don't need miracles to point the way
When you know that love is still the reason to believe
In that moment when you know you might have given up
Someone fills your lovin' cup
And lies beside you 'til the break of day
Love comes to you all along the way

A million stars shine in the darkest night
From across the universe there comes eternal light
From this blue world to a new world
Somewhere life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on",Life Goes On,1992
Gerry Rafferty,"Love comes with a new expression
And the sentimental moon shines in our eyes
Love grows with each new impression
Like an elemental tune that never dies.

But all too soon arrives the dawning
And I awaken to the light of love
The kind of love I want to share with you everyday
We make a promise on this night of love
Let's say a prayer that it might all come true.

Love comes like a revelation
And it changes everything that we can see
Love comes with new inspiration
And it show us everything that we can be.

But all too soon arrives the dawning
And I awaken to the light of love
The kind of love I want to share with you everyday
We make a promise on this night of love
Let's say a prayer that it might all come true.

How many times have you been lost
And even now you count the cost
Of saying all those last goodbyes
Something's come alive on this new morning
You're looking at one more day.

Love comes with a new expression
And the sentimental moon shines in our eyes
Love grows with each new impression
Like an elemental tune that never dies.

But all too soon arrives the dawning
And I awaken to the light of love
The kind of love I want to share with you everyday
We'll make a promise on this night of love
Let's say a prayer that it might all come true ... everyday.

",The Light of Love,1992
Gerry Rafferty,"So long ago when our love was new
And the dreams that lovers dream still cast a spell
When we made love we were together more than we knew
And we gazed down deep into the wishing well.
Every day was a sunny day
Rain seems constant now
I can remember times when your love and affection
Turned my world around.
We separate like rain in a storm
And the wind blows all our words of love away
When we first met you were so loving, you were so warm
Now we meet like strangers on a lost highway.
Our love story was meant to be
All those days gone down
I can remember times when your love and affection
Turned my world around.
In deep blue, old and new
Distant voices call to you
Alchemy, mercury
Now you're free, and you can be who you want to be
I know that you will grow now we're apart
Talk to me when you're all at sea
I will keep songs for you here in my heart.
So long ago when our love was new
And the dreams that lovers dream still cast a spell
When we made love we were together more than we knew
And we gazed down deep into the wishing well.

I can remember times when your love and affection
Turned my world around.",Love and Affection,1992
Gerry Rafferty,"One night, you'll stand again in the spotlight
And everything will be alright
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

You started out in rock ‘n' roll
You had music deep in your soul
Now you don't cut it like you used to do
Looks like time has caught up on you.

You've given up, you've settled down
No more riding on the money-go-round
A quiet life and a room with a view
Looks like time's caught up on you.

Holes in your pockets, holes in your shoes
Holes in your day dreams that never came true
So many years but so little to show
Nobody told you -- you reap what you sow.

The way you talk -- makes me sad
I still remember all the good times we had
Right now you're twisted and bitter and blue
Looks like time's caught up on you.

How many times did I hear you say
Forget tomorrow -- just live for today
You've burned some bridges, yeah -- that much is true
Looks like time's caught up on you.

You've got some demons still driving you on
They wonder where all the good times have gone
Nobody calls you, now nobody dares
Nobody wants to ‘cos nobody cares.

Another night, another place
Another limbo where you've fallen from grace
No, you don't cut it like you used to do
Looks like time's caught up on you.

It's caught up on you
It's caught up on you
It's caught up on you
It's caught up on you

One night -- you'll stand again in the spotlight
And everything will be all right
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

One night -- you'll spread your wings and you'll take flight
And everything will be all right
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

One night -- you'll stand again in the spotlight
And everything will be all right
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

One destiny.

I was born just to get to you

To make you my wife.

Gerry Rafferty,"Sitting here is really bringing me down
I think I'll get up and go downtown
Have a drink and maybe look up a friend
To talk the hours away and hope the night will never end.

Look in my pockets to see what I've got
I count my money, I don't have a lot
The situation is always the same
I've got to get out of here, this place is driving me insane.

Hold on, I'm getting the new street blues.

About a year ago, I knocked on this door
I asked my friend if I could sleep on the floor
He took me in, said I was welcome to stay
I told him then that I was going to pay him back someday.

He took me in and all he asked was a song
It didn't sound me when I knew it was wrong
It got so bad that we were drunk every night
And I'd pretend that come tomorrow night things would be alright.

The things you've been leaning upon.

Than the need in me.

And life keeps on passing you by
Magic unfolds when the blue meets the gold
And the sun comes to open your eyes.

Well another crazy day, you drink the night away
And forget about everything

So many people but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to say that it was so easy

And then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town

Looking for a heaven up high,
Working just to get into a state of grace,
We know we're gonna need it when we die.

In that summer of '69
And my heart was cryin' out for change
And I knew time was comin' when I'd get away.
So I moved down to that city
Where I met a friend of mine
And I must admit he tried to warn me well
With all those bad luck stories he could tell.
He said ""Take the money and run,
Take the money and run
Believe it, in this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son"".
""Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone
You gotta take the money and run, take the money and run"".
He was broken, he was wasted
He'd been brought down to his knee
And his heart was crying out for truth
You could see the whole world's sadness in his eyes.
So I took good care of business
At least as far as I could see
I could read the signs and I knew all the lines
But so many times his voice came back to me.
""Take the money and run,
Get it at the point of a gun
Believe it, in this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son"".
""Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone
You gotta take the money and run, take the money and run"".
I've been wanderin' through this wasteland
Where the blind go leading the blind
And the only sound on the money-go-round
Was the million voices waiting to be found.
I could only hear a whisper
It was comin' from the one I loved
And her heart was saying this can't be right
All my wasted days and all her lonely nights.
Take the money and run,
Get it at the point of a gun
Believe it, n this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son.

And if you try to read a book and get between the lines
It doesn't matter where you look; you're only wasting time
When you meet somebody else, and you try to think of something to say

But you said it yourself, there's nothing else we could do.
When the wheels start turnin', takin' me through the night
Out there in the darkness, there's a star shinin' bright

He said ""there's so much of this life of mine that I don't understand""
You shouldn't worry I said that ain't no crime
Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time. 

You need direction, yeah you need a name

After a while you can recognize the signs
So if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time.

Life is a liar yeah life is a cheat
It'll lead you on and pull the ground from underneath your feet
No use complainin', don't you worry, don't you whine
Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time.

You gotta die a little everyday just to try to stay awake

She's got the diamonds, she's even got the suntan
But she's a bright girl, she's got a law degree

When she was young she read the Gurdjieff books
The wisdom blew her away
She's got the money, got good looks
But the girl's got no confidence
No the girl girl girl sweet girl
The girl's got no confidence.

She went to Berkley, did primal therapy
She wrote the music for a series on the TV
She studied Rumi and Ibn'Arabi
She meditated every summer in a teepee.

But no religion's gonna tie her down
She loves her beautiful clothes
She's sittin' pretty livin' way up town
But the girl, the girl's got no confidence
No the girl girl girl sweet girl
The girl's got no confidence.

Little by little she got heavy round the middle
She wore a silk kimono when the sun went down
She wrote to her mother and she took another lover
She gets a little lonely when the sun goes down.

",Girl's Got No Confidence,1998
Gerry Rafferty,"Moonlight and gold
Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away
And one more day is born.
Tides keep on turning, while hearts keep on yearning
To be where they know they belong
All on a new day, you see in a new way
The things you've been leaning upon.
Moonlight and gold
I will awaken to a love that runs deeper
Than the need in me.
While you are sleeping, the new day comes creeping
And life keeps on passing you by
Magic unfolds when the blue meets the gold
And the sun comes to open your eyes. 
Moonlight and gold
Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away

In a space and time of your own
Lost in dreams in a world full of shadows

Down the street the neon light shines
Offering refuge and hope to the blind
Who stumble in with no thought of tomorrow

Yes I get lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for some winner goal
Yes I should know better but I cant say no
Oh no no nono nono no

The light are low when the music is loud
You watch yourself as you play to the crowd
One more face in a palace of mirrors

One more drink your sailin away
One more dream but its looking okay
One more time to watch the flow of the river

Gerry Rafferty,"We sat up talking right on through the night
And the day had just begun
Then you said let's take a walk outside
And watch the rising of the sun.
And over my head there was so much to see in the sky
Just that feeling of being alive
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away.
We stood around until the sky was clear
It was time for you to go
I watched your figure slowly disappear
As you walked off down the road.
And over my head there was so much to see in the sky

Don't let it go, don't let it slip away.
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away.",Over My Head,1998
Gerry Rafferty,"In a dance hall by the river, I was singing in a travelling band
Just another small town night, with a silver moon shining
I remember when I saw you, that first moment when it all began
You looked across a crowded room, and stole my heart away.
And we stood out in the moonlight, in the shadow of a factory wall
Music playing soft and low, and a gentle breeze sighing
And the light on the river was magic, yes a magic that I still recall
Moments come and moments go, but these moments still remain.
Remember how we met, down by the waterside
How easily we forget, all the love that we knew.
So we married our fortunes together, and we sealed it with a golden band
But somewhere down along the road, we could see the flame dying
Now an exiled heart gets weary, like two strangers in a foreign land
We reached the point of no return, a long long time ago.
Remember how we met, down by the waterside
How easily we forget, all the love that we knew.

He moved from town to town and drifted down to Mexico
Wrote her a tear stained letter, saying 'Baby please don't go'
Sweet dreams and miracles happen, but she still said no
She said I know that you can make it
I know that you can make it alone. And he said...

'Don't move, don't move
Don't mess that groove (baby)
Don't move, don't leave me down and out.'

He'd call her up and say 'My darlin' I feel so alone'
She'd say I just can't talk about it -- on the telephone
He'd say 'Sweet Jesus -- am I really on my own?'

Why can't I sleep at night?

Gershon Kingsley,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2003

So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,1993

Gertrude Lawrence,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship,1997

Gertrude Lawrence,"Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.",The Physician [From Nymph Errant],2002
Gertrude Lawrence,"Before you leave these portals
To meet less fortunate mortals
There's just one final message

In spite of philistine
Defiance

He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

I am free, cut the strings, I'm out

Now I find my way back home to a place I've never known
Was a thief, I was gone, I was a runaway
I will preach all I know, gonna sing you 'till I'm old
On my own, but I'm over you

Saw a town that wasn't linked by shores. 

And fatigues soon ignored, 
As your feet hit the board, or as the beat hits the floor, 
These are the moments that we live for,

They are the ones that justify, all the things that we forsake. 

You are not your job, and you are not the clothes you wear, 
You are the words that leave your mouth so speak up, speak up loud, 
For none of us want to sit, 
In evaluations taking notes for hours, 
We're all sick and tired of waiting, lets set sail.

Despite initial fears.

That sell weight, hammer close behind me like when you tailgate
I know you a snitch, I can see it in your eyes

Smokin a Swisher like I wish a bitch would
Listen and use your vision cause livin in this - hood
And sinnin in your division you think it's all - good

Niggaz that stay home they scared to come out shook
Mothers with five kids and all of 'em got took

Save your lil' craps homey, fuck it get drunk

I keep 31 flavors just like Baskin & Robbins
I'm here now, y'all supposed to be stressed, scared to death
That you gonna be next, record labels, promote the rejects
While starvin artists is closest to sets
And certain niggaz duckin me because they owe me a check

[ verse 1: johny see ]
As I walked through 5th ward, I saw this man
He was kind, but he was blind, I snatched his jewelry and ran
I caught up with box and said, ""I think it's worth a grand""
He smiled and he giggled and he shook my hand
We tried to pawn it in to haveg some for fare for the jam
He said, ""it's fake"", and I said ""what? "", he said ""I'm sorry"", I said ""damn!""
My mama threw me out, I called my sister a whore
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week I didn't need, I couldn't take it no more
Saw my teacher miss elaine at the grocery store
I waited by her car, she asked: ""why aren't you in school? ""
Put my gun up to her head and said, ""get in, you old fool""
She offered her keys, cried and said, ""please!""
She promised not to tell and give me a's and be's
I said, ""I want your money, grub, and all I can sell""
I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell
I knew she was a snitch, I beat her down with my gun
Got happy with the trigger, now I'm on the run

[ verse 2: juke box ]
Now I'm just what you expected, a runner out on bail
Hustlin is my job, and I'm paid well
I'm used to makin money fast, beaucoup cash
Try to cheat me and beat me, my boss is bossin your ass
Once lived sheila, yeah, I meant to kill her
Her teeth was big and gappy, so I called her godzilla
She planned for a party, she said ""bring everybody""
No jive, when we arrived we saw dectective ray mccarthy
He started haul-assin, my fila came unfastened
I fell and went to jail and came back as an assassin
First I start rollin, my pockets started swollin
Havin green is havin power, and you know what I was sellin
Now sheila was addicted, her face looked reflicted
I caught her sellin ass, then and there I should've kicked it
I drove up to her corner and gave her a grin
Asked, ""how much? "", she said, ""20"", I said, ""bet"", she got in
I drove her to a spot that was quiet and dark
Yo yo, turned out the lights and found a place to park
Now I knew the girl was ready, she started gettin sweaty
But all was in my head was 'kill the bitch like freddy'
I dug between the chair, and whipped out the machete
She screamed, I sliced her up until her guts were like spaghetti
A maniac, I stabbed the girl in her tits
And to stop her nerves from jumpin I just cut her to bits
An assassin

[ verse 3: johny see ]
My father was a priest, cold blooded he's dead
Hypocrite, I caught him basin, so I shot him in the head
Poured on the holy water, ""bless the dead"" is what I said
Then heard the demon screamin as his body bled
Now I stole from the poor, lied on the man
Dropped the dime, he's doin time and I don't give a damn
We're not really greedy, we'll help the poor and needy
We'll rock a show and clock some dough, then drink until we're peedy
Drove on the freeway just the other day
I saw a fine hitch-hiker, and I wanted to play
I pulled off the road, so I could offer a ride
She said ""thanks"", I said ""no thanks,"" and she got inside
Jivin as I was drivin, then I asked which direction
She said, ""5th ward"", I said ""we're from the same section""
Made it to my ave, she said out and said ""thanks""
I said, ""yo babe, like won't you chill and have a couple of drinks?
We went into my house, and I filled up her glass
She drank and got drunk, that's when I got in that ass
I banged it and banged it until my thang got sore
I said ""honey..."", she said ""20"", I said, ""get out, you fuckin whore!""
She put on her clothes, headed for the door
Then said, ""welcome to the disease there is no cure for""
Then she started runnin and almost got away
With no clothes I gave chase, makin sure she'd pay
Now she passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Red pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Bare butt-naked I headed for the car
The massacre was from texas, so I pulled out the chainsaw
Cuttina nd cuttin, he said ""johny, man, she's dead""
On the news they found remains of just an arm and her head
An assassin

DJ READY RED: Hey, yo D! What's up wit them cash registers and 
Shit?
WILLIE D: Oh, that's what the average ho see when she look at a 
Modern day man.
DJ READY RED: Ain't that the motherfuckin' truth!
WILLIE D: Yeah. And these old fickled minded assed niggas wonder 
Why a ho be with them one day and another goofy motherfucker the 
Next.
DJ READY RED: I think it's time you kicked some more of that shit!
WILLIE D: Yeaaah!

There seems to be a lot of mother fuckers blind to the fact
That a ho is gonna be just that
And this type of ignorance is the very
Reason why so many niggas in the goddamned cemetery
Intelligence is on call
You don't treat a ho like a queen who behaves lika a dog
Are you the type who won't put a ho in front of a trigger
Then you're a ho assed nigga
Goddamned hound
Pound for pound
You knew the ho when she was fucking the whole town
She fucked you and gave your buddies a blow
But your trick ass fell in love with the ho
Tried to change her make her be an angel
You keep putting your damn life in danger
Fronting niggas about that slutty ass trifling crow
You gotta let a ho be a ho

Here's something that I'd like to know (what?)
Why you take that ho, everywhere you go?
You walk around the club wit' the ho in front
Tryin' to keep up with that nasty assed cunt
You say you're captain, but yo' ship she's sinkin'
As soon as you turn your back, the ho is blinkin'
Winkin' her eye at another nigga
But you got her locked down, so you figure
Ho wears your jewelry every goddamned day,
But nigga, you just got the ho on display
Wouldn't let her be herself, cause you's a goddamned wimp
Now you know why hos date pimps
She's a rhinestone freak 5 days a week,
But you get mad when niggas pop on her ass
Goddamned slutty ho, the bars are loaded
Don't try to change her
You let the ho be a ho!

she's a ho, (D how the fuck you know?)
Every time I see the ho she's with a new negro
She's the type of ho that's bound
To wear shorts up her ass when your friends come around
She's the kinda ho that'll make you cry
The kinda ho you have to call before you come by
So why do you wanna kill when she says no more
You ain't the first to be dumped by a goddamned whore
Crazy mother fuckers fighting over hos
Stealing for their asses and jumping out of windows
If a ho wants out I let her sinky ass go
'cause I'ma let a ho be a ho
*Spoken*
WILLIE D: Now do y'all follow me so muthafuckin' far?
GETO BOYS: Yeah!
AKSHEN: Hell yeah. I remember I was with this ho named Kim. 
Let her use my car. Bitch went to go see another nigga. I damn 
Near killed that ho!
WILLIE D: I fucked that ho, man!
AKSHEN: You a mutafuckin' lie!
WILLIE D: I ain't bullshittin'! Didn't I, Bushwick and Red?
DJ READY RED: He went up in that bitch, man!
BUSHWICK BILL: On the for rilla, my nigga.
WILLIE D: Akshen, I'm telling you man...

I fucked that ho before you even knew her
Made her pussy go brrrrr when I stuck my dick to her
I knew she was a ho the first time I met her
So I got another ho and took them to the other level of the game
Got them high as a kite
And fucked both of those hoes that goddamned night
Then I sat back and relaxed
As they 69ed and ate each others cats
I dropped them off at home
God damn look at this shit my wallets gone
The hoes beat me but I left it alone
And used that shit as a stepping stone
I played it off the next time I saw the hoe
I just laughed and fucked her ass some more
She licked my ass and sucked my balls
And if I see her right now I can get some more
You gotta let a ho be a ho
*Spoken*
WILLIE D: Yeah, buddy. Willie D ain't gonna let none of these hos
Get him down. I ain't cryin' or dyin' over none of you hos. I 
Ain't buyin' you no leather. I ain't buyin' you no suede, no 
Jewelery, no contacts, Lee Nails. I ain't buyin' you no hair, no 
Makeup, food, none of that good shit!

The rumors you heard ain't slander
Willie D don't give a fuck about a goddamn by-stander

I'm inclined to physically whip your ass
But if you want to blast

From the hardest to the softest
For me to beat a nigga down is a day at the office
See, my appearance is so damn fly
It makes em say, ""Hm he's a nice guy""

Oh-oh, oh shit, damn, that's a no-no
I get dead on his ass, so when I'm strikin'
He bet no fall, or I'ma make his ass read these Nike's

You read these Nikes, 'cause you're fucked up, punk

So you weak-ass hoes keep dreamin'
Bushwick, can I get a witness?

Yeah, and when I form this gesture
Don't call mama, 'cause the bitch can't help ya
Better yell for a paramedic
Or somethin' that nature, 'cause I'ma try to break ya
Ass into mothafuckin' particles
Let's see if I can get you in a newspaper article
To hell with emotions
I don't stop till I cream a muthafucka like lotion
Remorse what the fuck is that?
I beat your mama ass and go get a six-pack
Gettin' mild, I don't play that shit
Fuck havin' mercy on a goddamn bitch
Nigga get beat, oh mama
But if she fucks with me
Her ass is gonna read these Nike's

Yo D, I saw the way you stomped that muthafucka
And left your trademark upside his head

Yeah man, that was one of my off Nike's
I usually leave the whole mothafuckin'' logo

I don't give a fuck who you hang with, trick
Friends ain't shit when you're gettin' your ass kicked
But if your buddies want to get in my mix
Chop-chop yo, bitch
It ain't nothin' but a mere formality
Every sucker muthafucka' is a casualty
I kick ass, you won't ever diss
Look at the bottom of my goddamn shoe print
From muthafuckas done donated blood to the kid
Now do you want to make a bid?
I didn't think so, 'cause I'd have yo
Ass screamin' just like a damn hoe
When I hit ya in your goddamn mouth
And show you what a real nigga's all about
When I dispose of your ass like waste
And nothin' but my shoe is in your mothafuckin'' face

I'm at the club rappin' to this hella hammer

So I'm rappin' to her, right? To see if she'll fuck
I never asked if she was taken, 'cause honestly
That type of shit don't matter to me
Just when we was leavin' out the goddamn door
Some trick-ass nigga fronted me bout the whore
I let the fool file with a diss or two
But the nigga kept pushin' the goddamn issue
So I pulled out the 9mm
And bust his ass in the head, you could see the 
Blood gushin' out his goddamn skull
He played hisself, now his ass gettin' drugged
I was charged with aggravated assault

I heard a (*shot*) Now what the fuck? Somebody shot at me
I took a look, the girl was cooked, her head exploded
Reached for the Uzi at my foot, and I unloaded
Straight out the window I could hear the soldiers' footsteps
I'm a taker, not a faker, I ain't been took yet
So many hunters, dyin faces to the concrete
Although you try to take me out, you die in one beat
Of the heart, boy, how dare you suck on me?
And I'ma teach you and your boys not to fuck with me
Rolled out the backdoor, lookin' for his bossman
I'll watch him bleedin', pour his blood in a saucepan
He's in his Cadillac, starin' at my front door
I stood behind him, pulled my gun, said, ""What you front for?""
He says, ""I'm sorry, Ak, don't kill me, I was jokin', griff""
That's why your boys are on my balcony and they're frozen stiff
The boy was shocked, then pulled up cops, he looked at me said, ""You're a goner
'Cause you shot and killed the boys who worked my corner""
Pulled back the hammer, put my gun up almost point blank
Shattered his dome, reached in the pocket, took the boy's bank
Got out the Cadillac, the copper, he said, ""Stop it, freeze!""
I aim my pistol for his stomach, instead I pop his knees
Fell to the floor, he looked at me and he said, ""Akshun, please!""
I put my gun between his eyes, said, ""Don't breathe""
He took a breath, and he knew he'd breathe his last breath
That's 20 soldiers and copper, 21 shot to death
I had to leave everything I'd ever worked for 
But best believe, I won't get sentenced for a drug war
But maybe one day in the future I can come back
But until then, I'm goin' home, where I'm from, black

I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'

To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this:

(Bushwick Bill)

Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
Sendin' a nigga to a dentist to get killed
Cause two suckas can't agree on something
A thousand motherfuckers died for nothing
You can't pay me to join an army camp
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
of this United goddman States of this bitch America
Be a soldier, what for?
They puttin' niggas on the front line
But when it comes to gettin' ahead, they put us way behind
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
While Bush old ass on t.v. playin' golf
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
I'ma shoot your funky ass bitch
A nigga'll die for a broil
But I ain't fightin' behind no gaddamn oil
Against motherfuckas I don't know
Yo Bush! I ain't your damn hoe
The enemy is right here g, them foreigners never did shit me
All of those wasted lives
And only one or two get recognized
But what good is a medal when your dead? tell Uncle Sam I said

chorus x2 (Willie D)

I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
   [Fuck fuck fuck a war]

(Bushwick Bill)

In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
P.O.W.'s got hung
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
All I know is the (????) in my 12 gauge
And what if that pin gets stuck?
Several more casualties show up
This shit remind me of a drive-by
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why?
Cause they don't know what they doin'
They see if the coast is clear and they start persuin'
And that's when that booby trap springs, BOOM!
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Tryin' to be a damn hero
They bring your folks that duffle bag
The only shit they want to see is that doggy tag
Hopin' that the worryin' will cease
And your ass will be home in one damn piece
But my mom ain't gotta worry about that there
Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
Man! mother fuck a war!

Chorus x2

Your lucky that I ain't the president
Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over wit
Fuck all that waitin' and procrastinatin'
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
Flyin' back and fourth overseas
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
I'll aim one missile at Iraq
And blow that little piece of shit off the map
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck (????)
Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in hell before I enlist
To eat shit out a can like a worm
And everyday wear the same damn uniform
(????) breakin' on my funky ass feet
Skin crawlin' cause I ain't took baths in weeks
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
And if I do, I'll probably be shell shocked
I couldn't get a job just a free burial
You know how Uncle Sam treat it's veterans
Absolutely no respect
Get a plate in your head, lose a leg, you might get a check

Geto Boys,"Yeah, it's time to do it like a G.O. once again
You know in 1989 we knocked on the door
In 1990 we beat on the door
Now it's 1991 and we fiend to kick this muthafucka in

Lets talk about a scandal
The album Geffen found too hot to handle
Fucked up the minds of you and yours
The last lp from the Geto Boys

Can you believe those hypocrites
Who distribute Guns n Roses but not our shit
And they say we're a racist act

Ain't that the pot calling the kettle black

Man fuck them hoes
We got new partners and got shit done regardless
Cause our fans are everready down to die hard
Around the globe to 5th Ward

I read a news report
Some lawyer in Florida want to take us to court

Somebody tell that country ass hick
To go suck a dead man's dick

You scream obscenity, but it's publicity
You want hoes so don't act like you don't know
Better fuck with somebody else before you get popped
Cause we can't be stopped

Geto Boys   Geto Boys
Geto Boys   geto Boys

People are frightened when they hear the Boys
Cause we ain't just a bunch of noise
None of that me me rappin'
We let your mutherfuckin as know what's happenin

Bitches get raped, niggas get murdered
Adults fuckin kids in numbers unheard of
It's on the news every hour
Why can't I talk about it?

Everybody seem to be after us
Even the manufacturers
Wouldn't press our disc, you know it wasn't fair 
Fuck everybody who work there

And every mutherfuckin reporter
Across every mutherfuckin border

You said the album wasn't coming out fighter
But when it did you couldn't find your typewriter
Keep lettin the government dictate what you hear
Next they'll put stickers on your ears

Even with that move we got 'em in anguish
Cause we'll learn sign language
We can't be stopped 

Geto Boys    Geto Boys

Willie D is the gangsta of love
Some of my friends sell drugs
I sell knowledge that you can't get a hoe
Cause the game is so not toe  

Promoters took away our tour
Negative press made them insecure
And you wonder why you never see a video
Of the boys from the geto

No radio, talkshow, or magazine were we in
And we still in the top 10
You can't beat that with a bat

Huh, hammer can't touch that
We from the muhafuckin south
Now what was that bullshit about?
That we had to be from Cali or New York
Anybody can make it that got heart
Trenchcoats and gangster hats got my back
Any nigga around me got to pack

So come on muthafuckas, come on muthafuckas, FUCK!

That's why I murdered your neices
Wasn't my fault they found they head cut in 88 pieces
Don't let 'em run
Hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm I grab an arm let's pull 'till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked
Means you're better off dead
I wanna see food so I fished in a child's head
Motherfuckers be worried 'cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs
Mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th
The night of the living dead
? ? ? ? ? ? walkin' 'round givin niggas head
If you didn't die, I'd say you got lucky
All bodies found dead
Fuck it, blame it on chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!!!

Verse 2:

Aw fuck, chuck's on a killin' spree!
Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin me!
When I murder, I tried to slack off
Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain!
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back!
A murder contest,
You know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin hungry
I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs!
Bustin' necks with a motherfuckin' brick!
Half my body is chuckie
The other half is bushwick

Haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up
Get up
Sit up
You get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a uzi is my only utensils
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to try to go against chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you
How the fuck you gonna duck?
Yo,
When I'm mad, I'm ready to slay
The graveyards are packed
But it ain't nothin' but child's play

Verse 3:

You'd better murder me
Put me to rest
Cause if you don't I'll come out shootin
With my head in a bird's chest
Pissed off,
The way I'm always soundin'
Killed a punk in '82, and they just now found 'I'm
Some say I'm crazy
Some say I'm on crack
Before I die
Cut off my leg and let me die in iraq
A born loooser
Some say I'm mindless
If I get pissed off
You leave naked and spineless
Worse than charles manson
Never havin' a equal
Went sleepwalkin' last night and killed 300 people
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
When they told me what I did I killed 300 more
Yo
You wanna rumble?
Then go get your war hat
I went to jail for assault with a carjack
I might be small
But my nuts are big
The worst that you could do is let me keep your fuckin kids
Cause I'm a teach 'em how to act
And if they ain't actin' right

Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinkin rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leavin out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I'm cuttin""
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin
She begged me not to kill her, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat, and watched her shake till her eyes closed
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind

Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch

I said, ""Die, muthafuckas!"" as I blasted

The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dyin from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these muthafuckas comin with me""
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember wakin up, in an asylum

Cover your dome or feel the motherfuckin' glock

Biggedy bang biggedy bang hit them motherfuckers dead
I'm down on this track and I'm about to get wreck

Uh coward and that's that

Take a nigga out the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out the nigga

Fazoo his ass and a zigga I'm the founder
Stackin' up bodies like Jeffery Dahlmer

Watch me as I tip toe to a niggas window with my M-6-0
Puttin' motherfuckers out they misery

Geto Boys,"Scarface:

Once upon a time at the Honeycomb hideout
Sugarbear and Mikey sat alone gettin fried out
Lucky walked in with this nigga name Rice Grain
Pulled out a knot and conjured up a dice game
Lucky looked at Mikey and he said with a smile
Where's the silly rabbit I ain't seen him in a while
Mikey turned around and shook his head cause he ain't know
Probably trickin with this bitch from Rocky Road name Cheerio
I'm trippin off this shit cauuse I ain't never seen it right
I'm feelin kind of leary cause I'm higher than a kite
The pipe has really got me on this other level
Its time to mark a murder
My victim's Fruity Pebbles
I'm killin any motherfucker jumpin in my mix
I'm out to get you Pebbles, heard the bitch was turnin tricks
I'm packin up my shit
I'm longin for some???
Up ain't this a bitch Face is on his way to Bedrock
Shortly after gettin their I met up with this crook
Nearly cuttin the bitch in haly like some Shredded Mini Wheats
I'm makin my escape
Sneakin out the back
Fuck I'm being spotted by some fag name Apple Jacks
I put it on his ass so he couldn't come back to key me
Bleedin like a heart, I guess he must have ate his Wheaties
He used to kiss dicks with his partner Special K
I never had respect for homosexuals anyway
I'm on my way to Houston
Played it safe I road the ferry
And ran across this motherfuckin cop name Frank in Berry
He starin at a nigga had the looks as if he know me
He asked about the bear
I said yeah, the bear's my homey
The shit was kind of shady I was nervous from the jump
Arrivin at the docks got the word from Captain Crunch
Arrested for a murder, so now I'm thinkin shit
I didn't know that Captain Crunch was Cookoo for this bitch
My trial came up and now I'm thinkin
The dried up situation needs a little bit of milk
I had a half a gallo and ?? a nigga bought it
Reached and grabbed my spoon and made a motherfuckin run for it
I ate them up and washed them down with Miller

I'm sick of you hoes tryin to run mine 
I'm comin with a good line 
Runnin after one time 
I got a grudge against you blue suits 
Black suits white suits and state troops 
That's the way you made us 
Sent a brother to the penenitentiary is how you play us 
Lock us up for the summer 
Took the brother's name away and passed us as a number 
Just because you legally pack a gack man 
Doesn't necessarily mean you have to point it at the black man 
Especially you black cops 
You let your gacks pop 
Because them honkies got you brainwashed 
Now we come to new dealings 
Fuck all the dumb shit, the line of work is cap peeling 
I'm cuttin shit short 
Ain't no fillin out reports 
Cause you ain't makin it to court 
I'm lettin freedom ring 
From the hole in my glock, for fuckin off Rodney King 
It ain't shit that you can ask us 
And since justice is blind, I'm gone buy the bitch some glasses 
Wake the fuck up chumps 
I'm comin after your ass 
Crooked officer 

[Chorus]
Mr. Officer, crooked officer 
I want to put your ass in a coffin sir 
Cause you done fucked with niggas like myself for too long 
It's time to grab my motherfuckin shit and get it on 

[Bushwick]
Oh Mr. Officer, crooked officer what's happening 
You beat another black man's ass and now you high tapping friend 
Do I have to move to River Oaks 
And bleach my fuckin skin so I can look like these white folks 
Just to get some assistance 
Because the brutality in my neighborhood is gettin persistent 
Cause you want to harass me yeah 
And if I talk back you want to bust my black ass G 
Just like Rodney King 
But if you try that shit with me, its gonna be a different scene 
Try to pull me over on a dark road 
But I'll be damned if I don't grab my nine and unload 
Until every blue shirt turns red 
You heard what I said 
I want all you crooked motherfuckers dead 
So you better start pickin out your coffin sir 
Cause I'm comin after your ass 

[Chorus]

[Big Mike]
Momma called me up the pther day I got a warrant 
Punk ass laws want to know where the gun went 
Say I shot a nigga the other night at a party 
Lying out they ass I was at home drinkin 40s 
Coolin with my niggas playin dominoes in the kitchen 
A big black nigga did the killin and I'm fittin the description 
And you know they think all black niggas look alike 
So now they got the flashlight lookin for Big Mike 
Jackin niggas up tryin to capture me 
Coppers want to gaffle me 
Tryin to put bullets into the back of me 
Time and time again I told them I didn't do it 
And they knew it 
But they still pursued it 
So them motherfuckers blew 
So now I'm about to grab my shit 
And put them son of a bitches six feet under 
Cause I'm sick of runnin from you motherfuckers 
Turnin tables cause I'm able I ain't fallin victim 
Time to play a game, see the police watch me stick them 
Cause I ain't runnin from the p-o-l-I-c-e never 
Motherfuckin t-I-m-e of day

The extra hollow points out the box in the backseat
I can't believe these motherfuckers tried to x me
Once again I'm in the middle of some fuck shit
A busted window and a dead nigga they left me stuck with
I grabbed the cellular phone and called my nigga Face
Had to beep him 911, he wasn't at his place
The phone rang, I picked it up, I heard, What's up, black?
Some ho-ass niggas bust a cap and shot my nigga Mack
They killed my nigga, now I think them hoes are after me
Just dump the body and meet me over at the draft, G
7 o'clock I dumped the body, now I'm changin cars
Get 'em up with Face, now it's time to take them hoes to war

Creeped up slow, dropped the back window
Hehe... now what's up, ho?
Let off a couple of shots but he had posse
The nigga came out the door and like just shot me
It didn't hit me cause I ducked down

the only sign of a murder was the blood on the foresteps
I stopped for a second to wipe it up
and threw the bloody towel in the garbage bag with her guts
pretty as a picture her name was Rosie
had to kill the bitch 'cause she was getting too fuckin nosey
a school hoe she attended you of H
a law student who was looking for a fuckin' case
but she was barking up the wrong tree g
ay yo why in the hell did the bitch want to fuck with me
walking around my crib steady casin'
askin' about the strange smells that were coming from my basement
she asked one too many motherfuckin questions it was time
somebody taught the stupid bitch a good lesson
I snuck in the house by the back door
it was like a scene from psycho
the bitch was in the shower
I rushed her quick so she wouldn't have a chance to holler
and said ""shut the fuck up hoe""
and slammed her motherfucking face against the cold floor
struggling soaking wet
I gagged her mouth with a whole box of kotex
after i fucked her check out what i did
slit her fucking stomach and watched her squeal like a pig
the shit was gruesome g i couldn't call it
i cut off her fingers and flushed them down the fuckin' toilet
and wrote my name on the wall like i usually do

on a platter i watch them sonofabitches scatter
in broad daylight but yo it really didn't matter
i put my gin to their heads and said ""shut up""
the nigga was big i watched this big motherfucker nut up
on the rampage both of 'em got pistol-whipped
the 9 was bloody so i pulled out my pistol grip
the nigga was damn near dead
i grabbed the bitch by her head and told her ""spread your fucking legs""
I placed the barrel of my 9 on her pearl tongue
and stuck a shell inside her pussy and said ""now ain't that fun?""
she started to cry
I saw a tear fall from here eye i said ""bitch you must want to die""
I pulled the trigger of the gun back slowly
and shot up her nigga until he was full of holes g
the bitch was screaming with rage
I stamped on her motherfucking face until it caved in
'cause killing is so damn sweet
I saved the remains and used them later for ground meat
being a lunatic i gotta do the lunatic
gotta do man, yeah living on this avenue

Changing face after motherfuckin face
Watchin niggas catch dope case after dope case
Add it up and you'll find more niggas doing time in the pen
Cause he wouldn't snitch on his fuckin friend

Couldn't come to pay his homey for his bail
But that's the way niggas do you
Caught a case for another nigga and he sware he never knew ya

That your homey runs his own dope house

June, 28 was the date 38
Till the chest plate mommy dear's cryin' at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin' to pay their last respects to the black troop

Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that everyday's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory

Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin'
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin' and drinkin'

Never missin' out on a hood fight
'Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything is changed and people are lookin' lonely
It's gonna be strange spendin' New Year's eve without your homie

But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt, dirt

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin' 'cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin' 'cause they can't accept my homie's death

Another killin' was reported on the evenin' news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin' when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf

But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin', I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
'Cause on the city streets today a brother jus' can't win

When the people you think are your friends
Really ain't your friends, uh and bush wick can't sleep
When everybody aroun' me keeps fallin' six feet deep

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin' next to me has snapped the flip
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it

The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin' all the singing I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left

And then the choir broke into it's final song
Thinkin' to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial sight

The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lower my little partner [Incomprehensible] inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block and that's deep

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music so they had to dance

Couldn't tell 'em nothin' was a player, had ta have it
Got caught up in the game now ma boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in a gang

We used to kick it on the Ave at night
Comin' up tryin' to have the finer things in life
But now my boys gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn't a never fell victim to the clone

So when I drink a brew for you, I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So on remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive real partners come together, and you know that

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

Chorus:  (Spoken)

		You know the streets is all I know
		This is my way of survival
		You know I've been dealt some bad cards
		But I gots to play them
		What else am I to do, look for a job?
		But until them my family will starve and be broke
		So I resort to the streets
		As a source of income
		I'm stuck here

I step out on my own block
And everyone's throwin up the deuce to little J-Rock
And all my little homies that I hang with
Are either jackin, or mixed up with this gang shit
See it through reality
Never leavin the gang cause its the street life mentality
My homies got  a proposition
Pulled the nigga off some change and said he'd help in my position
So now I'm rollin with the OGs
Puttin in work for the jack, for some overseas
And maybe in a year or two
I'll be able to roll in a Benz like the gangsta's do
Makin hoes ride dick
Cause that poor, broke ??? 
Ain't hittin ??? shit
I gotta lock my crew down
And sew this whole motherfucker up like the Jews town
Develop us a strong click
Break my pops off some dope while he rot
Pops would like that shit
Seeing his little nigga on his own two
Doing shit I heard my pops used to do
A real nigga to this crime thang
And had it going on before his time came
I gots to get my shit right
Until my shit gets right
I'm rollin with the street life

Chorus:

		You know what upsets me
		Is when whitey sits back in they lavish homes and BMWs
		And tell me the streets ain't the place to be
		See it from my prospective
		Poverty strickin, livin on welfare 
		And the government cuttin that shorter every week
		I'm shortin on education cause I'm black
		The corner doesn't promise me a good life
		But at least it shows me promise

Finally after shit got right
I'm wanting out of the gang cause I'm searchin for a new life
But I remember what was said
You come in alive the only way you leave out is dead
So I'm kinda fucked on both ends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin frinds
Cause if they were my friends they'd let me break
Outie five thousand fuck this shit, I'm packin my 38
But first I gotta stay down
Until It's time for me to punch it out and just lay it down
And that's a motherfuckin shame
Tonight I gotta spill another ride with my little gang
So slowly I walked up to it
With no hesitation I broke the window and jumped into it
Unhooked his shit and was headed off
I opened up the door that's what set it off
A nigga came out with a glock jack
And put a slug in my motherfuckin back
And my so called friends
Want me out of the gang cause they don't know if I'll walk again
Now tell me what's that deuce life
Fucked up myself for good cause I was wrapped up in the street life",Street Life,1993

This goes out to you H-O-E's
Swangin on the nuts of us motherfuckin G's
You ain't never seen a nigga like me baby
Big Mike aka Big D D
Big dick daddy, droppin you hoes in the sack
Bustin nut after nut on your motherfuckin back
If your nigga wants to make love to you, cool let a nigga know
Cause a nigga like myself just wana fuck you hoe
And if you don't want him to know I won't snitch
You can be his girl but you know you'll always be my bitch
My freak my hoe my tramp my moneymaker
Keep yo bitch right or a nigga like myself will take a smooth
Off the S-L-A-be	
And why you trippin you know your bitch will be rollin with me
So to ladies and everyone throughout your crew
Give a smile in the mean watch out
This dick is for you

[Chorus]
I, bitch I just want to fuck you
Dick, sucked the whole night through
Ass, licked as if I was a star
This dick is for you baby; wherever you are, hey

[Bushwick Bill]
Bitches I scoop them up like jacks
Stack them like racks and send them home with their pussy off tracks
Cause they be figuring me to be a light weight
But if it gets 'em into the bed, then that's OK
Cause when I get them, I'm doin damage to that pussy hole
Not only do I fuck the body, but I fuck the soul
What other nigga do you know that can handle this
Hijack the pussy from the back and dismantle it
It sounds kind of difficult, but it ain't
The only difficulty that occurs is when the pussy's stank
Cause then I'm a have to send you home and throw you in a ditch
Or leave you for the garbage man you unsanitary bitch
So spread your legs wide open boo
And let a nigga like me get down, cause this dick is for you

[Chorus]

[Scarface]
Bitches say I talk bad cause I'm real
And to me expressin myselfis tellin a bitch just how I feel
I had a couple of women in my life but yo
In 1992 I realized that they was hoes
Cause hoes will straight up do hoe shit
Bitches even more shit 
And ladies will give you no shit
So I kicked back and played the hand that I was dealt
Peep game in the mix, and let these hookers play themself
Cause 80 percent of the bitches I meet ain't shit but money bandits
I front like I'm giving up bank
Stick dick in they ass, and leave 'em stranded
But for women, I got a better tactic cause I love them
They come to Mr. Brad cause their mistreated by their husbands
So I hook up shit to make it right
Just call me tonight
And I'll make sure that everything runs tight
Cause if he don't appreciate you boo
The way that I do
You need to let him run back to his crew
Cause he don't understand what you goin through
But regardless to who I screw
This dick is for you

What we see [what we see] everyday [everyday]
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
[What we do] what we do [to get by] to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

(Scarface)
Lets take a journey to the other side
Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane 
When all the money stops

I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ass (????) and pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die 
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto

Chorus (Flaj)
(Bushwick Bill)
Five hundred niggas died in guerilla warfare
In a village in Africa, but didn't nobody care
They just called up the goddamn gravedigga
And said come get these muthafuckin niggas
Just like they do in the 5th Ward
In the South Park and The Bronx and the Watts
You know they got crooked cops
Working for the system
Makin' po muthafuckas out of victims
Don't nobody give a fuck about the po
It's double jeopardy if your black or latino
They got muthafuckin drugs in the slums
Got us killing one another over crumbs
Think I'm lying? Well muthafucka I got proof
Name a section in your city where minorities group
And I'ma show you prostitutes, dope and hard times
And a murder rate that never declines
And little babies sittin on the porch smellin' smelly
Cryin cause they ain't got no food in they bellies
They call my neighbourhood a jungle
And me an animal, like they do the people in Rawanda
Fools fleeing their countries to come here black
But see the same bullshit and head right back
They find out what others already know
The world is a ghetto

(Willie D)
What's up outta towner? Southern nigga downer
I wish you would bring your muthafuckin ass around here
With that hip shit shit from your block 
You fuck around and get shipped back home to ya momma in a pine box
Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward
We got killas and hustlas and playas to so nigga disregard
What your seeing on them western movies
cause yo! I ain't never rode a horse before
Ho, think we slow? Smash the gas
And watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass
Try to load them dice, you'll meet the gravedigga
Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga
See I done seen fools die for less
Than a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set
So get that frown off your face busta

(G.B.)'98
We gonna set this shit straight, belive that
Don't you wish sometimes you can be free
Free from incarceration
Free from paying them bills
Free to come and go when ya feel
Most of all, free from them haters

So many problems that exist in my world today
When I'm deceased, I want my little baby girl to say
That he was real
He loved me with all his heart
He loved mama too
Even though they sometimes fought
A young nigga in the ghetto
With plenty of dreams
Surrounded by the police
And many of fiends
At 13 started mobbin'
14 started robbin'
It's hard to have morals and values
When you're starvin'
Abused, misused, and plus a bad dresser
Nobody ever told me I was special
I put a gang of tears in my mamma's eyes
But she died
Before I got a chance to apologize
It hurts to see my baby sister feeling the pain
It hurts to see my baby brother still in the game
Ain't nothin' change but my finances
I still be stressed
All these motherfucking worries got a nigga depressed
I'm just tired
Every night, I pray to Jesus, rescue me
>From the poverty, hate, racism and diseases
So the lord said
He prepared a place for me
And when he do that
I'ma be free, yeah

I want to be free
No more player hater
I gotta be free

Now as I walk around in my drawers
Outside smoking weed while I scratch my balls
I'm reminsing on my homies who been lock tight
Or got light
Behind trying to feed their family one night
It's not right
Suppose you watch your mamma suffer
Cause ain't another
Her kids trying they off they ass
It's gettin' rougher and tougher
By all means nigga get your cream
Stop storming what they calling this American dream
And why you looking up for a role model
You be your model
Look who we follow
Niggas forgot about the problem
And single parent upbringings
We doing bad on our ass
Nigga fuck singing
How you gonna tell me to keep it positive
And growing up I didn't have a pop to give
So these mother fucking streets is where I gots to live
Fuck what you saying 'bout me
I'm sittin'on a couple G's and smoking weed
I'm free

I want to be free
No more player hater
I gotta be free
I want to be free
Gettin' tired of waitin'
I gotta be free

Nobody understands me but me
It used to bother me at first
But now my conscience is free
I ask the lord to give me strength
And bless the hood
And keep these fake motherfuckers out my life for good
Knock on wood
I'm still here through all these trials and tribulations
Tryin' to make it
Shit, a lot of niggas couldn't take it
My girls hate it
When I go to clubs and stay out late
She think I'm fucking around with hoes
Gimme a break
Get off my case
Can I be committed to you
And ride 'round without feelin' tied down
Damn girl, I catch enough hell on the streets
When I come home
I want some tender lovin' and peace
No one can take your place, you my ace
I dig your jealously boo
But sometimes I need my space
I keep you laced
Like you won the lottery see
But God damn I gotta be free

I want to be free
No more player hater
I gotta be free
I want to be free
Gettin' tired of waitin'
I gotta be free

I want to be free
No more player hater

They Love me

They say now pass the ganga to the left hand side
filppin in the Range Rover blowing past the one times. 
Hit me with the (whoop whoop)
bubble gum flashing in my rear view
spraying freshener trying to steer too
Throwin out my herbs on the passenger side
Got the windows rolled down, airing out the ride
got a loaded 45 inside
that keep for protection when I'm riding by
My Smith and Wesson got a scope too
and I may have caught a body on it
for those who get just know somebody want it
They only ?????
To know that you ain't done shit
but still you got them haters in your business
I'm paraniod she's blowing my high
and she knew that I was buzzin from the red in my eye
Got my license and my papers, Showed me my picture on The Source
Then what the fuck you stopping me for?
and she said

[Chorus]
Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sata put me down
Now, Ow

So I gave her my cellular number and told her call me up
Beating on my dashboard hot than a fuck
Cause I done chunked a half a square thinkin 5-0 jocking trying to jam me up
I continue on my mission to my Grandma''s house
Hollering at my homeboy who just got out
What's up let's roll
Get you some clothes
Take you to the club so you can get with some hoes.
Lets go
Made to the mall hoes thick
Listenting to Pac saying that's the shit. 
Getting geared when this woman appeared up out the blue
Telling me she like what I do
And the hoe was like

in a drop top A-Z-you-are-E
With the knock, knock banging listening
 to a song my nigga Face singing
Eardurms just a ringing, my homey brining
A couple of honies to the hideaway
we gone fuck these hoes and straight ride away
Gotta pack confirmed tickets get some sleep
we rolling to the Baby Johnson fight a 100 niggas deep
ain't bringing sand to beach
I got my eyes on some freak ass broads
and menage-a-trois

and take my dick inside that pussy put it under a spell

Ashes to ashes, in the back is where the pistols pump

Protect my grill, and avoid gettin killed

Baby need a new pair of shoes, and a college fund
My p.o. wanna know how I got a gun
I'm in the presence of my enemies like in the bible
Will I see heaven if I murder these fuckin rivals?

Or speak about it too much, you gon' die by the sword
So think about it, do us an injustice, you know time flies

Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you

In a 7 0 chevy with the drops in slot
Use to pass me pepsi cola while he drunk him a pint
Tippin' to the southside runnin' a light
Use to have me up in 3rd ward checkin' his traps
Collectin' his scratch protection' his snap
Use to always tell a nigga keep your mind on paper
Bitches in your head you keep your eyes on paper
Cause a niggas definition is a killa for scratch
You kill a motherfucker you kill him for that
You got caught up in this shit that means you fucked it up
Old man spittin' game so I sucked it up
Old enough to do my own thang got me again
Flip my second paycheck to cop me a lid
Went and seen my homie short dawg that slided me a track
Went to mase's pawn shop and got me a gat
Didn't know this crack shit I got my uncle to cook
With my eyes on my paper I just fubbled and looked
Impatiently waitin' for the pot to boil
Man I can't wait to see your rock from ?
Put my work upon the table and it's startin' tonight
Time for me to bring brad jordan to life
Sat my ass upon the corner till it started to bounce
Glock scratchin' reach that and started her out
It wasn't long before I was goin' for nine
I'm seventeen around millionaires goin' for mine
And if you got off in my way while I was headed for that
You found your ass misplaces with your head in your lap
And niggas is gettin' shiffer with time

I beat a niggas ass and if I didn't I shot him
Never gave a fuck about his family cryin'
Bottom line, better his than mine
You come around me with that live shit I kill it fast
I throw a search party for your fuckin' stankin' ass nigga

You do your time and you come on back
And if he a homie he really take care of your people while you're gone
And bless you when you come back home

Split the brain get the cain get back to your dirt
And keep the jack you did up under your hat

Niggas was mad, I had my gun
They had they guns too I wasn't snoozin'
Cause I knew that if it came down to it they would use 'em
If it was goin' down right then I didn't give a fuck
We was gonna tear this whole motherfuckin' city up
And nigga that's real comin' from the south
You wack ass rappers watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Preachin' that positive bullshit you can save
Cause your positivity ain't gettin' motherfuckers paid
It's g.b. and willie d reunited
Sendin' niggas back to the studio to get they shit tighter
And niggas thought it wouldn't happen again
But we sat down and settled our differences like men
And put the bullshit behind us
Cause fuckin' off money ain't a plus it's a minus

And while you build your penitentiaries for my children
I plant seeds for my children
So when they cross these roads you'll be prepared
And never show no respect to these hoes that never cared for
Plus they only come around to the black folks
When they run they campaign and they lack votes
Once you vote em in they don't know
Once you vote em in they can't do jack for you
I guess it's true when they tell me you don't fight fair
You turn my ghetto into a seething messy nightmare

(Chorus x 2)

Geto days keep ghetto thoughts relevant
But geto ways make murder imprevalent
You feel me?
I been through many geto episodes all the same
When will niggas learn to use they mind and maintain
See you're always on the defense
Relying on your street sense
I told you once to use them sense to make dollars
Bot to make a mother holler
That hard shit's kind a hard to swallow
Tomorrow there'll be more killings in the hood
From child abuse to drug dealings it ain't good
They want to see us stuck
Shit out of luck
Can't nobody ever say I didn't try to give a fuck
'cause I did and I do
The rest is up to you
No matter what you do to your hood stay true
And you'll make it
Can't nobody take it
Geto fantasies become realities if you don't let em shake it

Oh that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't living right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweating and blood starts coming out my nose
It's somebody watching the Ak'
But I don't know who it is so I'm watching my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say take a chill, B
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm popping in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playing tricks on ya

I make big money
I drive big cars
Everybody know me
It's like I'm a movie star
But late at night something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had caine but it was Gold Medal flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lying
I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's going down let's get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners
My mind is playing tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And trying to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I'd be seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfucking B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete

Verse One: Scarface
June twenty-eight was the date thirty-eight
till the chest plate mommy dear's cryin' at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
goin' to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die
Is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that everyday's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember G
you'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin'
of how we hung in the clubs smokin' and drinkin'
Never missin' out on a hood fight
'cause ever-ee-day back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything is changed and people-are-lookin lonely
it's gonna be strange spendin' New Year's Eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
except pour brew throughout the crew to make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
to see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt

[There's far too many of you dying]
[There's far too many of you dying]

Verse Two: Bushwick Bill
Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
everybody's trippin cause the boy was to young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homeys death
Another killin' was reported on the evenin' news
somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about my self
wonderin' when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
so when I'm rollin' I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
Cause on the city streets today a brother jus' can't win
when the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends Uh
And Bushwick can't sleep
when everybody aroun' me keeps fallin' six feet deep

Verse Three: Scarface
The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
as they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin' nex' to me has snapped the flip
once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defence
the choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin' all the singing I broke down myself
when I looked and seen the family that my partner lef'
And then the choir broke into its final song
thinkin' to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
as we creeped along the gravel on the burial sight
The director said his words and there was not a sound
as they lower my little partner inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
and then they work alone with the concrete block and that's deep

Verse Four: Big Mike
Alotta homies die
Alotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
they chose the music so they had to dance
Couldn't tell 'I'm nothin
was a player, had ta have it
got caught up in the game now ma boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
ashamed to let his mother know that he was in a gang
We used to kick it on the ave at night
comin' up tryin' to have the finer things in life
But now my boys gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn't a never fell victim to the clone
So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block son
you might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So on remember whenever or wherever
dead or alive real partners come together, and you know that

Fuck what video do, but this is all day

The way I see you a bitch and you deserve to be fucked

Aight nigga; stab him in the leg in the chest
in the back and mouth, let 'em haul him off

Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick and {?} James
Ain't no motherfuckin game, we been livin this for real
When the government is workin, real niggaz never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rappin but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggaz they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a rule, 35, he a bought it for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showin up in court, testifyin for the state

[Chorus]

[Scarface]
I'm knowin all the scams, all the tricks to the trade
Know a nigga tryin to get clean, and you get in the way
Know a nigga tryin to get green, and you stick out the bait
Cause a nigga like a dopefiend, can't rehabilitate
Still stickin to the G Code, we playin by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggaz, cause new niggaz is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, stayin down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few
But there's a thousand motherfuckers in the pen bulletproof
So this one here for you, I'm a rep it 'til I die
Fuck a 5-K-1, check his P-S-I
Send his ass to the top if he say he sit at home
He a motherfuckin snitch, snitchin niggaz need this song

She don't want to be with me no mo'
Ain't her fault she just tired of this dumb shit that she don't know
Whether to, throw in the towel or if he gon' grow
And if he do, where is he gon' go?
Got a letter from an old friend, I read it and cried
When he told me that his girl just died
Right out of the blue, breast cancer, wasn't nothin to do
Now I'm sittin here and thinkin of you
Tryin to come to amends, cause really I done wanted you in
You the only one I trust as a friend
I know I'm on my last leg limpin with this bullshit written
But I still gotta bring it to light
Spent half of a lifetime missin cause I would not listen
Confused about my wrong and my rights
They tellin me that time heals wounds though
This wound gon' need some stitches; I got testimony for niggaz
You doin what you do but when the shoe gets flipped
Standin on the other foot got your boots and shit
When you back up and analyze, fix shit and finalize
Before you leave the shit alone just try
Maybe there's somethin you can do to rectify what's did
And plus you gotta think of the kids
That's kinda just the way life is, you either gotta live or you die
At least that I can say that I tried

[Chorus: Scarface]
Cause I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good... enough
Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin by yourself mixed up
But I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good... enough
Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin by yourself mixed up, but I tried

[Willie D]
Faster than a crackhead, can pawn yo' shit
Willie D'll put a foot in you bitch
I sold dope, robbed folks, had to make ends meet
Since 5th grade, I been up in these streets, tryin to get it
Raised by a single mother, two sisters two brothers
I used to think she didn't love us
Cause she beat us so much, plus she came home drunk
But every now and then she'd knock on wood, and say
I tried to do the best that I could - and I believe her
Cause she was treated evil out the box
You can't get what you ain't got
Momma I was young, hittin licks, started helpin you out
'Bout the closest that you came to a man of the house
I was talkin back, walkin through the do' gettin smacked
You used to brag to your friends on how, well I rapped
We never really got along but when you took sick
I was at your side 'til you died
I wasn't the best son but I tried

[Chorus]

[Bushwick Bill]
I've always been crook, never given up
But the past few years has been really rough
Felt like givin up a couple of times
Take a jump or plant a slug deep, up in my mind
Fuck it I'm dyin, done wit strugglin for mine
Sleepin on fans, knowin there ain't no use to me lyin
Change my name for anonymity's sake
But a four feet dwarf that be on television's hard to miss
I get pissed over little shit, little shit drive me crazy
Then I start thinkin 'bout my babies
I cain't go to jail, I cain't die
Who better to teach 'em 'bout this cruel world than I?
Their mommas won't let me see 'em, I still pay my support
Cause once you give life, life is bigger than yours
Maybe I'm not all you expect me to be
But when it's done and said ultimately, daddy tried

Geto Boys,"If, you move, I'll fall
I'm leanin' on you, you baby, you baby
Geto Boys, Willie D

We was livin' on cold facts, cops sat in old 'Llacs
Couldn't get along with T Jones, so he rolled jack
I was on Prozac before I was 12
Spent my senior year in high school, sittin' in jail

To no avail, I was screamin' out and nobody heard me
Messed around and got shot but it didn't deter me
I think I was fourteen, so my boy was one trey
Cut my hair one day, left my crib and got sprayed

And expired right away, nuttin' to say, sad chapter
Around here, either you get killed or you get captured
Sister girl, I ain't know what you was dealin' wit
Pointed the finger at you, now I'm feelin' like an idiot

But I'm wiser now and I seen the world
It's messed up, how they treat us Geto Boys and girls
The doctors tried to resuscitate, it was too late
I got a daughter named Kain and a son named Blank

And they be askin' 'bout you, all the time
I try to be a better man, sometimes I fall behind
So if you feel some extra weight on you, don't be alarmed
Don't move, don't flee, that's me leanin' on you

I'm leanin' on you

Y'all wonder why I act crazy, life don't phase me
For me to still be above ground it's just amazing
Wasn't aware bein' different gave me intangible wealth
That's why I, took a gun and tried to kill myself

My folks got the blame of course, I used to ask
Why did God make my brother so tall and me a dwarf?
This ain't no 'Poor little me song' that's so phony
I got a good life, I'm just sharin' my testimony

But could you imagine bein' me, for one hour, one day
One week, one month, one year? Get out of here
You'd never make it, life's not fair
Everywhere you go, people point, people laugh, people stare

They don't care, so I don't care, most of the day
I feel awkward but I believe I'm goin' to hell if I don't pray
As I laid, on that hospital gurney, fightin' for my life
I felt the demons touch my body then I saw the light

That was you, I know it was you
Cause all the love in the world from my family couldn't pull me through
Lord, when it gets really rough
You're the only one that's strong enough to hold me up
That's why I lean on you

I'm leanin' on you

You're my one and only friend, ever since I was a kid
We've been in and out through thick and thin, tryin' to get a win
Broke as fuck on the corners like a nigga had diplomas
Back in 1985, skippin' class, gettin' high

Fat Turner we were walkin', I remember you was talkin'
'Bout this lick we was supposed to hit and turn us all to bosses
So we took that trip to Austin, and we came back with this package
That would later turn this strongest friendship into us scrappin'

Ain't too sure about what happened, all I'm knowin' is it was money
Had a nigga wagin' war against who I thought was the homey
Shoulda known this shit was evil, by the way it did my peoples
And the whole entire neighborhood fucked up behind this needle

Now we roam in the Regal, windows tinted, dem bangin'
Pistol grip on the frontseat, smokin' and steady drankin'
Drunk and I'm steady thankin' we probably shouldn't left it
Cause every time that a nigga drops a record you arrested

It's depressin' but life and it's lessons'll leave us guessin'
Gettin' out, was a blessin' but lately a nigga stressin'
Which leads me to this question, was money the only reason we feuded
Cause now that we got it, homey let's keep it movin', let's move

I'm leanin' on you

I'm leanin' on you",Leanin' on You,2005

Carefully mappin my escape through plannin
Come in and get it, and leave here with it
Makin fo' sho' that I'll be free when I hit
It's like a dope man's lotto, the dope man follows
The rule here is simple and this is my motto
To get it how you get it homey, Marciealago
Get you a house built {?}
Cause when it's over it's over, no cheese to borrow
You fuck around, get indicted, ain't no tomorrows
My homey locked up, been six years tight
But six years is nothin, cause this kid's life
is off is a cage, for the rest of his days
A price that he paid for the mistake he made
So I'm more focused cause my lifestyle's bogus
I got to get out cause this fast life's over

[Chorus: x2]
You've got seasons to prize, {?} to send
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win

They say the ends, justifies the means
So I guess a drug dealer justifies the fiends
Poverty and unemployment justifies the screams
The reason he stacks his paper just to buy it clean
2006 with shoes the size of me
But in the end he wasn't really what he tried to be
I'd never let no war justify me
I question how hard some of these cats really be
Cause real niggaz don't speak, our actions talk more
Don't make me flip and turn these streets into a chalk war
I do this for all the real niggaz that smoke trees
The hustlers, players, pimps, and O.G.'s
For the up-and-comin cats to the old schoolers
The ones that remember Private Stock and Calvin Coolidge
It's a struggle to make it, keep pushin
See how far you can take it, two eye or one eye navigate it what

[Chorus]

I know this cocksucker pullin me over because of my skin
But the secret is to win, so I hold it in
I'm yessir'n, no sir'n, but when he pull off he diss
A motherfuckin, dick-suckin, redneck son of a bitch
All it takes is one pussy who ain't gettin none
to catch you on a dark street, and put you to sleep
Dude was one deep, at the sto', he said I ain't no ho
Got clapped in the back of his 'fro, woo
It didn't have to go like that, believe me mister
Someday, niggaz gon' respect these pistols
Play the safe, get out the way, when a fool got the ups
Pride'll get a motherfucker shot in the guts
And remember this before you grown, and the day that you gone
Greed it don't last too long
The secret is to {?} up out the game and have money for life
Not to stick around 'til you lose all your shit to the vice

Come on, these years to teach, homey speak to know it
Bodybag what we're talkin' about, you weak, you row
The game is overcrowded so we fight for space
Neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win
Tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay
And double up it, ain't never happened touch it
A lot of niggaz focued on they candy paints
And that was in the grills, steering wheels and grand
But I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to thank

And pray to God that he kept this spot hell me

And if I come to lie for them it's a hard heal to swallow

Havin' visions of cats rollin' in my weight now
It feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down

Geto Boys,"I'ma born killer, you're face to face with scarface
You tried to ice an x, but that's a motherfuckin waste
Your schools fucked up g
And your momma shoulda warned ya about a nigga like me
Cause I don't weep and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucker black, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'mma bring it to your ass g
I'm commin from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't bar none
If you're feelin lucky then go ahead and get cha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit ya ass in the chest with the tech and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, it's a plastic
And hadda bitch out huntin for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killa

(chorus)(2x)
I'ma born killa
Born
Killa
""don't fuck with me""

My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born with out a heart
In other words I'm heartless dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked mannick depressive
I'm takin all types a medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditatin
Yo, the log around my lone is worse
I'm havin thoughts of killin me, but I'm killin you first
Mr. kindness talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit that happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'll let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, it's because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't goin into it
Cause ain't nothin to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the fo place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'mma born killa

(chorus)

Now I'm livin where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make point calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't, I'm starvin duke
I can't go to mommas house cause mommas starvin too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch
I'm gettin paid and you're gettin killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dyin ho and can't nothin save ya
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad
Huh, and you never expected that from brad
But there's a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin out winnin
100,000 in the case now I'm comin out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went ""boom"" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is nigga
I spared a couple a lives, but I'm still a born killa

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see 
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me) 
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free 
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me 
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep 
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed 
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes) 
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line? 
Is it just my test, or is it just my time? 
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did 
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid 
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief 
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me 
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets 
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me 
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say 
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A. 
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese 
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang 
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane 
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes 
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die) 
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie 
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy 
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth 
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you"" 
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets 
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule 
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school 
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me? 

[Chorus] 
Look me in my eyes! 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!) 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee? 

[Scarface] 
Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you 
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you 
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged? 
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain 
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink 
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think 
OK your time is up, now analyze my life 
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes) 
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa 
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over 
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks 
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back 
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked 
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find 
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes 
Looked me in my eyes

Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me

Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me

Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over a foot-large, undercooked, raw, taking a dick
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile

Smile for me, won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile for me

Fuck the world as we elope And witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga

""And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe

They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
