Chuck Jackson,"Any day now I will hear you say ""Goodbye, my love""
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown, oh
Any day now I'll be all alone, whoa

Any day now, when your restless eyes meet someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh
Any day now love will let me down, whoa

Oh my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown, oh
Any day now I'll be all alone

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay-ay
Until you go forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

Any day now when the clock strikes ""Go""
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh
Any day now love will let me down 'cause you won't be around

Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away",Any Day Now,1996
Chuck Jackson,"Go out there, yeah yeah
Said my baby
She won't let me in
Unless I got a fat blunt, yeah yeah
And a bottle of gin
Yeah, all I'm askin', all I need
Is a little of your time
Open up the door baby
I got some real good good this time
Oh, oh, oh

Chuck Jackson,"Sometimes I get a good feeling
I get a feeling that I never, never had before
And I got to tell you right now
I believe, I really do believe that

Something's got a hold on me
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Yeah, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I sure feel strange, but I sure feel good
I said, oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)

Something's got a hold on me
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Yeah, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
I said, oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me
My heart was heavy when in misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

I said oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)
Yeah he walks kike love
(Yeah he walks like love)
And he talks like love

WRITERS BURCH BACHARACH, HGAL DAVID
COPYRIGHT 1966


You should have been there when I was twenty
You never heard such applause
Now I'm twenty-five and hardly anyone knows I'm alive
But there's no use in lookin' back
Because they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
'Cause yesterday's over and I've got to live for today
I'm goin' to a place and nothing can stand in my way
Yesterday is over
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
I know my way now, I'll never look back from this day on
Yesterday is over, can't you see it's over
And I begin livin' today
I mean to borrow one day from tomorrow
And I'm gonna spend it on sunshine and things that I love
I'm gonna reach out and touch every star above
Yesterday is over
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
So wrap up that lovin' cup
I'm a winner from this day on
Yesterday is over, can't you see it's over
And I begin livin' today

Chuck Jackson,"All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking (She don't love him)
Saying that out of my life
Into another's arms you'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me, wake me when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when its over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear
Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when
They say ""She don't love him, she don't love him""
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me
For the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me, wake me somebody when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when its over

Girl you're what my heart desires
My whole world you inspire
I can't bear to be losing you
Cause I've loved you my whole life through

Restlessly I pace the floor
Listening to my neighbor's criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side

As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe I've been replaced
If I've ever ever dreamed before
Somebody tell me I'm dreaming now

I said shake me, wake me somebody when its over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming
And wake me when its over
C'mon wake me, shake me somebody

Baby won't you save me

From this misery


(Chorus ""B"")


Save me, won't you, won't you, save me

Baby won't you save me

From this misery



I wake up crying
After tossing and turning

And yearning the whole night long

Pretty baby since you went away


I haven't spent a happy day


I wake up crying after

Sobbing and sighing and wondering


Just what went wrong

Pretty baby I was good to you

Why you gone and make me blue



I need your love to light up the night

I need your heart to make things right

I'm so unhappy on my own

Don't, don't leave me sad and lonely



(Chorus ""A"" & ""B"")


I wake up crying


After tossing and turning

And yearning the whole night long

I and I heart to make things alright

Don't, don't leave me sad and lonely

Chuck Jackson,"Every day I walk some lonely street
Searchin' 'til you come back to me
People around just stop and stare
As if they know the hurt I bear
And suddenly I realize
I'm cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

'Cause I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And my heart feels much confusion
Since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, since you're not around
I'm helpless

Oh I'm helpless
Since I lost your love
Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
Ever since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world of grieve
I need your words of confidence
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless feel confusion
And your love is your solution

It's my fault
And I won't search for you no longer
As I go home alone
Needing you to stop

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
And my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In a helpless situation
And I need your consolation
And I'm having these strange illusions",Helpless [#],2005

Chuck Leavell,"My telephone rang I was too late
Why did I stop to hesitate
On my way home
Take my hands let me confess
'Bout loving and hating and all of the rest
And ideas I've roamed

Then I saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and
Find I'm blind

My thoughts they make a tender smile
My hands they move and in a while
I've got what I want.
That tenderness that you insist you feel
Ain't worth a damn 'cause it ain't real
Lord it sure does haunt.

Then you saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find you're blind.

See me in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise me or you'll find
That I'm completely blind.

Now I'm so sick of what's being said
My thoughts they burn inside my head
There's not much untouched.
All of my children begin to cry
They clutch at me demanding why
Tell 'em 'bout loving and such.

Then they saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find they're blind.

See them in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise them or you'll find
That they're completely blind
That they're completely blind.",Blind,1973
Chuck Leavell,"Yes I'm Falling
Oh oh falling
Falling in love with you
Was easy as the day
A down man looked up to see
Nice things in his way
Falling in love with you
Was like that first sunrise
Was it in my window
Or was it in your eyes

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time

Falling in love with you
Was learning how to cry
And telling you I'm all alone
Oh please don't pass me by
Falling in love with you
Was learning how to see
That you are you and I am me

You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love 

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me

Chuck Leavell,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Chuck Leavell,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special

Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of

Will you still love me tomorrow

'Bout your plans to make me blue

Not much longer would you be mine, baby

Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

And all your circuits gonna harm
You'll put on that stupid cape and smile
Fly straight into the sun

So spend it while you can
Yeah, you may not believe me
But she used to call me senator

Just like Joan Crawford
She let me know who was the man

Before you catch a cold

Falling and we're rising, lost on the invisible sea
A thousand stolen kisses, a crime without a witness
Throw me overboard captain would you please
I just can't stand myself

I never liked your brother
Couldn't stand that little bugger
I had to see him every day
Your father at the factory, he always had it in for me
Ain't going back there, no how, no way, never again

When she heard her little child scream
She went to the side of her little girl's bed
Oh mama, I've had such a dream

Oh, mama, don't go to the mines today
For dreams have so often come true
Oh, mama, dear mama, please don't go away
For I never could live without you

I dreamed that the mines were all raging with fire
And the miners all fought for their lives
Then the scene changed at the mouth of the mine
It was covered with husbands and wives

Oh, mama, don't go to the mines today
For dreams have so often come true
Oh, mama, dear mama, please don't go away
For I never could live without you

As sure as the bright stars do shine
There's something a-going to happen today
Please mama, don't go to the mines

While lining your pockets as well.

Than to listen to a coward from a tailored world.

Chuck Redd,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2006

Not for a year but ever and a day

Together we're going a long, long way

Chuck Riggs,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,

That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand ;
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand ;
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not ;
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Chuck Thompson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2006
Chuck Thompson,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1992
Chuck Wagon Gang,"Are you looking for someone to be faithful
With your broken heart your shattered dreams
And are you searching for someone who'll be faithful
To you no matter what life brings
Well i know the maker of the storm the sunrise
He is both the lion and the lamb
He is strong enough to shake all earth and heaven
Yet meek enough to take me as I am.

[Chorus]
He says come unto to me 
All who are weary 
And I will give you rest
Bring what hurts 
Bring your scars
Bring the load that you carry
And I will give you rest

Are the clouds above your head oh so heavy
Bursting with showers of despair
And do you struggle under more then you can carry
Has life given more then you can bare
And would you like to trade your failures in for victories
Like piles of ashes in from piles of gold
And can you fall down like a child who is helpless
So he can pick you up and make you whole

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

Chuck Wicks,"I came to see her daddy for sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting in the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf

She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes I'm Prince Charming
But to him I'm just some fella
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

I leaned in towards those pictures to get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say ""Now, ain't she something, son?""
I said ""Yes, she quite a woman""
And he just stared at me
Then I realized that in his eyes she would always be

Playing Cinderella
Riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes I'm Prince Charming
But to him I'm just some fella
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

He slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too

She was playing Cinderella
Riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fella
I'm the one who's stealing Cinderella""",Stealing Cinderella,2007

Oh I'm ready for this ride

Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring

All I ever really wanted was you

If life is what you make it

Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
'Hey Daisy rise and shine'
He pours two bowls of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
The bus is here we love you mom

He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to

And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike just ridin' around

When you're the man of the house

It's late at night and Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
So he runs off, straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down

It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, 'I love you dad'

Wish I could reach through this phone

I'm so proud of you son.'

We were a Friday night
After a football game
We were the coolest car
Moving down the interstate

Oh, I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again

Soaked us, deep in love
We would fall every time
We got back up
So we laid there
And just lose tonight
So baby why don't I

Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive

I can be a little bit stronger

Like take down all the pictures throw out all the letters
Keep myself busy to make me feel better
Go out on the town hang out with my friends
Take my mind to places that it's never been
Where I can find somebody new to take away the pain
'Cause when it comes down to the truth
You're still that empty space I find myself in a place
Where I don't really wanna be
I guess there's no getting over you gettin' over me

I still wake up in the morning
Seeing your face
Sing a little song as if you're walking my way
And think about the first time you said hello
I put roses on the kitchen table
Your favorite time of year was always April
The sun would shine through the bedroom window
And brighten up your day
Oh brighten up your day

Never blipped on your radar screen before
You’re doing what I was doing when I did it a couple magazines ago
That means if you LeBron, I was doing that Kareems ago
Abdul-Jabbar, the coolest are light years ahead and 15 below
How high I am and cold I is is the words that I just spoke, I did
I hope I did, 'cause sometimes I forget how much of a GOAT I is
Not a measuring of how dope I did, not an athlete, but the black sheep
I just rap shit (Sheet), I focus so hard last time I blinked I broke my lids
That was kind of weak (Wake), but what you expect when I get no sleep?
I’m my own worst critic, most times we split it
But we see eye-to-eye on how well we speak
Perfect verses
Better yet, letters get together, graduations and auctions
Bad at lying, but I speak that whale
Also awesome and talkin’ to dolphins

Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
So just find somebody pretty to accept on my behalf
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash

Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash
Why I'm grizzly on my grizzly making all my haters mad


Look, I’m steppin’ out of that all-black whip lookin’ like death and shit
I’ll spring forward, hoes fall back, I’ll turn ‘em down like a pessimist
And I’m at their head like a ball cap, at their neck like a necklace is
So it’s best to quit, ’cause my record spin,
And keep gettin’ replayed like the record skipped
Killin’ game and whores alike, swagged out in my Jordan Flights
Hoes act like I won’t toe-tag ‘em, I’ve got hoes gassed like a motorbike
Snow White, what more to like?
Y’all luck ran out, don’t roll the dice
Snow Tha Product’ll make you aligned
‘Cause you messin’ with me you was born to die
Killin’ game and whores alike, swagged out in my Jordan Flights
Hoes act like I won’t toe-tag ‘em, I’ve got hoes gassed like a motorbike
Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Got hoes gassed like a motorbike

Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
So just find somebody pretty to accept on my behalf
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash

Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash
Why I'm grizzly on my grizzly making all my haters mad

I wanna celebrate this, ’cause some of y'all ain’t gon’ never make it
I appreciate it, thanks but I think she hates it
I don’t wanna hit it, girl, in the hotel room lickin’ pearl
I say “fuck the world,” make me mad, I’ll fuck your girl
No disrespect, you think I just wanna hit that shit?
I’m makin’ history, the truth you can’t take it, bitch
I’m playin’ on the station, like your ass, I’m in rotation
Winnin’, but there’s no sensation, shoot it on her face then
What’d I win, what it do?
I’ll get it later, mail it to me
I’m gettin’ higher, if it’s money, send a wire
I do this daily, she know she gots to pay me
I never lose in the end, don’t give a fuck when I win, bitch!

When there is so much more?
Sometimes the Book of Law
Is only half the story
Means and ends:
Deciding where to draw the line
Loss or work in Sellafield homes
Or the threat of cancers yet to come?
The choice is obvious:
There is no choice
Only the option of looking outside
This narrow definition of ""What you see is all there will ever be""
There comes a time - that time is now -
When every second, every day
When every action, every thought
Will tell the world how you cast your vote

And we say ""Thank you"" when they offer us crutches

Sick of hand-me-downs

All real change
Must come from below
Our bosses must live in fear
Of the factory-floor

And they ask for my support,
I'll give them these words
And a bloody nose:
You don't help your enemy
When you're at war

Tiny sparks still deep inside

When you're watching clouds in a summer sky

I hate being told what to do
I hate you when you don't listen
I hate the way you distort my sexuality with pornography
I hate the pain we inflict on each other
On animals, and on the Earth
And I hate how love songs have become such cliches
through endless, shallow repitition
Each angry word
Every cynical put-down
Every song is carefully born
From a hope of something better to come
All jumbled-up
Love and hate and love
Each prompted by the other:
For the cause of peace we have to go to war
Refusing to sleep
Whilst there's a world to win
Yet happy to dream
Dreams make the plans to change this world
Not just some future heaven

David the world can only take so much 
And with you around, we're in for a really hard time

Where cocaine habits are financed by hunger and disease 
There's only one mountain in the rock and roll business

Who makes the money when the puppets sing 
Ask the corporations where does the money go 
Ask the empty-bellied children what are we singing for 

And Cliff Richard, three, two, one 
The God who remains when the religion's gone 
Cliff, we've got a special surprise for you today 
So come up closer, step this way 
Cliff, you're such an example of moral worth 
Such a purist saint come to bless our earth 
That on behalf of our viewers watching on telly 
And on behalf of the millions with empty bellies 
We're donating something special that we're all going to like 
Cliff Richard, we're going to nail you up to a cross tonight

The third world's got hunger and military control
This unequal balance is a master plan
One gets rich from the other's land

They've got it all worked out - and we give our consent

They've got it all worked out for Central America
They've got it all worked out for Africa
And in our naivety we believe myths and overconsume
And give them our consent
Dying in the shadow of the USA
""Let them eat bullshit, make the land pay""
Make a fast deal with the local elite 
Then substitute cash-crops where once grew wheat
Build a cycle of dependence on a starvation-diet
With food as a weapon, workers stay quiet

And multinational names have blood on their brands
From taking an interest in misused lands
Del Monte, Tate & Lyle, Ralston Purina
Coca-Cola, RTZ, and Unilever
All packaging lifestyles for the glamorous west
Expand the company, exploit the rest

We are not isolated by distance
But by greed and our racist history
Just a wall's width away
Still impossible to see across
This space in front on me

It's we who write this history
We who guard the money-tree
We support the companies
We stole the colonies

And when the system starts to crack
We'll have to ready to give it all back

See the space which lies between the rich and the poor
How the space increases as we keep on taking more
Keeping that space between us all
Is how the west can keep control...
With a mission and a chequebook promising aid
Posing for the camera the United Nations man came
He talked of control and the terrible drought
And the way that the west would bail them out
They he stopped smiling and talked conditions 
Of mutual aid; of American wishes
Sending in aid with sewn-on strings
If they won't buy arms - then it's pulled back in
Feeding the world American style
Col Sanders has an empire behind his smile
Back up the investments with a military regime
Then cleverly say: ""It's to keep the world free!""
But the multinational myths are beginning to fall
The poor don't want aid, they want control
And if we really want to see the Third World eat
We've got to see through the wraping on the high street
Past barriers of culture that dictate our lives
We're busy consuming as the other half dies
And the answer's not a question on charity -
Not whilst profit's still the top priority -
So let the glossy shop-fronts know what to expect
And you Bosses of Companies...
And the cycle of hungry children
Will keep on going round

Whilst Hess remained imprisoned and the fascists they were beat
So the promise of an Aryan world would never materialize
So why did they all come out of the woodwork on the day the Nazi died

The world is riddled with maggots--the maggots are getting fat
They're making a tasty meal of all the bosses and bureaucrats
They're taking over the board rooms and they're fat and full of pride
And they all came out of the woodwork on the day the Nazi died

So if you meet with these historians I'll tell you what to say
Tell them that the Nazis never really went away
They're out there burning houses down and peddling racist lies
And we'll never rest again until every Nazi dies",The Day the Nazi Died,1993

No we never shall go back

With two children to maintain

But our little sister Anne
Why she never checked the man
At the gate, at the gate
Oh you great king in the palace
And you statesman at the top
When you're drinking soda water
Or imbibing ginger pop
Think of some who work at Idris
For very little pay
And who only get nine bob
For a most unpleasant job
Alackaday, alackaday
Now then girls all join the Union

In pickles, jam, or chocolates

'Poverty poverty knock,' my loom is a saying all day
Poverty poverty knock, gaffer's too skinny to pay
Poverty poverty knock, keeping one eye on the clock
I know I can guttle when I hear my shuttle go, 'poverty poverty knock'

Up every morning at five, I wonder that we keep alive
Tired and yawning in the cold morning
It's back to the dreary old drive.

[Chorus]

Oh dear we're going to be late
Gaffer is stood at the gate
We're out of pockets, our wages they'll dock it
We'll have to buy grub on the slate

And when our wages they'll bring, we're often short of a string
While we are fighting with gaffer for snatching (?)
We know to his breast he will cling

Sometimes a shuttle flies out
and gives some poor woman a clout
There she lies bleeding but nobody's heeding

Chumbawamba,"Attend you gallant Irishmen and listen for a while
I'll sing to you the praises of the sons of Erin's Isle
It's of those gallant heroes who voluntarily ran
To release two Irish shamrocks from an English prison van

[Chorus]
My lads for freedom, let's all join heart and hand
May the Lord have mercy on the boys that helped to smash the van

On the eighteenth of September, it was a dreadful year
When sorrow and excitement ran throughout all Lancashire
At a gathering of the Irish boys they volunteered each man
To release those Irish prisoners out of the prison van

[Chorus]

In Manchester one morning those heroes did agree
Their leaders, Kelly and Deasy, should have their liberty
They drank a health to Ireland and soon made up the plan
To meet the prisoners on the road and take and smash the van

[Chorus]

With courage bold those heroes went and soon the van did stop
They cleared the guards from back and front and then smashed in the top
But in blowing open of the lock, they chanced to kill a man
So three men must die on the scaffold high for smashing of the van

[Chorus]

So now kind friends I will conclude, I think it would be right
That all true-hearted Irishmen together should unite
Together should sympathize, my friends, and do the best we can
To keep the memories ever green of the boys that smashed the van

His feats I do little admire
I'll sing the achievements of General Ludd
Now the hero of Nottingham Shire
Those engines of mischief were sentenced to die
By unanimous vote of the trade
And Ludd who cannot a position defy
Was the grand executioner made
Whether guarded by soldiers along the highway
Or closely secured in a room
He shivers them up by night and by day
And nothing can soften their doom
Shall the whole team of humble no longer oppressed
And shall Ludd sheath his conquering sword
Be his grievance instantly met with redress
Than peace shall be quickly restored

Ring up the tills in the High Street

Give it a rest

There's dumb moves behind me and bad debts above
(Buy, buy, buy)
I pawned my affections and still got no love
(Buy, buy, buy)
My heart and my pocket will say it's unfair
(Buy, buy, buy)
I'm unlearning the cost of this Laissez-Faire

Pissing in the wine, pissing in the wine

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

15 people had died
Here, there and everywhere
No reason to kill someone

Church Organ,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1974

(and Short Dawgs in the house bitch). 
With the L.A. Players (soldiers to the game you know?) Yeah. 
(Peep game fool). 
Ant Banks at the crack house 
Ha ha ha better recognize game when it's in your face bitch). 

It's obvious mad cash got me gassed 
Shark tanks and views millionaire cruise buying cars in twos 
""Never lose"" my motto since birth 
Double up knots and crack spots 
Snitches lead out by silence gun shots 
Map the area I wanted to cut the fuckin' cops a deal 
If they don't kneel, They get peeled 
Bitches recognize I never have no drama with death 
Bustas always try I leavin' 'em gagging spittin' up flem 
Take a pen make a mil and if this shit don't sell 
I still got the street powder back to flippin' flower 
South Central nigga what? 
The representer, damn your girl seen me comin' and ran 
Young enough to be my daughter 
My posse use to flip her like a quarter 
To state to my man for man slaughter 
Caught her in the stairway took her out the fairway 
Trunked the punk bitch (That's fair play) 

[Chorus]
You've got the gangstas that I have tangled baby 
Bitch recognize game when it's in your face 
""Well alright y'all"" ""ha ha ha"" 

You think the town rid of Short? 
You must be crazy, that silly shit you talkin' just don't faze me 
I could make a phone call and just like that 
A bunch of niggas from Oakland all on your back 
I've never been a shot caller just a nigga in a crew 
They call me Too Short but I'm still bigger than you bitch 
I been around you can take a turn but don't get burned 
I've seen the tables turn 
Marks turn into killers rich niggas go broke 
Use to be a want to but now I'm old school Short 
In the game never had the stacks since age 14 
I been spittin' these raps soakin' up the game up 
And even when I came up I fucked with same folks 
Still did the same stuff 
Bitch Short Dawgs in the house 
I know you want my dick 'cause it's all in your mouth 

[Chorus]

Picture the game as a quarter toss it up in the air (uh ha) 
Heads or tails win or lose broke niggas are players 
Heads or tails win or lose broke niggas are players
Say what up to the S.P. crooked I.C.E. 
Ra rolling with the strap on the side of me 
Partna' don't get it twisted up I got hollow tips extended clips 
Major chips lookin' at Eclipse jacuzzi dips 
Niggas step back I don't know you 
Don't get to close to me 
Some niggas ain't really the motherfucker they suppose to be 
Cloud killers don't aim until you shoot in the air 
Better put it down and brake some hoes off like a true player 
Phoney as three dollar bills niggas ain't recognizin' 
Fell in the relapse besides I'm a trauma a nigga 
Look in the eyes and when you see me I be hardcore 
What the fuck a real nigga gotta lie to kick it for? 
I'm tired of these bubblegum ass niggas 
Throwin' monkey wrenches into the game 
And all the players and pimps feel my pain 
Hustlers maintainin' riches and keepin' presidentials 
Not artificial with fishin' niggas know I'm packin' missles 
Get me two Bentleys some houses Johnson jet skis 
Ballin' till I die nigga don't fuck with S.P.I.

What you know about that No-Doz and coffee
No sleep, I'm lookin' 40
With three bricks in a 740
Bitch I ain't got time to party
I'm breakin' bread with Dominican niggaz
Over a hot Bennigan's dinner
Thinkin' how I'ma cop the 6 at the beginnin' of winter
Chrome it out and then fit it with timber, that's wood grain
What you ain't know, this a hood thang
All my thugs let ya wood swang
Bitches make ya ass clap
I'm takin' all y'all ASCAP and BMI
Catch me drivin' DUI

The block is sold, ""CLEAR!"" then I shocked the globe
I clock the hoes, lock do's and drop the 'bows
I rock the shows; pop lock and knock yo nose
You Bia' Bia', I grab my .44 and mop the flo'
I 'Mop & Glo'; the Feds tryin to stop my dough
They claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow
I bring the pain, cock back and swing the thang
Yo' girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her, I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaaassspy
'Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes was dazed
I was in the zone, coulda thrown up them tre's
And if you lost, Lil' Jon's got some Eastside ways
So stop actin' like a Bia if yo ass ain't blaze

Bitch niggaz in the house tell me what's up
A nigga slapped you in the mouth and told you shut up
Somebody holler get 'em and now you just a victim
Shorty tried to stick 'em, told the pit bull to sick 'em
I know he wanna run but he can't he assed out
Punched him in his chin and then he passed out
Woke up with his pockets turned inside-out
Always hit them weak motherfuckaz right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
'Cause niggaz will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude
Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler
But since you can't run, you might as well fight
Quit actin' like a bitch and live a real life

Niggas livin lawless, niggas labeled hardest
Gonna see who's life is shortest
Regaurdless this whole world to me is garbage
Tryin' to reap my harvest
I'm starvin' livin a life of ballin'
I'm still tryin' to find my callin'
And make a change, look into my eyes all you see is pain
Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow
Maintain my burrow
I represent the slums, ate the crumbs
Now I'm reachin' for a new height
Nothin' but love and we glued tight
Played and renew sight
Hustlin' for food type

And I ain't thinkin' bout nothing but
You and me blowing hash in the midnight hour
I know you thugging in the streets bout your money

But best respect this pussy got the power
You can't deny the way I twurk this here
I'm talkin' freaky on this here come one and work this here
And bust it open like I'm bout to get burnt in here

I do my dirt in here, you know what I'm workin with
These titties perky, I ain't a virgin you ain't gotta worry bout a thing
Just lay back cause I'm on a mission to please
And I got plenty doe whodie so I ain't lookin for cheese

Not tonight I got a quarter pound of that weed
And we can go to the verge, come one put it all in me
I like it real deep, wit no rubber so that you can feel me, you feel me?
I got your bitch wantin to kill me behind the snapper

'Cause I fucks like a master, and suck like I'm dracula
And I ain't caught up in the rapture

[Chorus: x 2]

[Rap]
(Shawty!)My baby momma sleeping (yea)so tonight I'm creeping (uh huh)
20 west, to where you rest, your heads the best (that's rite)
I bust on your chin (skeet skeet motherfucker) you rub it in (hah)
You make a preacher man sin

Now we butt naked fucking all on the floor (uh huh)
I got you screaming louder than a 2 doller hoe (uh huh)
I'm beating that pussy up like a heavy weight fight (uh huh)
Ya came 3 times, how that dick girl (oobie whispers: TITE)

[Rap]
Girl I hit the door with nothing in my mind
So when you feeling freaky baby call me anytime
You say tonight, no small talk or foreplay
On that purple 'dro, allassy, and hennessy
All the freaky things you do got me going crazy
Got me thinking to myself can you be my lady
But hell naw, cause I can't fall in love wit the cut
Just stop by to hit it quick and get enough, a-get enough

[Chorus: Oobie 2x]
Tonite I'll sleep with nothing on
So make sure that you hurry home
Cause I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you, waiting for you
With nothing on

[(Oobie sings) 2x]
Tonite I'll sleep with no clothes on
So make sure you hurry home
I'm waiting aa-all alone
Don't make me, wait too long

[Rap by Bo Hagon]
I'll beat the pussy up and leave you in bed legs shaken
Wake up alone by 2 in the morn' like damn, Hagon
Careful what you ask for cause you just might get it
And once I came would you swallow or spit it

I know you freaky you don't have to admit it
I take 'em petite , or thick in the thighs
I like to fuck 'em while I look in they eyes
So go on, cut up , girl toot your butt up and do your thang
Sad but I knew your pussy before I knew your name

Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow

Hold up
Self-employed so I'm paying me
Stayin' true 'cause it stay to be
Won't loud part candy captain then get a ticket then pay the V
Rap 84 of the 83, ain't rhyme them and they end with me, 
How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face
All the sinners star calling God, 
All the rappers start calling Mace, 
Drop sounding like an earthquake, 
Trunk bound to make an earth shake
Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day
Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they've been calling me, 
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Soon they see roll up, uh, roll up, 
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

[Chorus]

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

Chyna Whyte,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast

And the friends that pretend to be your folks

I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor

They ain't gonna be well after this one right here

Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'

Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?

I always remember...

Please remember me
I feel I'm fading in your heart
And it's alright that we're apart
Just remember me
New love has embraced us both
I know that you're under oath
Please, remember me...
Remember... remember...
Remember me
Because this highway is long
And who knows what will come in years
Remember me
Because you can't forget your past

Chynna Phillips,"Time wasn't on our side
Our lives pull us away
And I face the lonely night
Love put us to the test
We were touching less and less
In a world of emptiness
Oh is the answer here
Right here in your arms
Baby, hold me near and
Keep our love from harm
[Chorus]
This close
We've never been this close before
We almost walked away
This close
We've never been this close
I pray that every step I take
Gets closer to you
That's when there's time and distance
Something gets through
Till we're this close
We've never been this close
I waited by the phone
The candles burned for you
But you never did come home
The night ain't your closest friend
In a cold and empty bed
With the words we left unsaid
Oh I know the answer's here
Right here in my arms
Baby, never fear
My love will keep you warm
[Chorus]
I held my breath for you
Nevertheless I knew inside
I'd be with you
Maybe it was pride
I've heard in time love grows
But I never dreamed we'd be
This close
[Chorus]
I've never been
This close to you",This Close,1995
Chynna Phillips,"A couple of weeks out of my life
That was all we were
(All we were)
You fell right into passion's web
Haven't you ever learned
(You never learn)
I never gave you my heart?
We were always one step apart
[Chorus]
Did you think that we were somethin'?
Do you miss the world we shared?
Did you think we'd just go on and on, and on, and on?
I'm afraid you were mistaken
I need more than just one man
I was never one to see love through till the end
They say time can heal all wounds
So don't you worry
(Don't you worry)
Throw that smile back on your face
In a hurry
(In a hurry)
Don't come crashing through my door
Love don't live here no more
[Chorus]
Boy, you were really somethin'
Diamonds in your eyes
It wasn't all for nothin'
You had me hypnotized
Kept me mesmerized
You know you did
You know you did
Don't come crashin' through my door
Love don't live here no more
[Chorus x 2]
Just go on and on, and on, and on
See love through till the end",Till the End,1995
Chynna Phillips,"I was reaching for a higher star
Every time I did, there you were
I was looking for a dream come true
I looked up, it's still you

I wish we could begin once more
I wish I never closed that door
I'm wishing that we can be
Back where we used to be

[Chorus]
I'll never walk away this time
I want you back in my life
I'll show you what love can do
Turn around, turn around
There's nothing that I can say
I'm hoping we can find a way
Oh, all you gotta do is
Turn around, turn around

I had let you slip away too fast
If I could, I would relive the past
I would never make the same mistake
I want you back again

I'm hoping these words reach you
I'll always be needing you
I'm hoping that you're still free to
Open your heart to me

Let's face it, some people just aren't cut out for this
I've never felt a love deeper
But this mountain just it gets steeper
You know what I can't give, but I can commit to this

[Chorus]
When 2000 comes, I'll be ready then for you
I'll be ready for the sweet love you had in mind
When 2000 comes, I'll be waiting here for you
I'll be waiting with a sky full of space and time for you
I'm an ordinary girl with a screwed up mind
(You know the kind)
Condescending words aren't my way
I'm just trying to find an answer for you
You see, somebody else is going to love you
You see that I only need you
There's somethin' twisted here that's stranger than fate
They say the world will get better
Without you, hey, what would it matter?
I don't need to hear no new age crap about love
[Chorus]
Before I walk away, can you really say you're gonna miss me?
I'm gonna miss you
It's time to face the fact that we're better off for now
Just let go

You see, somebody else is going to love you
You see that I only need you
There's somethin' twisted here that's stranger than fate

Will you come back to me?
I've thought about it many times
Follow your destiny
I understand if you have to leave
Tell me my love
Why have we separated again?
Was it my love?
Have I controlled the fate of us again?
I tried to rationalize it, but I was scared
That you would never be there for me
And you tried to sympathize
You said, ""Oh, baby, when will you believe in me?""
[Chorus]
Just another day
I'm searchin' for inspiration today
Am I too late? 
Has heaven already closed the gate?
'Cause I'd walk a million miles to be with you

Are you lost inside your mind?
Has confusion taken all of your reality?

Chynna Phillips,"When I’m with you, I feel naked and sacred
And this world can be so cold
I wanna hold you naked and sacred
Till I grow old

What does love mean? Can love last?
I ask myself these questions, haunted by the past
I’ve walked these city streets, I’ve known victories and defeats
Searchin’, hopin’, just barely copin’

Baby, I want to be good for you
I want to be true
Don’t know how I’d live with myself
If I ever hurt you

When I’m with you, I feel naked and sacred
And this world can be so cold
I wanna hold you naked and sacred
Till I grow old

Since I met you, my life’s changed
I feel like a bird that’s been let out of its cage

Baby, I want to be good for you
I want to be true
Don’t know how I’d live with myself
If I ever hurt you

When I’m with you, I feel naked and sacred
And this world can be so cold
I wanna hold you naked and sacred
Till I grow old

Your hand’s healing me, your love’s filling me
When you go away, your heart's still in me

When I’m with you, I feel naked and sacred
And this world can be so cold
I wanna hold you naked and sacred
Till I grow old

When I’m with you, I feel naked and sacred
And this world can be so cold
I wanna hold you naked and sacred
Till I grow old

Chyno Nyno,"Si eva no se hubiera comido la manzana 
La vida fuera sin malicia y mucho mas sana 
Pero como esa cabrona se comio la fruta 
Por eso es que hoy en dia hay mujeres tan putas

Se visten enseñando los muslos y las tetas 
Se tiran de espalda y se les ven las nalgas 
Entonces dicen que uno es un bellaco y no respeta (seguro) 
Puñeta, pues a la calle asi no salgas (puta!) 

El hombre llega hasta donde la mujer lo deje 
Pero algunas se guillan cuando visten como fleje 
Y si tu les pitas o les piropeas 
Se encojonan pero como quiera coquetean (arroz!) 

Yo no sabia el talento que tenia 
Ella el microfono agarro 
Improvisao cantó flauta soplo 
Y hasta la melodia se trago

Quien lo dira que asi seria
Tan santita que se veia 
Ella el microfono agarro 
Improvisao cantó flota soplo 
Y hasta la melodia se trago

Hey! pana mia usted si que sabe 
Y yo pa esa cerradura aqui tengo la llave 
Yo te lo entro como juan por su casa 
Y tu le das la bienvenida, eso duda no cabe 

Toda la noche tu lo sabe 
Sin perder el ritmo, sin perder la clave 
Te dejo loopiao el beat en repeat 
Y antes que el sol se asome 
Convertir en un exito mi nuevo hit! 

Vamo a bacilar dale mami no te enzorres 
Bellaquear contigo por las venas me corre 
No te quite dale dale fuego pa rompelo 
Dejame meterlo despues de conocernos 

Buscate a tu prima a tu amiga a tu hermana 
Que yo ando con el combo de torresabana 
Segueta quiero darte por detra y por delante 
Subirte a la cima y las nalgas guallarte

Por encima, partiendo la tarima 
Partiendo a las gatas que se suben arriba 
Dentro e' la cabina ñengo los domina 
Agarrate los tobillos que te voy a inyectar morfina 

Secret weapon shh shh callaito que es secreto 
Apaga la luz que lo voy a meter completo 
Me dejas contento vuelvo y te lo meto 
Si tu me dejaras yo te lo dejara adentro 

Va a pasar el macho que yo rapido me empacho 
Y tu que que tienes cara que me vas a pegar los cachos 
Que me vas a dejar quidandote a los muchachos 
Despues le doy un jamakeon y me vas a llamar los guachos 

No quiero que cocines quiero bacalao gaspacho 
Vuelvo y me escracho, hize mal la tacho 
Si hay miedo me embacho nah de novio chacho 
Yo no te llamo nah por que estoy bien borracho

Lui g hablando claro dile que estoy loco 
Por comerle el aro dale tabla por ahy pa' bajo 
Ella lo sabe que se le maca el gajo 
Mi hermano, antiel la vi janguiando en sabana bajo 

Yo se que tu quiere senda clava 
Yo se porque tu anda con la chocha apreta 
Yo la miraba y ella mas lucia, se ponia 
Quiere bellaqueo, ella quiere figa 

No te guilles fina rompe la rutina 
Y deja que el dembow explote las bocinas 
Eso eh esto es pa pasar el rato 
Dale mueve ese culo pa meterte el aparato 

Yo no sabia el talento que tenia

Tengo una chica que le gusta beber cañita 
Se ve bonita cuando encima se vomita 
Loca loca loquita los pantys se los quita 
Que fresca me enseña todos los pelos de la crica

No me oyes es licenciada 
Quiero hacer chaca chaca todo el dia en la playa 
Ultra siete cuando la ultra
Chinito te la deo en la bañera y te clava en la sala

A tu hermana que se una que no sea charra 
Que el guau guau no muerde, solo te escupe en la cara 
Las viejitas que se quite la enagua 
Esto es al garete a lo juque en gladia marra

Que hay mi pana 
Dile a eva que no hay palo pero el saco de manzana 
Y que si quiere saranana aqui hay lana 
Y no va a faltar la marihuana 
Tambien le traje rola por si traen a la hermana 

Y se ve beautiful tiene un traje transaparente blanco 
Y un g string azul 
Loca por montarse al audi hasta en el baul 
Me vio flaco y dijo que hasta le paresco cool 

Y yo como le tengo envuelta la mente 
Se las mange toitas por mi pana el caminante 
A ella le gusta el sushi pero de carne caliente 
Y lo siente esta bien bellaca la demente

Chyrik Show,"(I just wanna tell you that I love you)
(And I appreciate everything you've done for me thus far)

[Chorus]
When they ask we don't play around
Load up, roll up, and then we lay 'em down
Niggas hustle on the block with them thangs round
Keep the fast cake, keep a choppa' just to lay em down
If he try, give that lame a lullaby
Make him touch the sky, and  if he gotta we lay em down
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate for one second, to lay 'em down

Another man down let me see you try to live through 'em
I had the whole town talking 'bout what you did to 'em
Funny how quickly they forget what I give to 'em
Life or dead situations I had us live through 'em
Still let the ? off
Couple more to pick off
When the drama is lit you can't cut the wick off
Streets taught him well, learnt it until it cost him
Reciprocated the hate and turned it into a fortune
Never woulda tried his hand, but they forced him
So right after they fried his man, then they off'ed him
Yeah you know the trees, the mink stop right below the knees
Four door shit from overseas
Underboss from the other side,
Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side
Never the money, always for the love of it
After you put 'em to bed, I sing 'em a lullaby
Mwah

[Chorus]

Give that lame a lullaby, bed time story
You wouldn't die to do fed time for me
You gon' fuck around and make the headline story
Bitch in the whip, lettin' it redline for me 
Fuck ? get somethin' on the freeway, sucka free
Five less than twenty for the bird, nigga fuck wit me
Three less than six for the P, get it on the arm
Organic dope, cuz you can get it on the farm
I'm a Godfather, I'm a Don
My ? is my word, word is my ?
Can't be stopped in the first, or the fourth quarter
Work coming in on the dock, now that's a boss order
Big diamonds, clear like VOS water
Payin' money to the judge fuck a court order
Do it big like Frank White
And the K 'll put your brains on the floor, like it ain't right

[Chorus]",Lay Em Down,2012

With what I'm bout to say boy
Here we are once again
And I'm having second thoughts boy
I'm not messing with you head
But I changed my mind boy
I don't know why I'm here
At the same time I want you near
If you want me to leave
I will understand
See I would just have to respect
Your wishes boy
Cause if I stay ain't no telling
What may happen boy
Although you look so good to me
It's best that I leave

[Chorus]
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
Boy your turning me on right now
Can't get down like that right now
Don't want to disturb the flow
But this is not my M.O.
Hold up wait a minute movin' too fast
I want somethin' like this here to last

Don't say no baby
Not right now baby
I want to be your lady
You got me going crazy
Well I guess I'll stay for a minute
Then I have to go boy
This moment is so temptin'
Right now it's not what I want boy
Maybe if we just embrace
With a simple kiss boy
But that'll only make things worse
Hope I'm not getting on your nerves boy
I just want it to be right for both of us
When you don't have to say a thing to make me comfortable
Boy you make me so weak when you look at me
But right now I'm a little confused I think it's best that I refuse

[Chorus]

Supposed to be playing cards
Or watching a movie
But we keep locking eyes boy
Now why you trying ta tease me
This room is getting heated
Would you open a window
I think I should go now
Cause I can't take this no more

He can get whatever
He ask me for what I'm talking about'
Something I cant do without
I can't find the strength to leave
Cause it feel good to me,
And I don't want him to leave

Ooh 

[Chorus]

Its crazy 
Tell me how come
Something I really want
Is something I love so
Is bad for me
I can't explain it, yeah 
Its just like a bad habit
I can't shake it
So crazy crazy crazy (yeah)
I can't believe it
How I need him
He makes a difference
Y'all I'm trippin'
Its crazy
I don't know which way to go
Can't let him go
Even though
I know
He ain't the one for me


Tonight if this ain't smart
Cause he'll probably break my heart
But he's the best thing in a while that's ever happen to me
I don't care what all the other people say
Don't want him to go away
I'm hoping that he stays right here with me
Its so crazy
Woo oh 

[Chorus]

Its crazy 
Tell me how come (how come)
Something I really want (I really want)
Is something I love so

Claimin' you pimpin' but ain't got one bitch
The only hoes is the one you water ya lawn wit

They say
He do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble (and I heard)
He ain't nothin' but a pimp
He's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club (and they say)
He think he slick
He's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs (and I heard)
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nothin' but a thug
So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?

And they say
I'm a slut, I'm a hoe, I'm a freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
You're too smart, you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm this
They say that I'm that
But all of it's fiction
None of i'ts fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your love
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
It be fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be like her
Misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes
They're nothin' but liars hatin'
I bet they wouldn't mind tradin' places
With you by my side in my Mercedes

Mo' money mo' problems
Life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin'
So what, that's your cousin?
That don't mean nothin'
Her like missin' is a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies are just obvious as cries for attention
Yield to the blindness to apply your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous
Drama from your mother, mean mug from your brother
I'm that author of the book they can judge from the cover
(Yes) I been to jail, and
(Yes) I'm grindin' for real, and
I'm a positive they talkin' negative pimp
They hate to see you doin' better than them

Therefore he lifts me up

Suppose I was a toad 
And no I ain't gonna rest

Ciara,"Can you feel me?
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it

Let's play a game, let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, trying to see into your mind

See into your soul, no limits to the levels me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you that makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing and the way you play the game

I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going, got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it, going in and outta them lanes

I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up looking like there's something you wanna

Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you that really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited, yeah

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited

Your dreams fulfilled, you're rocking with the best
Unforgivable I?ma put your limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, you're trying to catch your breath

(Don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the force in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approached you, look how I expose you
Look how I done studied every move, now I know you

I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me

(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see, the passion's inside me
It's yours, now come try me, c'mon

Tell me
What you thinking about when your hands is all on me
?Cause I've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
?Cause you swept me off my feet, ooh

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited, yeah

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
?Cause baby you're invited

I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe
I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe

Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
