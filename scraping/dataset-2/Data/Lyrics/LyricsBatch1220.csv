Townes Van Zandt,"Eight years old with a floursack cape
Tied all around his neck
He climbed up on the garage
Figurin' what the heck
He screwed his courage up so tight
The whole thing came unwound
He got a runnin' start and bless his heart
He headed for the ground

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape

All grown up with a floursack cape
Tied around his dreams
He was full of spit and vinegar 
He was bustin' at the seams
He licked his finger and he checked the wind
It was gonna be do or die 
He wasn't scared of nothin' boys
And he was pretty sure he could fly

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape

Old and grey with a floursack cape
Tied all around his head
He's still jumpin' off the garage
Will be till he's dead
All these years the people said
He's actin' like a kid
He did not know he could not fly
So he did

He's one of those who knows that life
Is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
Always trust your cape",The Cape,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"I wish I was in Austin 
In a chilly parlor bar 
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas 
And not carin' where you are 
But here I sit in Dublin 
Just rollin' cigarettes 
Holdin' back and chokin' back 
The shakes with every breath 

Forgive me all my anger 
Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the git go 
I'll love you till I die 
I loved you on the Spanish steps 
The day you said goodbye 

I am just a poor boy 
Work's my middle name 
If money was a reason 
I would not be the same 

I'll stand up and be counted 
I'll face up to the truth 
I'll walk away from trouble 
But I can't walk away from you 

Forgive me all my anger 
Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the git go 
I'll love you till I die 
I loved you on the Spanish steps 
The day you said goodbye

I have been to Fort Worth 
I have been to Spain 
I have been to proud 
To come in out of the rain 

I have seen the David 
I've seen the Mona Lisa too 
I have heard Doc Watson 
Play Columbus Stockade Blues 

Forgive me all my anger 
Forgive me all my faults 
There's no need to forgive me 
For thinkin' what I thought 
I loved you from the git go 
I'll love you till I die 
I loved you on the Spanish steps 
The day you said goodbye

I wish I was in Austin 
In a chilly parlour bar 
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas 
And not carin' where you are",Dublin Blues,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"I was born by the railroad tracks 
Well the train whistle wailed and I wailed right back 
Well papa left mama when I was quite young 
He said now ""One of these days you're gonna follow me son"" 
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I ain't ever satisfied 
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I ain't ever satisfied 
Now I had me a woman she was my world 
But I ran off with my back street girl 
Now my back street woman could not be true 
She left me standin' on the boulevard thinkin' bout you 
I got an empty feeling deep inside 
I'm going over to the other side 
Last night I dreamed I made it to the promise land 
I was standin' at the gate and I had the key in my hand 
Saint Peter said ""Come on in boy, you're finally home"" 
I said ""No thanks Pete, I'll just be moving along""",I Ain't Ever Satisfied,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"Oh Ellis Island was swarming 
Like a scene from a costume hall 
Decked out in the colors in Europe 
And on fire with the hope of it all 

There stood my father's own father stood huddled 
With the tired and hungry and scared 
Turn of the century pilgrims 
Bound by the dream that they shared 

They were standing in lines just like cattle 
Poked and prodded and shoved 
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom 
Some were were torn from someone they love 

Through this sprawling tower of babel 
Came a young man confused and alone 
Determined and bound for America 
And carryin' everything that he owned 

[Chorus] 
Sometimes when I look in my grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings inside 
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life 
So don't take it for granted say grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 

Now he rocks and stares out the window 
But his eyes are still just as clear 
As the day he sailed through the harbor 
And come ashore on the island of tears 

My grandfather's days are numbered 
But I won' t let his memory die 
'Cause he gave me the gift of this country 
And the look in his Immigrant Eyes",Immigrant Eyes,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"There is no deeper blue
In the ocean that lies
As deep as the blue
Of your laughing eyes
No sweeter sound
Than your gentle sigh
No heart was ever so pure

Dream pretty dreams
Touch beautiful things
Let all the skies surround you
Swim with the swans
And believe that upon
Some glorious dawn
Love will find you

Come some day
I'm bound away
Wind and wings on the water
Whatever may
You must stay
And remain my beautiful daughter

There is no deeper blue
In the ocean that lies
As deep as the blue
Of your laughing eyes
No sweeter sound
Than your gentle sigh
No heart was ever so pure

Good night Katie Belle, good night",Katie Belle,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"Me and Bill there we both come from Georgia 
Met Hank out in New Mexico 
We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa 
We hear that he's payin' in gold 

I guess a man's got to do what he's best at 
Ain't found nothin' better so far 
Been called mercenaries and men with no country 
Just soldiers in search of a war 

[Chorus:] 
And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

When this war is over might go back to Georgia 
And settle down quiet some where 
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile 
Heard tell there's some trouble down there

[Chorus]",Mercenary Song,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"Just when every ray of hope was gone 
I should have known that you would come along 
I can't believe I ever doubted you 
My old friend the blues 
Another lonely night, a nameless town 
If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around 
I know I can always count on you 
My old friend the blues 

Lovers leave and friends will let you down 
But you're the only sure thing that I've found 
No matter what I do I'll never lose 
My old friend the blues 

Lovers leave and friends will let you down 
But you're the only sure thing that I've found 
No matter what I do I'll never lose 
My old friend the blues 

Just let me hide my weary heart in you 
My old friend the blues",My Old Friend the Blues,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured `em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the lawbooks not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",Randall Knife,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"Everyone in Nacadoches knew Tom Ame's would come to some bad end 
Well the sheriff had caught him stealin' chickens and such 
By the time that he was ten 

And one day his daddy took a ten dollar bill 
And he tucked it in his hand 
He said I can tell you're headed for trouble son 
And your momma wouldn't understand 

So he took that money and his brothers old bay 
And he left without a word of thanks 
Fell in with a crowd in some border town 
And took to robbing banks 

Well outside the law your luck will run out fast 
And a few years came and went 
'Till he's trapped in an alley in Abilene 
With all but four shells spent 

And he realized praying was the only thing 
That he hadn't ever tried 
Well he wasn't sure he knew quite how 
But he looked up to the sky 

Said you don't owe me nothing and as far as I know 
Lord don't owe nothing to you 
And I ain't asking for a miracle Lord 
Just a little bit of luck will do 

And you know I ain't never prayed before 
But it always seemed to me 
If praying is the same as begging Lord 
I don't take no charity 

Yeah but right now Lord with my back to the wall 
Can't help but recall 
How they nearly hung me for stealing a horse 
In Fort Smith Arkansas 

Judge Parker said guilty and the gavel came down 
Just like a cannon shot 
And I went away quietly 
And I began to file and plot 

Well they sent the preacher down to my cell 
He said the Lord is your only hope 
He's the only friend that you gonna have 
When you hit the end of Parker's rope 

Well I guess he could of kept on preaching till Christmas 
But he turned his back on me 
I put a home made blade to that golden throat 
And asked the deputy for the key 

Well it ain't the first close call I ever had 
As I'm sure you already know 
I had some help from you Lord and the devil himself 
It's been strictly touch and go 
Yeah but who in the hell am I talking to 
There ain't no one here but me 
And then he cocked both his pistols and he spit in the dirt 
And he walked out in the street",Tom Ames' Prayer,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"I come to you with empty hands 
I guess I just forgot again 
I only got my love to send 
On Valentine's Day 

I ain't got a card to sign 
Roses have been hard to find 
I only hope that you'll be mine 
On Valentine's Day 
I know that I swore that I wouldn't forget 
I wrote it all down, I lost it I guess 
There's so much I want to say 
But all the words just slip away 

The way you love me every day 
Is Valentine's Day 

If I could I would deliver to you 
Diamonds and gold; it's the least I can do 
So if you'll take my IOU 
I could make it up to you 
Until then I hope my heart will do 
For Valentine's Day",Valentine's Day,2001
Townes Van Zandt,"Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep on gamblin', lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

One time, friends, I had a ma, I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, she headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

I came of age and found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
Seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

A friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother, did we fly
The posse caught up with me, drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years, just a-waitin' 'round to die

Now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't steal or cheat or drink or lie
His name's codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Together we're gonna wait around and die",Waiting Round to Die,2002

Townes Van Zandt,"I got a black widow spider for mama, Lord
Got a diamond-backed rattler for pa
Well, I got me a woman down in New Orleans
Got a friend in Arkansas

Got a morning full of make believe
Got an evening full of time

I've got the hands, pretty lady
Gonna make you grieve
Lovin' gonna make you mine

Ain't never seen your town before
And I won't be back again
I need me a place to hide my face
From the howlin' of the wind

I got the blues sewn into my jacket sleeve
Got a goatskin full of wine

I got the hands, pretty lady
Gonna make you grieve
And the lovin' gonna make you mine

So light the lantern above your door
And hold your curtains wide
Take the ribbon from your hair
And lay it by your side

And I ain't looking for a lie to believe
My own'll do me fine

I got the hands, pretty lady
Gonna make you grieve
And the lovin' gonna make you mine

I got the hands, pretty lady
Gonna make you grieve
The lovin' gonna make you mine

Townes Van Zandt,"Well, some have called me hunger's child
Some have turned away
Well, some said wild and a few said free
Some have refused to say

Ah, do you think that you know my name?

Well, the songbird somehow sweetly sings
The sun somehow she shines
And the fireflies cut the cold black wind
Paint their strange designs

And the wind she sings my name

Take your armies, take them from my door
Your battle's built on doom
All your standards all lie shattered now
'Neath the portals of my room

And the walls they sing my name

Well, some have called me hunger's child
Some have turned away
Well, some said wild and a few said free
Some have refused to say

Do you think that you know my name?
Do you think that you know my name?
Do you think that you know my name?

",Hunger Child Blues,2003
Townes Van Zandt,"Well, she stands all alone with her sorrow
Like a bird that's afraid to sing
She lives for the pain tomorrow will bring

Will she call if she starts to fall or will she silent go?

Well, her scarlet jasmine is tucked away
'Neath her vest of purest gold
And her eyes can't hardly help but say I'm cold

Will she call if she starts to fall or will she silent go?

Well, the winds that howl behind her face
Through the falsehoods in her mind
Ain't strong enough to leave her lace behind

Well, her shelter starts to tremble
As it holds her mind away
From the golden flashin' cymbals that say

Will she call if she starts to fall or will she silent go?

When a virgin mistress again she comes
Now no longer is she free
To play upon her gypsy drums for me

Will she call if she starts to fall or will she silent go?
Will she call when she starts to fall or will she silent go?

Townes Van Zandt,"At my window
watching the sun go
hoping the stars know
it's time to shine
daydreams
aloft on dark wings
soft as the sun streams
at days decline
Living is laughing
dying says nothing at all
baby and I are laying here
watching the evening fall
Time flows
through brave beginnings
and she leaves her endings
beneath our feet
walk lightly
upon their faces
leave gentle traces
upon their sleep
Living is dancing
dying does nothing at all
baby and I are laying here
wathing the evening fall
Three dimes
hard luck and good times
fast lines and low rhymes
ain't much to say
Feel fine
feel low and lazy
feel grey and hazy
feel far away
Living is sighing
dying ain't flying so high
baby and I are lying here
watching the day go by

Well, my delta boy I'm afraid you're up too tight
But you take it slow and somehow you come meandering out my way
And I'll take you in my arms and make it right

Well, come away with me, my little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for a while
If you stay you'll see I can bring you lots of joy
I can turn those little teardrops to a smile

Townes Van Zandt," stood in line and left my name
took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
now I can't stay there no more


Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
to move some old cars around
maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
and the junkyard's a pretty good ways
that job's about a half week old besides
it'd be gone now anyway


Unemployment said I got no more checks
and they showed me to the hall
my brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
a little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
we're headed down into fall


I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose


The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south
but Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart I know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me


Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry


Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
so's to meet me by and by


Marie will know I'm headed south
so to meet me by and by

Townes Van Zandt,"I played the Red River Valley 
He'd sit in the kitchen and cry 
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin' 
And wonder, ""Lord, why has every well I've drilled gone dry?"" 

We were friends, me and this old man 
We's like desperados waitin' for a train 
Desperados waitin' for a train 

He's a drifter, a driller of oil wells 
He's an old school man of the world 
He taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to 
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls 
And our lives was like, some old Western movie 
Like desperados waitin' for a train 
Like desperados waitin' for a train 

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him 
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe 
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes 
Lying 'bout their lives while they played 
I was just a kid, they all called me ""Sidekick"" 
Just like desperados waitin' for a train 
Like desperados waitin' for a train 

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty 
He's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin 
Well to me he was a hero of this country 
So why's he all dressed up like them old men 
Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two 
Jus' like desperados waitin' for a train 
Like a desperado waitin' for a train 

The day 'fore he died I went to see him 
I was grown and he was almost gone. 
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen 
And sang one more verse to that old song

Townes Van Zandt,"Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon & lettuce & homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin' out in the garden

Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one
Plant 'em in the spring eat 'em in the summer
All winter with out 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'
Everytime I go out & pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things that money can't buy
That's true love & homegrown tomatoes

You can go out to eat & that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with egss, eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the site put 'em in the middle
Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life I lead
I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better

Townes Van Zandt,"He's a wino, tried and true. 
Done about everything there is to do. 
He worked on freighters, he worked in bars. 
He worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars. 

It was white port, that put that look in his eye 
That grown men get when they need to cry 
And he sat down on the curb to rest 
And his head just fell down on his chest 

He said ""Every single day it gets 
A little bit harder to handle and yet"" 
And he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered 
And the words just rolled off down in the gutter 

Well he was elevator man in a cheap hotel 
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell 
He's old in years beyond his time 
Thanks to the world, and the white Port wine 

So he says ""Son,"" he always called me son 
He said, ""Life for you has just begun"" 
And he told me a story that I heard before 
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore 

Well he could cut through the years to the very night 
When it ended, in a whore house fight 
And she turned his last proposal down 
In favor of being a girl about town 

Now it's been seventeen years right in line 
And he ain't been straight none of the time 
Too many days of fightin' the weather 
And too many nights of not being together 

So he died

Well when they went through his personal affects 
In among the stubs from the welfare checks 
Was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door 
An address in Dallas, and nothin' more

A couple from the mission down the street 
Sang Amazing Grace, and no one cried 
'Cept some woman in black, way off to the side

And 'ol One-Eyed John said her name was Alice 
And she used to be a whore in Dallas

Townes Van Zandt,"Now bein' six years old, I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for

Bigger than anything they is, at least that's the way she feels 

Trains are big and black and smokin', louder'n July four, 
But everybody's actin' like this might be somethin' more...

Than just pickin' up the mail, or the soldiers from the war
This is somethin' that even old man Wileman never seen before

And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Somethin' strange is goin' on, and we's all in the way

Well there's fifty or sixty people they're just sittin' on their cars
And the old men left their dominos and they come down from the bars

Everybody's checkin', old Jack Kittrel check his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop 

So we already knowed it, when they finally said 'train time' 
You'd a-thought that Jesus Christ his-self was rollin' down the line

'Cause things got real quiet, momma jerked me back
But not before I'd got the chance to lay a nickel on the track

Look out here she comes, she's comin' 
Look out there she goes, she's gone,

She's a fast-rollin' streamline 
Come to show the folks

Will sit and watch you do it
And when it's time they'll do the same

It's the evil that's inside you
You know the winner of the game

Oh no, can't you feel the pain?
Can you feel the misery?

Well, time goes on
And you feel your body slipping
There's no control, you're a slave

You breathe in deep
And be sure your hearts still pumping
You ain't ready for the grave

One more time
And you promise the you will quit
But today's just not the day

Everyday you give that
Same old sermon
Still you crack your life away

Today they found you
In your room, your eyes were empty
A stem of a glass clutched in your hand

Your heart had stopped
And your life had left you

To our prayers
The endless road ahead
Is from our errors
Overbearing powers strengthening
Atomic fear of what tomorrow brings

Meltdown of the soul
Threat of termination
Social Overload

Hopes and questions
Running through our mind
But it's a case
Of blind leading blind
Money rules the hearts
Of men we fear
But still the people do not hear

This was the house where we all stayed
There was a tree we used to hang out under
This was the place where I played
But now that's gone so I have to wonder
Is it worth the price we pay?
A long range test has put us under
And made us go away, go away...

This was the town where all my friends and I had grown up
The only place I've ever known
A long gray street with some houses built on it
Less than perfect but it was home
Now it's gone and I curse it in my darkness
This is the cross I have to bear
We pay the price of our own injustice
We made us go nowhere
Go nowhere, nowhere


This was our earth our garden of Eden
Took what we could and left her there bleeding
And what became of the hopes and the dreams
Did they die with us 'cause that's how it seems
Here comes the rain can't you taste the acid?
Or has it left you numb?

Can you hear me son...
Or have you gone away

Programmed by money, sex and darker fears
Forty thousand killings seen
By the time that I'm eighteen
A product of the world
That we're living in

They make you think this
Their thoughts are the thoughts of the thoughts that you think
That's why you think this

To this mass of confusion
Pre-decided path you take
Is just an illusion
Starting out at day one
Now the training has begun
This is how they reach
Into your mind

See it! You eat it! Consume it!

And be amazed

And there's third world news everyday
A hunger for freedom that's needed today

The soul that's within you

After all I've seen so many die - die!

Praying to the dollar sign

We could turn black and white to gray
But the bigotry and ignorance just won't go away
Save the children on a distant shore
When they're starving and homeless dying at our door

But the world was sleeping, any dream will do

I wore my coat, with golden lining
Bright colours shinning, wonderful & new
And in the East, the dawn was breaking
The world was waking, any dream will do

A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew outta sight
The colours faded into darkness, I was left alone

May I return, to the beginning
The light is dimming, and the dream is too
The world & I, we are still waiting
Still hhhhesitating, any dream will do

A crash...The world & I...",Any Dream Will Do,1998

Toy Light,"Dark comedy cold as the ocean
Ad a l0l cause nobody seems to know when I'm joking
For those who haven't heard of me
I'm bad at sarcasm so I work in absurdity
On that laugh to keep from crying tip
Rap like Wyatt vs Chet in Weird Science
Cause my genre's all hack
Actions cliche, melodrama falls flat
And everybody's getting fired
I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired
Rap songs like Patch Adams
Shadyac thought of it as art 'til they laughed at it
Rap songs like Steven Wright
Monotone drone, people wonder if he breathing right

We got that dark dark comedy
That dark d-dark dark dark d-dark comedy

Cause rappers ruin the punchline
Like stand up club hecklers doing the punchline
Cause I'll tweet on Sunday morning like a preacher at a church
Because my true religion is the thirst
It's like Burn After Reading
The dark ugly truth that addicts learn at the meetings
Sean already wrote about the modern man
The only other option is the plight of the hologram
It's dark comedy, I would've called it black
If another dude calls me a racist, I'mma snap
Cause Google knows what's in my cabinet
And Facebook logs all of my favorite sandwiches
And what they need the damn data for
To analyze the shit they'd need a whole 'nother labor force
Cause I'm addicted to my celly
And I gotta have some coffee in my belly, ya smell me

There's mad shootings on the news
Unless it's in the Chi, cause blacks and mexicans can die
I swear we live in John Lennon songs
Matching track suit like dude in Royal Tenenbaums
It's like the In Living Color cast
We'd laughing trying not to wish death on the upper class
I'd like to run up on the Koch Brothers
And beat 'em with a garden hose made of old rubber
Give 'em rock bottoms and a cold stone stunner
Drop some cold butter on 'em from the skyscraper
Pistol whip 'em with the handle of a lightsaber
Cut 'em with rice paper, chuckle like a wiseacre
Instead think of something sarcastic, black

My man Busdriver knows what I'm laughing at
My man Milo knows what I'm laughing at",Dark Comedy Morning Show,
Toy Matinee,"Jenny was raised in a house of cards 
A face that could hijack your breath 
The legs of a thoroughbred 
That's what they said of Jenny Ledge 

Into the fray with a Royal Flush 
Determined to bring home the gold 
And drink from the fountainhead 
That's what they said, my Jenny Ledge 

How I wished I could answer her prayer 
To be held by an honest man 
How I wished I could always be there 
But my love was not in her plans 

Chorus 

Tempted by half-Elvis, half man-about-town 
And a life of ease 
She runs off with the Vegas King 
And I'm nowhere to stand, I can't understand 
Why Jenny won't wait for me 
 
Later I held her and asked her why 
""This is my house and this is my car 
and this is my bed"" 
That's what she said, my Jenny Ledge 
 
Just a slave to security 
She has forgotten the urge to win 
All she has is a king and a pair 
And a tear for what might have been 
 
Chorus 
 
So this is the ballad of Jenny Ledge 
My anger unspoken 
My eyes are learning to cry instead 
Love is dead for Jenny Ledge 

Once she stood with the world at her feet 
And the love of an honest man 
Now she sleeps while the world marches by 
In the care of an also-ran

How we wish you were here 
The weather's getting warmer 
Now that the trees are all cleared

And we recognize no crime

And a few who still believed 
Yes I think there were five good men here yesterday 
But they were asked to leave 
So we've kept the good old vices 
And labored to invent a few 
With cake in vulgar surplus 
We can have it and eat it, too

Men of reason, hide your face 
Walking backwards, plays his ace

An idea you cannot hum 
There may not be an empty seat 
When all is said and done 
I'm not the guy who sings the hymns 
No bleeding heart to mend 
But I like the part where Icarus 
Hijacks the little red hen 

Someone said the Big Man 
May be joining us soon 
But I never was the type to hang 
With the harbingers of doom 
And this party is addictive 
Self-destructive, no doubt 
So I hope that someone saves a seat for me 
On the last plane out

The landmarks of the age 
I find... a coat that's poorly lined 
Handed down from time to time 
Waiting for the sun to shine 

Standing here amidst this crowd 
And wondering aloud 
I find... a joke that's poorly timed 
Thinking back to simpler days 
Of waiting for a light to change 

[Chorus] 
No one can take this away from me 
The martyrs and madmen I learned of in school 
Will remember my name 
Some things are never the way they seem 
Bury our centuries' wasted regrets 
And remember this reign 

Walking from the weary gloom 
The din of empty rooms 
I find... a poem that's poorly rhymed 
And waiting for the walls to fall 
I'm stunned by the failure of it all 

[Chorus]

It's only water falling down 
It's only water in my tears 
It's only water drowning me 
It's only water for all these years

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
When I first started back in 1989
I was trying to claim games, I was barely writing rhymes
I was 7 to 8, a little nigga with his head straight
Never got to school early, always went to bed late
Grew up with the older dudes, do what your brother do
It's just so he happen to rap, ""Man you think you cool?""
Ali was my motivator, rapper slash educator
Kept these boys dedicated mama like we better had made it
'cause my first name's paid, my last name bills
Even though I got a record deal I paid bills still
And erreybody changed to sell us
I wish the fans would understand to except us and just us (?)
I know we blush, on a well-equipped bus
And money we got enough, at least enough to not fuss
We still got stress like you
So in other words little dirty we just like you
ya know!

[Chorus: Toya]
They thought he changed up since he came up
But he's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his game up 'cause the fame stuck
But it's the same ol' Murphy
Might have switched his friends up since he done been up
'cause it's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his rims up on his benz
But he's the same ol'.. Murphy

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
I know you ain't acting front-why (?)
My fans are like the police they be asking for me
Ask them do they know me they probably say who cares
Tell 'em I'm with Nelly they getta coming in pairs
The fame thing is the same thing as the devil
People who see you never put on you on a hell of a level
I once wore scuffed up Air Force 2's
And this girl said, ""That ain't Murphy Lee look at his shoes!""
See these kids are so smart recognize you from head start
They be like ""I know that ain't you up in Wal-Mart""
Can't a brother buy his own draws I'm not a star
I'm a grown ass boy I'm not staying the in car
But people gonna recognize, they know who you are
Well if they see me today, they gon' be cool tomorrow
'cause I'm a be at Circuit City buying DVD's
And hungry eating fries at your local Mickey D's

[Chorus: Toya]
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, I'm still the same dirty, dirty I still make mistakes
I know my birthday was the only day a dirty saw a cake
I'm humble like an African King I appreciate things
Let me refer you on what's happening then
In 93, had an idea we really believed in
94, 95 we began critiquing
In 96, I think we signed some bullshit
97, yo we had the number one hit
98, had to vacate to get our shit straight
Signed with Cool-to-love to get rid of one of the headaches
In 9-9, it's when them boys got signed
and if Nelly don't sell a record then it all goes down
0-0 through 0-1 we weren't below no one
and no one could ever take from or want more done
0-2, Lunatics sold damn near 2
So in 0-3, we gon see what Murphy Lee gon do

Toya,"(feat. Toya)
[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
When I first started back in 1989
I was trying to claim games, I was barely writing rhymes
I was 7 to 8, a little nigga with his head straight
Never got to school early, always went to bed late
Grew up with the older dudes, do what your brother do
It's just so he happen to rap, ""Man you think you cool?""
Ali was my motivator, rapper slash educator
Kept these boys dedicated mama like we better had made it
'cause my first name's paid, my last name bills
Even though I got a record deal I paid bills still
And erreybody changed to sell us
I wish the fans would understand to except us and just us (?)
I know we blush, on a well-equipped bus
And money we got enough, at least enough to not fuss
We still got stress like you
So in other words little dirty we just like you
ya know!

[Chorus: Toya]
They thought he changed up since he came up
But he's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his game up 'cause the fame stuck
But it's the same ol' Murphy
Might have switched his friends up since he done been up
'cause it's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his rims up on his benz
But he's the same ol'.. Murphy

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
I know you ain't acting front-why (?)
My fans are like the police they be asking for me
Ask them do they know me they probably say who cares
Tell 'em I'm with Nelly they getta coming in pairs
The fame thing is the same thing as the devil
People who see you never put on you on a hell of a level
I once wore scuffed up Air Force 2's
And this girl said, ""That ain't Murphy Lee look at his shoes!""
See these kids are so smart recognize you from head start
They be like ""I know that ain't you up in Wal-Mart""
Can't a brother buy his own draws I'm not a star
I'm a grown ass boy I'm not staying the in car
But people gonna recognize, they know who you are
Well if they see me today, they gon' be cool tomorrow
'cause I'm a be at Circuit City buying DVD's
And hungry eating fries at your local Mickey D's

[Chorus: Toya]
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, I'm still the same dirty, dirty I still make mistakes
I know my birthday was the only day a dirty saw a cake
I'm humble like an African King I appreciate things
Let me refer you on what's happening then
In 93, had an idea we really believed in
94, 95 we began critiquing
In 96, I think we signed some bullshit
97, yo we had the number one hit
98, had to vacate to get our shit straight
Signed with Cool-to-love to get rid of one of the headaches
In 9-9, it's when them boys got signed
and if Nelly don't sell a record then it all goes down
0-0 through 0-1 we weren't below no one
and no one could ever take from or want more done
0-2, Lunatics sold damn near 2
So in 0-3, we gon see what Murphy Lee gon do

Toya,"I was in love wit him since I was 12
By age 14 I was just catching hell
He was the star of the football team
Other girls wanted to fulfill his dreams
I was too young too scared too insecure
All of the love in my heart was so pure
This was until I had just turned 16
That was the night he tried to get in my jeans

What should I say
When I didn't want to push him away
But I was scared to give up my thing
When all along I knew he had waited for so long to see
If I was gonna give him all of me
But that's where I wanted to be
But then again 
I remember the talk I had with my friends

[Chorus]
Oh no if you swing an episode
I just hope it ain't a fiasco
Sometimes boys can treat you so ghetto
And I don't want to say I told you so
Oh on
If you swing an episode
I just hope it ain't a fiasco
Sometimes boys can treat you so ghetto
And I don't want to say i told you so

After that first situation had past
It was this guy I had sat by in class
He was the type that made you wonder about
How he got down cause he did talk a lot
So we hooked after school one day
Went on some dates and we spent spring break
Together and then one night at his spot
While watching T.V. things got real hot
What should I do cause I had already took off my shoes
And I didn't want to seem to loose
Though deep inside I was contemplating giving him a try
Cause he seemed absolutely perfect for me
But after wards what would he think
Here we go again
I remember the talk i had with me friends

[Chorus: x2]",Fiasco,2001
Toya,"Without you there's no change 
My nights and days are grey 
If I reached out and touched the rain 
It just wouldn't feel the same 

Without you I'd be lost 
I'd slip down from the top 
I'd slide down so low 
Girl you'd never never know

Without you without you 
A sailor lost at sea 
Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small 
Let me be me all along 
You let the fires rage inside 
Knowing someday I'd grow strong 

Without you without you 
A sailor lost at sea 
Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain 
But I could never climb alone 
I could start another day 
But how many, just don't know 
You're the reason the sun shines down 
And the nights, they don't grow cold 
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young 
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you","I Do, Pt. 2",2001

He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love 
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear 
He made my heart stop pulputatin every time he came near 
He had a spankin new Range for that tight wardrobe 
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his head was cornrowed 
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bow 
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I shook my hips, took a dip, roll my tongue 'cross my lips 
And when he took his place to dance wit me I felt fingertips 
On the small of my back, so I had to react 
Like I was playin hard to get and told that boy to step back

Not seeing your face
I just began to stop setting your place
And I stop longing for your warm embrace
And it was God that made me able
To finally sleep at night
Though you're not by my side
Finally I don't hardly cry
See right when I start letting go
Somebody wants to let me know
Can they take your place
No they can't fill your space
No

I tried to move on but you're not gone
'Cause in my heart you still live on
See now I know why
I'll never love another for the rest of my life
And why
Now that you're gone I'm holdin' on
And deep in my heart
I wanna move on
And now I know why
I'll never love another for the rest of my life

I finally put your cloths away
You know the ones you wore the day
That you were taken away from me
I just began to stop wearing my ring
And I finally stop playin' our song
When I realizied I was dancin' alone and
Finally God gave me strength
To go on and breath again

'Cause you had me under your spell
I knew that you was frontin', when I asked you
You just wouldn't tell
Whenever the phone would ring
You always gotta leave the room
You said it was your momma
But why she callin' the cell
At 2'oclock in the morning

Is it somebody else you giving your love to
Somebody else that think they can trust you
Somebody else you always run to
Somebody else I'm a let have you
Somebody else that you want to creep with
Somebody else that you want to be with
Somebody else that you better leave with
You better beat it cause I don't really need it

What else can I do
But let you go
It's time to tell you
That it's over
I tried to please you
But what you don't know
Is that I can't play these games no more

You know I spend my time
To keep you by my side
But all you do is lie
And all I ever do is cry
It's just a waste of time
That I can not deny
It's time to set you free
Cause somebody else is waiting for me

What else can I do

Toya,"He was a 6 foot stallion say his story of a thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a fat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop bobblatatin everytime he came near
He has a spankin new Range for that tight wardrobe
His pants were saggin, he was padded, and his hair was cornrowed
He has his wrists bling blining and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

It's time to activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips took a dip roll my tongue cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me i felt fingertips
On the small of my back so i had to react
Like i was playin hard to get and told that boy to step back

Hey mister,
Stick out ya wrist, how many in this?
Stick out ya chest, are those baguettes?
I need to see how deep them pockets get.
Let me see if all that shit you talkin' really legit.

Fifteen miles an hour, maybe mo'.
You can make it straight from your seat to your front door.
You can get a glimpse of the one that they call Mo.
Mr. Low-pro, fans peepin' like there he go.
Two lane now, put yo' bite on me.
Y'all done waited too long, I got a tax ID.
Right ID, proper registration never thought I'd see.
Full coverage on my feet.
Hold up, slow it down and let me think about it.
Froze up, everything that you can see around me,
My neck, wrist, arm, the whole nine.
I done took you best shot, now, dirty, you hold mine.
Got cats goin' to jail tryin' to do what I do.
I got cats goin' through hell when the thing come through.
2-0-2, light gray blue.
Stitched in the carpet, you know who-ooh.

Who the boss?  Flossin' is applesauce.
Dirty third grade.  Bought milk on Thursday.
Now I buy Escalades on birthdays.
Lex and Mercedes on these.
E's off these n-u-t's.
I cough and sneeze for frost bit sleeves.
It's not just me, but really my family.
You want the run down?  Keep it poppin' to sun down.
 
Dirty, come now, I'm a show you who run the town.
Your baby daddy is most hated, can't listen to my song
When he at home, irrated when the video on.
I'm makin' ones with them niggas, see my ass in the club.
Puffin' the bud, and spendin' a hundred for every dub.
What he got in his hand?  I'm at it again,
But I really can't stand a lunatic plan.  Work it.

Before you run up, make sure your funds up. (Why?)
I'm gonna buy some shit out of her you ain't never seen,
But probably wrist bands, mo' denim starched jeans.
Diablo boots with the posher string.
I'll take a cream-a-team shirt with the Bentley sleeves.

Drop-top jumpan suit, by Mike E.
Got to like my player,  I'm in it for the dough.
I'm in it for show, matter fact I'm in it to blow.

Looked and said that's nothing but game Cam

That's right I had to call up L

Toya,"(feat. Toya)
[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
When I first started back in 1989
I was trying to claim games, I was barely writing rhymes
I was 7 to 8, a little nigga with his head straight
Never got to school early, always went to bed late
Grew up with the older dudes, do what your brother do
It's just so he happen to rap, ""Man you think you cool?""
Ali was my motivator, rapper slash educator
Kept these boys dedicated mama like we better had made it
'cause my first name's paid, my last name bills
Even though I got a record deal I paid bills still
And erreybody changed to sell us
I wish the fans would understand to except us and just us (?)
I know we blush, on a well-equipped bus
And money we got enough, at least enough to not fuss
We still got stress like you
So in other words little dirty we just like you
ya know!

[Chorus: Toya]
They thought he changed up since he came up
But he's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his game up 'cause the fame stuck
But it's the same ol' Murphy
Might have switched his friends up since he done been up
'cause it's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his rims up on his benz
But he's the same ol'.. Murphy

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
I know you ain't acting front-why (?)
My fans are like the police they be asking for me
Ask them do they know me they probably say who cares
Tell 'em I'm with Nelly they getta coming in pairs
The fame thing is the same thing as the devil
People who see you never put on you on a hell of a level
I once wore scuffed up Air Force 2's
And this girl said, ""That ain't Murphy Lee look at his shoes!""
See these kids are so smart recognize you from head start
They be like ""I know that ain't you up in Wal-Mart""
Can't a brother buy his own draws I'm not a star
I'm a grown ass boy I'm not staying the in car
But people gonna recognize, they know who you are
Well if they see me today, they gon' be cool tomorrow
'cause I'm a be at Circuit City buying DVD's
And hungry eating fries at your local Mickey D's

[Chorus: Toya]
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, I'm still the same dirty, dirty I still make mistakes
I know my birthday was the only day a dirty saw a cake
I'm humble like an African King I appreciate things
Let me refer you on what's happening then
In 93, had an idea we really believed in
94, 95 we began critiquing
In 96, I think we signed some bullshit
97, yo we had the number one hit
98, had to vacate to get our shit straight
Signed with Cool-to-love to get rid of one of the headaches
In 9-9, it's when them boys got signed
and if Nelly don't sell a record then it all goes down
0-0 through 0-1 we weren't below no one
and no one could ever take from or want more done
0-2, Lunatics sold damn near 2
So in 0-3, we gon see what Murphy Lee gon do

Lately I've been on the road
Can't say when I'm coming home
In and out the studio
That's the way the business go
Dealing with these bitches and niggas you never know
How this shit would end up like would end up after the show
By the way you smoke without a day
Got caught up on the highway
The cops tried to take me away
They weren't trying to hear what I had to say
I said these cops wouldn't let him go, we don't move no snow
I don't see what they see reason takes, my new tour
Search for us, never let us go
Cause he didn't find what he was looking for
Situation could of gotten out of control
But we made it through now it's time to roll
State to state to state we make so much of this hate
It's always strange to see what jealousy can create

Say boo you know it's real if you don't come home
When I call your phone ain't no plex in my tone
Hold this shit down leave your plex at home
Ain't bugging ain't tripping put you in the sex zone
When you hit the streets I know you giving them hell
Hit the studio make your pockets swell
Nigga knock but don't stop baby go on and mash
I'm down with my nigga we gone forever last
You chose me I chose you I ain't worried about no hoes
Got my name in your mouth don't let your mouth fall low
To a diamond baby, now go on and shine
I be here I'm you not so uh, smile for me now

Know what I'm saying boo, I ain't really tripping on you
Just keep it real with me, you a real nigga and all

We grow protrusions
That we can fly and fight in
In the labyrinth
We grow guns with bullets in
We've all got a game to play
And we all want to win
The world blows so cold
Around scores of concrete plinths
In the metropolis we live in
Stand the President's men

To win the prize I want to win

Naked plant on naked flesh
Wild essence in wild minds
Making love out of time
Blistered confusion in crystal caves
Shattered lights
Blow my hair in a trillion waves
The gauntlet of gold
Chariots of flames
The misty mountain kings lane
Hold my head to your scent
We will sway in the breeze
Whisper secrets and sweet sounds
Rings in the trees and our heads are crowned
Blistered confusion in crystal caves
Shattered lights
Blow my hair in a trillion waves
The gauntlet of gold
Chariots of flames
The misty mountain kings lane
Send me a city
And build it deep
Within the land
Where the real people sleep
The jewel and the grail
The eye in the ice
We'll watch the real people live their lives
Send me a city
An intrusion in time
We'll return to the darkness
Sad androids of mine
Orphans of technology
Orphans of technology
Wingless angels in soundless flight
Draw their swords
And lacerate the night

Making metallic chimes

See two lonely planets collide
Feel the children of our future curl and gnarl
Observing us all the time

Say, my vision today

Vision today is something to be followed

They scream ""aborted!""
Before birth can bring crime

I told my friends, but their reaction was so unkind

Just, vision today

My vision today is something to be followed.

I walk when it's dark, looking for a friend
Alone in the darkness, I see those things again
I see things I just cannot explain

I see strange things no-one can conceive
My mind explodes in inner visions
Then deludes and deserts me

Malignant violence grows
Frequencies visit in the night
Frequencies tell me, tell me again, I forgot
Those words delude and desert me
Malignant violence grows within
My ego expands

Should I take these foolish people, gas them for their sin?
Remove their memories, reprogram them to re-begin?
It makes my lonely mind explode
Should I take these foolish people, gas them for their sin?

Motionless waters on a cobbled street
Entwined like the double helix
The silence speaks

Shady faded city lights
Dark, dark tinted nights
Alone in an orgy of peace
The silence speaks

[Chorus]
Am the space between the sounds
Bathed in light
Am the space between the stars
Survived

Someone calls from across the street
Start the clock, start living again
And just as it starts to rain
The silence speaks

[Chorus]

When dreams connect and visions finally meet
Reality fades and fantasy supercedes
Tomorrow's a memory we all wish to reprieve
Tomorrow's a memory we finally receive

Car on impact
The glass cracks
Flesh and bones make contact

Am the space between the sounds
Was like a child
Bathed in light
In a new world
Survived
Words took form from nowhere
Am the space
So I could understand
Between the sounds
The sublime, the obscure
Bathed in light
Was a child
Survived
Brought into a new world
Am the space
Without form
Between the sounds
Nothing to see
Bathed in light
Nothing to learn
Survived
No synchronicity
Am the space
Everything is one
Between the sounds
I'd become the space between the sounds
Bathed in light
Survived

And the space between the sound looks down
And regards his disregarded body in the wreckage",Space Between the Sounds,1985

When you climb into your bed tonight
When you lock and bolt the door
Just think of those out in the cold and dark
Cause there's not enough love to go round
And sympathy is all you need my friend
And sympathy is all you need
And sympathy is all you need my friend
Cause there's not enough love to go round
Not enough love to go round
Half the world hates the other half
And half the world has all the food
And half the world lies down and quietly starves
Cause there's not enough love to go round
And sympathy is all you need my friend
And sympathy is all you need
And sympathy is all you need my friend
Cause there's not enough love to go round
Not enough love to go round

Toyah,"Where will you go, when the sirens blow?
Will you run helter-skelter, in search of a shelter
Or will you lie low?
Will you sit there clutching at your lucky charm
Or pray to your god to keep you from harm?
Maybe you'll believe it's just another false alarm
There's a world in action all around us
World in action for all to see
You'd better hide behind your religion
Is there a future for you or for me?
The devil's broken out, he's breaking deals
Disregard law and order, and head for the border
To hide in them hills
Will you sit there clutching at the final straw
Hoping that your ticket's in the final draw
If you read between the lines you'll discover there's a fatal flaw
There's a world in action all around us
World in action for all to see
You'd better hide behind your religion
Is there a future, is there a future?
World in action, world in action
And the leaders in the backroom are counting up the toll
It's defend or attack, no turning back
'Till it's out of control
Will you turn away and wash your hands
Or stand there shaking with your head in the sands?
Or leave it to the people who pretend they understand
There's a world in action all around us
World in action for all to see
You'd better hide behind your religion
Is there a future for you or for me?
World in action all around us
World in action for all to see
You'd better hide behind your religion
Is there a future, is there a future?

There's a house on the outskirts of Marlborough
Past the polly tea rooms
Hidden in the trees
That watch your every move
Consumed by birdsong
Over the bunker
Below radar
Away from the sports centre
City tip and parked cars.
Perched on a hillside
An undiscovered u.f.o.
A time thief
In mechanical conversation
Flashing beaming winking gleaming
At the gaping sky.
Throbbing with generation
Yet stalling your car
Burning all circuits
Among the standing stones
And old Sarum.
Real estate owner occupied
A growing concern
Attractive moods in the woodwork
Subsidence tolerated
The blinds hide the
Blushes fading adds maturity
Prime investment for the voyeur
Only jealously guarded.
The paint never peels
And the dust doesn't settle
On the linoleum-like substance
Across walls and floor.
Dark is the stage
No children live here
And no old die
Only silence prevails
Paranoid actors
Hide on the stairs
Little creatures
Cought in the thorns of the rose
Arbour helicopters, jets and siren
Wall reciting everry word that has
Ever brought a tree down
And bounce off the walls of the
Dream home whispering obscenities.

I cannot sleep
The saint in me eludes me
This man is not what I think
He is a halo of thorns,
Spear in his side
Coaxing me to earth
A parachute eclipses the sun
Hovers on the slipstream
Hangs on every note
He denies me his knowledge
Eyes piercing and eagle bright
Lifts me from my dull existence
Hurls me off the cliff
In clumsy flight
Falling to earth...
The air's so good it
Gives nutrients and
Your presence builds
As you rumble on down the corridor.
It's rockin' and I feel as if
I'm floatin' in water but
I'm not drowning
I must be there
In every moment
Ooooo
Ten thousand decibels so mean,
It pins me to all four walls
Opening up my secrets,
I'm exposing myself
So uncool,
I'm storm-torn but it's really exciting
Spread-eagle in the air
This telekinetic hold
Christ, he's the mirror that
Reflects my thoughts
And he's pulling me from the firmament
The sun goes behind the mountain and night eclipses
Oh god, I'm falling to earth....

Let the power bleed down on me
I feel dreadfully torn
Like a new-born
Deep unrest beneath the
Great great undressed stigmatism of flesh
Little little lady grow
Little little lady grow tall
Stand before it all
And roar the door
Before you grew from a seed to a tree
With timber cut life drained away
A barrier was made
Fly away phoenix love, love me do
Hold me close to you
Break my inhibitions
Let the kudos wake
Little little lady grow
Little little lady grow tall
Stand before it all
And roar, roar, roar.....
Let the power bleed
The cut beneath the skin never heals
A furtive glance from a stranger
Existence recognised body
Immortalised yes, there's a
Woman in those flames
Yes, that wreckage has a soul
And just a little self respect
Will make this baby whole again

Don't make it obvious anyway,

Envy scratches all down the side of the car
Flirt you're in the car in front

Her cigarette glows in the dark
I see my arm on the wheel
In the oncoming lights
Mascara black tears trickle down
It's not me, it's just meat that drives
Born by man captive and
Damned to shed this skin and
Enter you in the bliss of death
A soul bathed in fur
A heart robed in flesh
Whichever way you wear yourself
I'll get in

I leava a note in my pocket
Or on the table, or posted to a friend
To respect fate to let you know where I stand with you
If not in life, perhaps another time

Sensuality of tone
Twenty-two miles till the earth curves

Well you know I've been dloating here for hours
Just like this
Suspended gently swaying like a pendulum
Look, no strings attached
There's the odd insect
It don't worry traffic control
But I just don't seem to wake up
I've been all the way to Budapest
Seen riots, yes riots in Tibet
Seen the burning monks
Crackling in pain
Saw bombs in Gibraltar
Fear in Christ's eyes
Frozen in concrete
As all of Europe fries
Wake up a mother's son
Lynched in a graveyard
Bullets in MacDonald's
Mottos born to kill
Tattoed on children's skin
And when I saw the hole in the sky
At the north pole
I really wanted to wake up
I heard the last breath of the dolphin
Behind the doors on the fourth floor
Of a Manchester morgue
Little fingers on the durex machine
God bless them,
Yes God bless them
And God bless Milton Keynes

For thirty years

Seen nothing but soot covered misery
Witnessed crossbreeding giving birth to

It says

Lies a shady town in market garden land

I have laid across its stones
The back street pub where Bowie sang
""Is there life on Mars""

Pumped heroin into their veins
The girls, my friends determined
Not to succeed
Pregnant by unknown fathers by fourteen
Mocked me my ambition

Had us running scared

We'd steal our golden dreams

Ophelia can pretend
To be a priestess or a femme fatale
But Ophelia can't escape her shadow
A little purse of promises
With which to elope
A butterfly net and a killing jar
To silence all her hopes

Is haunting the humans
Ambushed by ghosts
And other aspects of her lonely heart

With which to elope

Or the queue of emotional debts
Nor the virtues, nor the vice
Sowing the seeds
Of the never never tree

Come, Ophelia

Talking down their telephones
Eating in their restaurants
Visiting their homes
Trying on their clothes
Wearing their skin and bones

Past the polly tea rooms
Hidden in the trees
That watch your every move
Consumed by birdsong
Over the bunker
Below radar
Away from the sports centre
City tip and parked cars.
Perched on a hillside
An undiscovered u.f.o.
A time thief
In mechanical conversation
Flashing beaming winking gleaming
At the gaping sky.
Throbbing with generation
Yet stalling your car
Burning all circuits
Among the standing stones
And old Sarum.

A growing concern
Attractive moods in the woodwork
Subsidence tolerated
The blinds hide the
Blushes fading adds maturity
Prime investment for the voyeur
Only jealously guarded.
The paint never peels
And the dust doesn't settle
On the linoleum-like substance
Across walls and floor.
Dark is the stage
No children live here
And no old die
Only silence prevails

Hide on the stairs

Cought in the thorns of the rose
Arbour helicopters, jets and siren

Ever brought a tree down
And bounce off the walls of the

Hovers on the slipstream
Hangs on every note

Stand before it all
And roar the door
Before you grew from a seed to a tree
With timber cut life drained away
A barrier was made
Fly away phoenix love, love me do
Hold me close to you
Break my inhibitions
Let the kudos wake
Little little lady grow
Little little lady grow tall
Stand before it all
And roar, roar, roar.....
Let the power bleed
The cut beneath the skin never heals
A furtive glance from a stranger
Existence recognised body
Immortalised yes, there's a
Woman in those flames
Yes, that wreckage has a soul
And just a little self respect
Will make this baby whole again
Fly away phoenix
Fly away phoenix

Baby, baby, baby, baby

Oh never mind
Pr..pr..pr..pressing my heel of my shoes
Into your paintwork
Shattering determination
Brick thoughts crumble
We've stood under this sky
Far too long baby
Come on meet your soul
Wife now, I don't believe you
Don't want to see me, come on baby.
Flash bulbs squeeze light

Across the blistering night
I arrest your image and
Detain
We're not waalking on safe land
We're sinking in quick sand
Obsession
Good god, have you seen that weirdo in the car behind
No, no don't look
Don't make it obvious anyway,
As I was saying
Envy scratches all down the side of the car
Flirt you're in the car in front
I think with someone else
Her cigarette glows in the dark
I see my arm on the wheel
In the oncoming lights
Mascara black tears trickle down
It's not me, it's just meat that drives
Born by man captive and
Damned to shed this skin and
Enter you in the bliss of death
A soul bathed in fur
A heart robed in flesh
Whichever way you wear yourself
I'll get in
Obsession
Every time I venture out
I leava a note in my pocket
Or on the table, or posted to a friend
To respect fate to let you know where I stand with you
If not in life, perhaps another time
Obsession
England this burning land
Sensuality of tone
Twenty-two miles till the earth curves
Then you're out of sight
I'll be clothed in confusion,
When I woke in this body
By my mother's side
Born from all
Seeing to one sight
I am all
I am in a microcosm of time before
I become one and all again
I want to experience
I want to walk all over you

Fingers cross my lips
Drawing pretty maps
With my bright red lipstick
Pictures of deviation
I read in the dictionary
That I'm a miscreation
A nonconformist
Make it quick, make it quick,
I make a livin' off-a this
This is your fifteen minute call ladies and gentlemen fifteen minutes.
Thank you.

Now don't quote Karl Marx to me
What's yours is yours,
What's mine is ours
When you touch me
I feel the media printing porn
Across my female form
Cigarette burns on your jacksaw chin
Come on man
I need a girl
If you can't do
What she can man.
They say, when something begins, there is no sin...
Na na don't use the back breaks honey
Forget my lips just let the muscle fix fit

Well you know I've been dloating here for hours
Just like this
Suspended gently swaying like a pendulum
Look, no strings attached
There's the odd insect
It don't worry traffic control
But I just don't seem to wake up
I've been all the way to Budapest
Seen riots, yes riots in Tibet
Seen the burning monks
Crackling in pain
Saw bombs in Gibraltar
Fear in Christ's eyes
Frozen in concrete
As all of Europe fries
Wake up a mother's son
Lynched in a graveyard
Bullets in MacDonald's
Mottos born to kill
Tattoed on children's skin
And when I saw the hole in the sky
At the north pole
I really wanted to wake up
I heard the last breath of the dolphin
Behind the doors on the fourth floor
Of a Manchester morgue
Little fingers on the durex machine
God bless them,
Yes God bless them
And God bless Milton Keynes
Now I've been floating here
For thirty years
>From the mid west to the North Sea
Seen nothing but soot covered misery
Witnessed crossbreeding giving birth to
Bad dreams now I want to wake up
Now I'm floating here on the outer atmosphere
And I've brushed aside the waste paper
There's a sign,
It says
""Self destruct in 99""
Evacuate.

I can feel summer at last from the heat
In the red-brick city
The evening light pulls a veil of linen
Over the night time
Life's a gas
Will I walk there again.
In the sleeping Vale of Evesham
Lies a shady town in market garden land
The abbey, demonic and provoking
I have laid across its stones
The back street pub where Bowie sang
""Is there life on Mars""
While the boys in the back room
Pumped heroin into their veins
The girls, my friends determined
Not to succeed
Pregnant by unknown fathers by fourteen
Mocked me my ambition
The tramp we thought we killed
Had us running scared
Deeper into night
>From fight to fight
The transport cafe from which
We'd steal our golden dreams
So few survived and
Those who have,
Have disappeared just flowers on their graves
Born with broken hearts yes,
Thank you world for my crucufied icons
Lovers of the impossible dream
T.V.'s suicides, mass sacrifice
We're just buzzing in the hive
Born with broken hearts.

Nice to see you wall
Good day at the office wall
Your dinner's on the floor darling
And scrape me off the ceiling

Where it complies
I compromise
I only wear this skin
'cause I sinned in m'past life
I want war
And you want me
I want war
And you want breakfast, lunch and tea
On stage please, on stage, thank you.
Sweat drips off my brow
I know my lines, my moves
My place in life
And it's ticking away
I'm not going on tonight

A void of nothing-ness
I'm dripping away

TQ,"Yeah, give it to me 
Yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
No, no, no, no 

Seems like every night right before I go to sleep 
I say a little prayer to the Lord that he keep me 
I used to be the kind of nigga that didn't give a fuck about nobody 
The slightest little thing would make me mad 
Especially if it involved my money 

And I can't tell you 'bout the next man 
But I love pullin' up in big sedans 
Wit' all my niggas in a caravan 
Holla if ya hear me 

Now I'd love to break ya, bring ya down 
And take you back again 
But that would take too much time 
And I gotta hit the streets again 

And even if the sun don't shine, I'll still be hustlin' 
Gotta get that money, make that money 
Keep it comin' if it takes all night, can't be strugglin' 
Somebody, come help me 
Can ya tell me why is slangin' always on my mind? 
Must be buggin' 
I guess they figured I would quit and they could get me 
If they tapped my line 
Don't mean nothin' 
I'll still be hustlin' 

Now I hate to be the one to tell ya, but I don't mind 
Niggas can hate if they want to 
And I'm still gon' get mine 
Yes, I still be ridin' in a S-C on dubs
And I won't be seen at none of the clubs 
And all your women would know who I was 
(And that you wouldn't like)
And that you wouldn't like 

If everybody kept they mind on gettin' they skrilla 
Won't be no time to fuck with mine, so won't be no killin' 
I'll just sit back and recline, smoke this Philly 
And keep my fingers laced with diamonds like Big Willie 

But for now, catch me on Compton Avenue 
With a handful of hundreds and a strap or two 
Puttin' it down for my niggas like they told me to 
You need some candy, so won't you come through 

And even if the sun don't shine, I'll still be hustlin' 
Gotta get that money, make that money 
Keep it comin' if it takes all night, can't be strugglin' 
Somebody, come help me 
Can ya tell me why is slangin' always on my mind? 
Must be buggin' 
I guess they figured I would quit and they could get me 
If they tapped my line 
Don't mean nothin' 
I'll still be hustlin' 

Sometimes I'm suited up 
Sometimes I'm bummy, lookin' like a crook 
Hair all nappy and wild

Throbbin', hoggin', and doggin'

'Cause I made it out the game without a clue or trace

I liked to sit up at the park & drink on St. Ides 
Drunk as fuck, I used to wonder why some niggas roll 64's on D's 
And some niggas let their khakis hang to their knees 
Will I end up just like one of these? 
Or smoke trees overseas and rock wimbley? 
Bring back a black Bentley full of Henessey

About the other side of the gang

This time it's just the way it happened
So listen closely, you might learn something
Check it out
 
I'm just sittin', smokin' weed and looking at some old pictures
From mom's house of when I was a young boy (When I was a young boy)
And the first one that I see is of me and Melinda
On the roof throwin' gang signs
The kind of homie that you don't find
But she always kept things on her mind
She never was my baby, we had a crush
When we were younger
We used to hump and that was it
No bullshit, she was eleven, I was ten
But she meant more to me than any woman since

[Chorus:]
Remember Melinda
I used to stay across the street from her
She could have been a supermodel
Don't remember doing shit without her
I often think about her
Remember Melinda
Never really found her way home
I loved her like my sister
Dear Lord I really miss her, one wish
Long as I live, I'll always remember Melinda

She always had a lot of drama
Watchin' daddy drunk, beating on mama
She used to stuff grams in her bra for my nigga Rob
Twistin' niggas was her job, married to the mob
I used to take her on runs with me
She'd sit in the passenger seat and count the funds for me
It's my fault, I introduced her to the game
To find out she couldn't hang, and it's a shame
That I remember when she started actin' crazily
Was first day she brought my yay to me
Let's get some yack because you made me now
The first lick is about to get paid now
But wait up, what's the deal why ain't you happy
Something's wrong and that's real an open package
That's when I finally realize
Melinda getting high off of my supply!

[Chorus]

And no I'll never forget the night
Her nose started bleeding, her eyes turned white
And I can't get it out of my mind
I'm telling you I still remember, yes I remember
12:30 on the dot here come the doc
The news he's bringing me, I'm shocked
Another victim, and I done made my self a killing
All for the love of drug dealing

Things can get back to the way they used to be 
You and me in a chromed out E-bumpin' Bone Thugs 
I got the pedal to the floor, dippin' kinda high and trippin', 
I really want to hit it, your shit is finger lickin' 

[Ericka:] 
Wait a minute I really miss you, so don't get me started 
The sweating, the bumpin', the grinding right through these bars and 
If I ever thought it would help you make it, just picture me naked 
Can't feel your body and I hate it, I'm going crazy 
Gotta get my mind off this, 'bout to go up to the mall and buy an outfit 

[TQ:] If you spend all my loot and I'm gonna be pissed, that's no bullshit 
[Ericka:] Now who in the hell do you think you're talking to, you know I'm the only one in the world who will put up with you 
[TQ:] Got 72 more days in here, it seems like 20 years, can't smoke, can't drink no beer, can't get no ass in here
So when I finally come home, it's gonna be on, 'cause I'm gonna be lickin' and kissing and sticking all week long, baby

[Chorus x 2]",When I Get Out,1998
TQ,"featuring Too $hort 



You know what? 

I'm 'bout to tell you some shit  that's gon' fuck you up 

That's real  why' ain't gon' like it 

Well  shit 

Fuck  that's the way it is  check it out 



Verse 1: TQ 



I like to think back to when we spent the weekend 

In Cabo baby  your sister's boyfriend started trippin' 

And left her lonely 

After you went to sleep   I spent the night out on the beach 

Laid up on her body - how could I keep from hittin'? 

And every time I came to your house 

She always kissed me in the mouth 

Always stickin' her tongue out when you wasn't lookin' 

I want to fuck you sister 



Chorus: TQ 



Now we been messin' round a long long time 

But now I want to fuck your sister 

And I know it sounds foul but that's alright 

Cause why should I have to bullshit ya' 

(play wit' ya) 

I can't help it if she's the one that's on my mind 

Everytime I'm out wit cha 

I know we messed around a long long time 

But now I want to fuck your sister 



Verse 2: TQ 



She comes to greet me when I ring your door bell 

Lookin' like cavvy 

She stands behind you in the kitchen - staring at me 

I like to see her when she's getting out the shower 

All the things she used to tell me when you wasn't listening 

Now the bridge is gonna get cha 



Bridge: TQ 



Ain't no need for us to stop messin' around 

I just want to hit it for an hour when she get out the shower 

On the sink guaranteed not to make a sound 

And you know you shouldn't have to be getting' mad at me 

I can't help if I want that ass badly 

So in the middle of the day when nobody else is around 

I'll be fucking your sister 



Verse 3: Too $hort (starts rapping during verse 2) 



It's time to wake up, control my own destiny 

Can't let my addiction to her get the best of me 

I ain't givin' up 

And I'll never stop tryin' live it up 

Cause there ain't no reason to be lyin' 

So you might as well let you know 

It's goin' down 

You wasting time asking me when, where or how? 

It's a mutual thing between me and your sister 

How you gon' feel when you seeing me kiss her 

Ever since she was young, I knew I would get her 

Waiting this long to fuck can only make it better 

It's like way back when I was tryin' to get wit' cha 

I'm tryin' to keep it real girl, I ain't tryin' to bullshit ya 

be	-ITCH!!! 



Too seezy up in this motherfucker

Then I get a little ass for me

Tell me nothin' good could come of it
But I always used to figure it was worth my while
That's why I had to hit this lick

I got the goods, but I think they heard me
Lord help me, can I get away?
Stashing stuff away

Will it be this bustin' ass ?, got on vests but we duck, gotta protect our head
It ain't no tellin' when niggas start actin' stupid
'Til they roll up on your block, wit glocks, scheme ass could start shootin'
You want to know what I'm doin'
Keepin' a weapon at all times
'cause shit, the broke niggas ain't got, they runnin' up lookin' around
And I think they really want it
But who want to come to get it
want to pay that unexpected visit to my crib for the riches
I tell 'em to bring it on
A nigga done worked to hard for this shit
Plus I'm a man and a captain goin' down with his ship
Let's do this, AK 47 spittin' it
When the situation get heated, we gon' be there
With the proper tools and equipment, never be slippin'
Ask me what I'm gon' do when the mob get to jumpin'
And gotta fight 'til it's over
If I don't make it, then I'll go down like a soldier

Even if they catch me homie, I gotta say somethin'
I won't live another day, and have nothin'

Plus I didn't like these niggas no way

See I done stole a lot of shit you think i'm giving it back

I bet you think about it on your way down (Just exposure homeboy)

We was nothin but little boys
But you was about 2 years older
Spending most of our time in trouble and
Listening to my mama straight scold us
Be in the house before 7:30
Go take a bath cause you're dirty
And put some more greens on your plate
We walked to school every morning
Scrappin with the niggas on the corner
And still we're never late
Used to write rhymes in the classroom
Rock shows in the bathroom (I charge a dollar)
You wanted to be like Ice Cube
I wanted to be like Iceberg Slim
Remember how we made them holler
Being a rap singer is all you talked about
You got a record deal I got kicked out
I saw your video couldn't believe
You was the same nigga did bang with me
And didn't look like you used to ride like we used to

After all these years (I had to keep the homies off of you)
Cause they sons in the school house trippin tryin to be like you
And its costing valuable time in they lives and mine
Thinkin that the only way you hot is if you rappin about the money you got
Nigga please you didn't always have cheese
Remember me I used to be with you
Used to slang weed in the street with you
Split the G with you
And I always believed in you
But now you switched up you on channel 2
Is them grindstones glued to your shoes?
Danced around lookin like a fool with your lip pierced
don't you ever try to come around here

The real you done got misplaced
Give me your neighborhood pass
Would you wack that ass

who's to blame for the shame on what people do for fame
To have a name in the game
No love for the music
Remember Marvin used to do it
This shit meant something and you knew it
(And we knew it damn we blew it) These days we only wishing
For top position and doin anything to get them

Waterproof knock in it, ain't no stoppin' it
Automatic respect whenever D-Block's in it
Or we can take it to the avenue too
And bring the Porsche GT out, lavender blue
Shit change, Kiss came and it's all extortion
Everybody eat except for smaller portions
For real though, behave yourself on some grown shit
It ain't enough room dawg, I'm on my own hit

What went wrong?
In the story of Angela Jones, now

Straight off the bat
Angie got the work
Winin' and dinin' and robbin' them jerks
She went from Gucci watches, humble beginnings
To that Cartier wrist wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women
Couldn't fuck with Angela
It was all in the waist n how she handled ya
Dog, I mean baby girl had that thing
That could knock ya ass clean out and take your chain
It's a shame all the things that child could do to you
She'd do that booty dance like Beyonce do
Cold with her hands and a twenty two
Just in case the night don't go like it's supposed to
Who'd be mad at Angie?
Not this kid
She just playin' with the hand she was dealt
And that's real
So when I read it in the paper
Who could I blame?
Hooker found slain
Angie's her name
What a shame

I'm like whoa, whoa, who's that girl?
She the baddest in the whole damn world
And you can call her when you're feelin' alone
This is the story of Angela Jones
I don't know (I don't know but)
What I've been told
Just get your money don't lose your soul
Sit back and ask yourself
What went wrong?
In the story of Angela Jones, now

I wish, I wish, I wish I could save ya (I wish I could save ya)
I wish I could make ya better (I wish I could a made it better for ya, baby)

TQ,"I'm a dog about it
And if you don't know then ask your friends
'cause I'm quite sure they heard about me
'cause some of them probably know first hand

And you ain't gotta worry bout your boyfriend
I never been the kind to kiss and tell
But check your rear-view when you're gonna see me
Girl make sure you ain't been tailed

That's enough about me, let's talk about you
And what you gona do when you come through
Rub on my back, mama check on my mic
Do I get breakfast in the morning in the sunlight?

Tell me what you got for me, what you got for me
What you got, baby won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
What you got, show me what you got for me, what you got for me?
What you got, mama won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
Show me what you got, show me what you got, show me what you got

No doubt about it
I represent the west till the wheels fall off
And I never smoke stress cause it makes me cough
I push a 63 Impala with the top cut off

I'm hittin' switches as I roll down past my block
And as a 118 to homies what's up
My girl blowin' me up when I finally pick up
She says she made at home and that she all alone and wanna bone

So, I jack him up movin' to the left like
Bust a you-turn now I'm dippin' on the freeway
Headin' out to Englewood, going to see my thang
Open the door to that G-String

Tell me what you got for me, what you got for me
What you got, baby won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
What you got, show me what you got for me, what you got for me?
What you got, mama won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
Show me what you got, show me what you got, show me what you got

A nigga been gone too long
Time for a brand new song, kick it in the shade and
Listen to the sounds of California
And I'ma give it to ya how ya want it

I drop a beat and put a fly hook on it
All by myself and I don't need no help
So I'll be damned if I'ma sit on a shelf
You got to give me what you got for me

What you got for me
What you got, baby won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
What you got, show me what you got for me, what you got for me?
What you got, mama won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
Show me what you got, show me what you got, show me what you got

Take it to the bridge again
Get all of my folks a new phone
Tell em I'm about to come home
And I'm bringing big money

And I bring a big drink and I'm tryna warn ya
Block party baby, meat on me
But my grandmamma peach cobbler fire believe me
And I'm sippin' on Hen with all my friends
Boppin' gap band out the Benz, give me what you got for me

What you got for me
What you got, baby won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
What you got, show me what you got for me, what you got for me?
What you got, mama won't you shake it for me, what you got for me?
Show me what you got, show me what you got, show me what you got

What you got for me
What you got, baby come and you shake it for me, what you got for me?

Love is color-blind

I remember when,
I was a child and couldn't understand
People having fun
Discriminating all the different ones
Mama just used to say
When you grown up you'll maybe find a way
To make these people see
That everything I do

They gotta live their life
We're all the same no one's to blame
They gotta live their lives

All that matters in the very end
Is to understand
Love is color-blind

I remember as a young boy
I watched my neighborhood go up in flames
I saw the whole thing through tears of pain
And a situation´s rackin' my brain
I wish I could fly away and never come back again
We need some love y'all
We need some real deal help from above y'all
I mean the kids watchin'
And i just can't see it stoppin' I don´t understand
I mean we all bleed the same blood, man!

You gotta live your live

Take it out to the world
Tell every boy 
And every little girl
Be proud of yourself

Put away your prejudice
Open your mind don't needs to sick to this
Try to make this earth
A better place without a racial curse

in a discotechque, don't tell me ladies can't take it 

Just to have my drawers in a overcoat 

My El Dorado lean, the black Caddy float 

down the hill with Frankie Dolla Bill 

Honies in red zone, tell me how them drawers feel 

Suckin on the hippie, on the Mississippi 

Econo Lodge, a cheap way to get a quickie 

Five and five, equal ten 

Add twenty up, I'm back in the spot again 

Blowin it up, I drop my own bomb 

Two big green mitts, and tails on my arm 

You in my way my man, yo be	 excuse me 

I didn't call your girl, why accuse me? 

I think you're insecure, not sure 

if your girlfriend's home, if she's knockin at my door 

Back in your ride, no apartment, no place to wash 

You can't clean, tell em black 

He don't know yet, my discipline, how to act 

Stack with fume, and twenty-four flicks 

You can't win, takin shots like the Knicks 

I'm old enough with skills to be your daddy 

Go ask grandma, your freaky Aunt Sally 

Pretty woman standin there with her ugly man

My wicky wicky style is unbearable for this world and the planet boy
I swing at the store, buy a lunch, play lacroix
Supercat chasin rats, with chemicals at the bottom
I'm givin gold with enzymes, connections i got em
One thing, two things, like ? blow casey
Recto and smekto, go get my boy luce (let's go!)
Let's see babe grim and his exoskeleton
He's pitchin a fastball, you swing and you miss
But seven times away clown, you're smellin the piss
Drippin offa your forehead, rollin down to new mexico
You're caught in a bid troop, you thought you was flexible
X-able, montreal expos
Hypodermic you turn it, you pick it up and you learn it
Now you're chillin with zinc as it kicks with the sodium
Pele came down just to sign some autographs
He laughed and he left, went to el segundo
For cheese and some bacon my philadelphia steak 'em
I got a hole in my pants, i said, ""asalaam alaikum""
Got a new jacket was breakin out to the trainin camp
I danced and danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced.. then i sat on the toilet!
Wrote a rhyme and then ordered, now i'm spinnin and winnin
Got the girlies up on it, cause i'm kickin and stickin
Finger-poppin and lickin, can you do me a favor
Can you go get the chicken - as you see we're a legion
When we roll we're just easin, up to egypt and pakistan
There's never no treason, cause we're -- ""treated with respect""

Dr. smith, i'm dope, yo watch sparky lyle
As i throwback a spitball, my slider and check back
The stadium's packed rope, the people should get back
And walk to the plate, yo jerry grody, pause
Swing swing swipe! i get mc's on my third strike
My hot dog is done, i'm in the dugout, check it
I know i wreck shop, tip-top, heads bop, heads drop
And many rappers get senile
Back to the plate, see the catcher, pitcher
You in the audience man, you be the fan
Like supercat, don don dada
I play the field in new york, and hit jamaica

Through molecules, a steel wall interphase

Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse

Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine eight seven six
Five four three - the chain reaction
Triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast
Yes approximate, green in the chambers
The lights came on, infrared and exciting
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams
Beams beams beams beams beams beams
Beams beams beams...
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean the phantom
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to persia
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker

Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compassionate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was counting me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

TRA-Knox,"[Verse 1]
Yo, yo forget the club
Today we play in the block
It's going down and it's blazing hot
Jeff pop the new CD turn tables joints
You just got to get the amps from Boogie
Get the van from Rock and then
Call up Ishcabibble's, Jim's and Pat's
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sending 'em back
And get my mic right
If I get hyped, I might rap
Then take the speakers find a good spot
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top
You want to come, you got to come on your feet
Ain't nothing like having a party
When it's out in the street, come on

[Chorus: Tra-Knox]
Nine o'clock I'ma call my crew
And ten o'clock we gonna roll on through
I don't know what you goin' do
But whatever you do, hit the block party tonight

All the ladies rolling up with friends
And don't be late or you won't get in
Our party's packed from beginning to end
Everybody tell a friend that the block party's tonight

[Verse 2]
It's ain't nothing like
Having a party on the block
When everybody know everybody on the block
And everybody on the block
Come to the party on the block
And when the sun drop, (we don't stop)
Funny how fast they travel the word
A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard
That it's a block party down in West Philly
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy
Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap
Jeff got it, jam packed
Everybody, hands in the air
(Just get your hands in the air!)
Yo Philly! (that's where the party's at!)
D.C. why y'all! (that's where the party's at!)
A-T-L (that's where the party's at!)
West side! (that's where the party's at!)
Mid-west why yall (that's where the party's at!)
Dirty South now (that's where the party's at!)
Yo, I can't hear why yall! (that's where the party's at!)
Where ever we at! (that's where the party's at!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo and when the sun drop
Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop
All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on
All day long I been plotting on this nice john
It's ten o'clock now Jeff is trying to hype me
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?
Hear the crowd cheer, brought a little smile out
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out
I know he's old, but
Maybe it's a slight chance
I could get my brother hype
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not
Lemme get the crowd jumping
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something
I'm like Rob Base- I want to rock right now
why yall know who run the block right now
All we need is a mic and a beat
And a couple of speakers
And some turn tables out in the street, come on!

TRA-Knox,"I believe in God
I believe in Destiny
Not Destiny in the sense of all of our Exerts being pre-determined
But Destiny in the Sense of our ability to choose
Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I was Born to reign
Point Blank
My name to be etched in stone
My destiny preordained
Trying to live righteous
Fighting for life, this my life
That's why I liked on my vices
Tightening the vices of truth on the roofless
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi
You and your boys trying to decide, what to write
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged
Young minds getting gorged Stakes have been altered
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exalted
As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid
On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz,
But your like a syringe now proud of your binge.

Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen
Giving false accounts of your account's amounts
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish
From the Terrace I see the fire burning the streets but I won't shield my eyes to the heat
Born to reign

I was Born to reign

Uh, check, check
Yo, yo, yo
Across the room shared a little gaze with me
Crazy mama how your scent played with me
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me
Didn't even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man
I put my finger up don't say nothing
He ain't here is he? We can play or something
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him
Us could be just a weekend thing
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma
Look we can have everything else
But for tonight let me have you for myself
Girl holla at me

Cause I thirst to tape connect her
I know you got a life momma
Trust me I don't want to bring your life drama
I can barely hear my think slide with me
Dip out the side door take a ride with me
Let me hear about (Uh)
What you think about (Uh)
What you need to do (Uh)
The things you dream about
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at
Let it ring ma call him back
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you
Am I goin' be at home alone with a glass slipper
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella

Man, I had some fun in the streets
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets
By 18, I started seeing the sun in the streets

My mom started trippin' on me
Like Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully
Like, I trust you but please call me
And when you have kids of your own you'll see
I'ma be here when all your friends won't

But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand
Now here I am with a family runnin' the lines she ran on me
We ain't always see eye to eye but Mom, on your principles
Now I rely, you got me tastin' my toes

I didn't know
Momma told me don't go down that road
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So take your fool telling me I told you so

I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck
Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck
My Mommy really liked this dude named Chuck
She thought he was really and polite, Chuck

And me used to roll out faithfully, inevitably
You see Chuck, you gon' see me
Like we on TV, the bosom is the buddy
Share food, clothes, and money, and hunnies

Flock like we was players from the NBA
Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say
To this girl named Mya
I was diggin', he told her I was a liar

Told her I be cheatin' on women
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'
He told her her life would be better with him in it
That's the friend I chose

I didn't know
Momma told me don't go down that road
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So take your fool telling me I told you so

Momma used to say, ""Take your time young man
I ain't always gonna be there , holding your hand
But, you'll always know exactly where I am
And when I'm not there in my place the Lord will stand

Will study the world, only the wise succeed
And when you're eyes tell lies your heart should lead
You're gonna do dirt we all gon' sin
But when you realize it, apologize and never do it again

Mom told me don't rush to get old
If you got youth, truth clutched in your hold
It's like possibilities too much to behold
An emotional shield from life's blustery cold

Mom, all this stuff was hard you said was hard
Childish disregard 'cause my head was hard
Now, no question opposed, ugh

Trace Adkins,"Well my heart didn't skip a beat
When I saw you standing there
Looking like some kind of angel
Like you were walking on air
And the earth didn't move
When you first said my name
I didn't feel a thing, no not me,
My heart didn't skip a beat

This ain't no love song
I just felt getting my guitar on and singing a tune
Singing about you yeah
Feeling good and tapping my shoes
And all this stuff I'm making up well you probably
Won't be hearing it on the radio but then you never know

So baby if you want
You can sing along
But this ain't no love song

I couldn't sleep last night
But you weren't on my mind
And I went for a drive last night
But if you saw me driving by
Well I must've took a wrong turn
I must've been thinking bout something else
Had a melody in my head yeah maybe that's why
I couldn't sleep last night

This ain't no love song
I just felt like getting my guitar on and singing a tune,
Singing bout you, feeling good and tapping my shoes
And all this stuff I'm making up well
You probably won't be hearing it on the radio but then you never know

So baby if you want you can sing along
But this ain't no love song, love song,
Love song singing to you baby singing to you baby
All night long

Yeah half this stuff I'm making up well
You probably won't be hearing it on the radio
But then you never know

Don't push me away there's nothing to hide
I won't betray you baby
I love you babe i'm on your side

Remember how we kissed the first time in the dark
Your lips were on my lips your heart was on my heart
But last night when you went to sleep
You turned your face to the wall

I'll catch you when you fall

Trace Adkins,"I been thinkin' 'bout our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense

This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing

Forget mathmatical equations

Gray matter don't matter much darlin'
When it's gettin' down to you and me, oh

And that makes three days in a row
Now that you're tired of pretending
It's time that I let you know

I don't disagree with your feelings
We both need to find a new life
But this ain't the way we should end it
It's a bad way of saying goodbye

There must be a better way of sayin' it's over
Where nobody walks away with tears in their eyes
When you stay 'til regret is all you have left
That's a bad way of saying goodbye

When I think of you I'll remember
How you looked at me when we met
But the way that you're looking at me now
I'll do my best to forget

It's not your fault, but it's not mine
We both made mistakes though we tried
So leaving without saying I'm sorry
Is a bad way of saying goodbye

I gotta be more careful in a crowd
If you caught me talkin' to myself
Don't mind me, I'm dreaming out loud

I can't stop wondering what did I do wrong
To lose the only one I cared about
If I do my living in the used-to-be
Don't mind me, I'm dreaming out loud

All I hear is her whisper my name
All I see is her hair tumble down
When I feel the touch of her hand in mine
I find I'm dreaming out loud

Well, I'd better be going, got some place to be
I know she's somewhere in this town
And until I find her and she comes back to me 
I'll be dreaming out loud

Trace Adkins,"I told you I'd leave a light on
In case you ever wanted to come back home
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture
I took your every word to heart
'Cause I can't stand us being apart
And just to show how much I really miss ya

Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone
Every light in the house is on

If I should ever start forgetting
I'll turn the lights off one by one
So you can see that I agree it's over
But until then I want you to know
If you look south, you'll see a glow
That's me waiting at home each night to hold ya

Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone

Trace Adkins,"From the time you were a baby
You've had this notion in your head
Someone would come along and sweep you off your feet
Like in all those storybooks you read
Well if you're lookin' for perfection
Like some damsel in distress
Well there ain't no heroes on white horses
At least I ain't seen 'em yet

There ain't no knights in shinin' armor
Ain't no never, never land
I won't ever walk on water
But I can only love you like a man

Heaven knows I'm no angel
Just flesh and bone like all the rest
I never claimed to have a halo
All I can give you is my best
But I will never try to hurt you
Or even give you cause to doubt 
That my heart is yours forever
Ain't that what true love's all about

Trace Adkins,"Well boys I hate to leave good company
But my baby just called me on the phone
And from the sound of her voice, I simply have no choice
I left something turned on at home

Well I just put a quarter in the jukebox
And it ain't halfway through my favorite song
But if I don't leave right now my whole place might burn down
'Cause I left something turned on at home

It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open, the house is probably smokin'
'Cause I left something turned on at home

Hey waitress could you cancel that order
But if it's too late I'll take it to go
Boys I gotta run 'fore somebody calls 911
'Cause I left something turned on at home

It ain't the stove, it ain't the heater
She's hotter and a whole lot sweeter
And all day long she's been there alone
Right now her arms are open, the house is probably smokin'

Trace Adkins,"I don't know what you had in mind
When you whispered those words to me
Maybe some fun, maybe someone
To be with temporarily
But if you keep making me feel this good
Whenever I'm close to you
It's only fair I make you aware
Of what you're 'bout to get into

If I fall you're goin' with me
It's a long way down
And I ain't about to go it alone
If I give all my heart
You better get ready
'Cause you're goin' with me
If I fall

Now I'm not sayin' it's all your fault
But what's a man supposed to do
Tryin' to play it safe gets harder every day
With a woman like you
Maybe you don't know what dangerous ground
That you're walkin' on now
But every time your lips touch my lips
You're closer to finding out

Trace Adkins,"Some people say fallin' in love is purely chance
The random blend of time and place, circumstance
That couldn't be farther from the truth
'Cause with you

It wasn't the stars in the sky
That got to me that night
Or the music that we were dancing to
It wasn't the moon up above
That had me falling in love
It was more than all those things alone could do
It was you

I do believe we're all a part of some greater plan
That only angels in our hearts can understand
Somehow I know I'd found my place

She left her lady razor
She left a note that I can't explain
On the refrigerator
She left a book she's been reading for days
Beside her chest of drawers
She left her nightgown hanging
Behind the bathroom door
But she left me no choice as far as I can tell
When it comes to getting over her
She didn't leave me a chance in hell

How does she think we're gonna pay those bills
When all I can afford is a two room shack
I took her to the moon and I can't bring her back

Now where did my fishing magazines go
Everywhere I look there's another Cosmo
Flowers in the kitchen and a new bedspread
Now you tell me, was it something I said
Even old blue's taking it rough
She clipped his nails and powdered him up
Her mind's running on a one way track

The one who said we'd better take it slow
What on earth do I do now
To put her feet back on the ground

She goes to the mall but she never says why
She brings home things that a man won't buy
I've already told her enough's enough
Now what are we gonna do with all this stuff
She bought a bunch of soap that she won't let me use
A toilet seat cover and hand towels too
The kind you don't touch, just leave 'em on the rack

Sits a photograph
Of my wife and kids

Where I keep my wedding ring and stuff
And some nights it still keeps me up

Cotton sheets dancin' 
On her mama's clothesline in my head

It's been like this 'round here for a long, long time
We haven't had the chance to meet
But I've heard about you on TV
And I think we're gonna get along just fine
I can't help but notice, you look somewhat surprised
Did ya think son, after what you've done, the Lord would let you slide?

[Chorus:]
Welcome to Hell, your new home
You did the crime now you'll do the time
Right where you belong
Welcome to Hell, end of the line
Your final sin, got you in
And now your soul is mine
Welcome to Hell

I hope for your sake you're the kind
That can stand to burn, burn 'till the end of time
'Cause that's exactly what you're gonna do
There's some lots left on the lake of fire
Where we send your kind to retire
And I picked out a nice little hot spot just for you
I got one last thing to tell ya
And let me make this clear
I don't know what you've been told, but there ain't no virgins here

[Chorus:]

Welcome to Hell, boy

Welcome to Hell, end of the line
Your final sin, got you in
And now your ass is mine

You're gonna love it",Welcome to Hell [#],2003
Trace Adkins,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2004
Trace Adkins,"I can't hide the way I feel about you anymore
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore
My tears no longer waiting, my resistance ain't that strong
My mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore

Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel about you
'Cause there's no one else I swear that holds a candle anywhere next to you
My heart can't take the beating, not having you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending I don't love you anymore

I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life

My tears no longer waiting, oh my resistance ain't that strong
But my mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore

Trace Adkins,"Bobby played his guitar on the harder side of town,
where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money.
He had dedication.
He had the heart and soul.
Somehow knew he was born to play.

People said, ""Get a real job, support your family,
'cause there's no future in the road you're takin'.""
He never said a word.  The dreamer just kept on.
Later at night you could hear him sing.

He said, ""I'm gonna be somebody.
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains.
I'm gonna be somebody someday.
You can bet your hard earned dollar I will.

The road was a struggle, it took him ten years to the top,
but now he's number one on the stage and the radio.
Still he can't believe how people come from miles around,
when it seemed like only yesterday,

He would say, ""I'm gonna be somebody.
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains.
I'm gonna be somebody someday.
You can bet your hard earned dollar I will.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bobby played his home town one full moon August night,
when he heard a voice in the front row singin'.
It was a sandy haired rebel boy with the same old hungry eyes.
He looked up at Bobby and said,

""I'm gonna be somebody.
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains.
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

Like Roy Acuff and George Jones
Lord, I loved to hear 'em
But I really got excited 'bout the time I turned 15

They put some drive in their country that really turned me on

The gigs were packed and I was nervous
Cause I wanted folks to like my tunes

They were all about my age

I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown
They gave me this plot of land
Me and some other men, for a job well-done
There's a big white house
Sits on a hill just up the road
The man inside
He cried the day they brought me home
They folded up a flag and told my mom and dad
We're proud of your son

And I'm proud to be
On this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground
And I'm in the best of company
I'm thankful for those thankful
For the things I've done
I can rest in peace
I'm one of the chosen ones
I made it to Arlington

I remember daddy brought me here when I was eight
We searched all day
To find out where my grand-dad lay
When we finally found that cross
He said, ""Son this is what it costs
To keep us free""

Now here I am, a thousand stones away from him
He recognized me on the first day I came in
And it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels
And saluted me

And I'm proud to be
On this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground
And I'm in the best of company
I'm thankful for those thankful
For the things I've done
I can rest in peace

I know they brought another hero home to us

Trace Adkins,"I met a guy on a red-eye, he spotted my guitar and said what do you do
I said, I sing for a living, country music mixed with a little rock and a 
little blues.
He said, I'm sorry, but I've never been crazy ‘bout that twang, and trains, and 
hillbilly thangs
What ever made ya wanna sing stuff like that

Chasing down a dream
I thought I knew what I was looking for

There's a girl in Texas
There's a girl in Texas

And you sure light up the night
I'm a lonely man but I'm leaving here alone

That I can't give, that I don't really own... cause

Ever sets me free

On how much drink a guy could hold 
And I held my own 
Learn to hold my own 

Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant 
Mama taught the Sunday bible class 
For eighteen years I remember thinkin' 
There was more to life than that 
So I ran the streets to beat the Devil 
Goin' just as fast as I could fly 
'Cause I came here to live 
I didn't come here to die 

Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on 
Worried about her little boy 'til I got home 
Daddy he'd say listen son 
But back then there wasn't much 
That I didn't already know 

I reckon I was doing close to 80 
When I felt the tire slip out from under me 
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus 
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me 
And He found me upset down in a ditch 
Smokin' gas in my eyes 
And He said son you came here to live 
You didn't come here to die 

Sunday morning I got up and I went to church 
That summer I got a job and I went to work 
Met a girl in town put some money down 
On a little house with a yard 

Our little boy was due in September 
But he came early in July 
For eighteen days all I remember 
Was settin' there at his side

That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I wanna heart that beats and bleeds

I wanna care, I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I just wanna feel somethin'

If you're tellin' me that's just how it is
I don't buy it 'cause once I was kissed
By a red-headed girl with cherry lips
On her porch when I was sixteen
And I felt it somewhere in my soul, and time stood still, and I couldn't let go
I can't tell you 'cause I don't know how I got so cold
When did I get so cold?

I just wanna feel somethin'
Somethin' that's a real somethin'
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
Run my fingers through your fingers
Across your face and through your hair
And close my eyes and breathe you in like air
I just wanna feel somethin'

I hate that I'm jaded and I make you cry
But still you stick around me, only God knows why
Damn it all to hell, I'm done

Trace Adkins,"(This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there)

She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie
Mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight A's, most likely to succeed

They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down south for some higher education
Put her on the fast track, to a law degree

Now she's comin' home to visit
Holdin' the hand
Of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmer's tan

And she's ridin' in the middle of his pickup truck
Blarin' Charlie Daniels, yellin', ""Turn it up!""
They raised her up a lady
But there's one thing they couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

(You know it's true)

Yeah, you know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
In their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty

They never understand
Why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches
And a southern boy drawl

Or why she's ridin' in the middle of a pickup truck
Blarin' Hank Jr., yellin', ""Turn it up!""
They raised her up a lady
But there's one thing they couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

(Oh, get country with it)

You can train 'em
You can try to teach 'em right from wrong
But it's still gonna turn 'em on

When they go ridin' in the middle of a pickup truck
Blarin' Lynyrd Skynyrd, yellin', (Turn it up!)
You can raise her up a lady
But there's one thing you just can't avoid
Ladies love country boys

But he's gonna make it right 'fore the day is done

I step out of the shower steamin' up the place
Wipe off the mirror, shave my baby face
Can't help but smile, hey what can I say

Slip my rings on my fingers, my new shades

I guarantee it's gonna be a helluva ride
I got my groove on, I got my smooth on

Flip my keys to the valet and I'm ready to roar
They're gonna know the second I strut through the door
I got my game on

Trace Adkins,"She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying ""I can't wait to turn eighteen""
She said ""I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules""
Momma put the car in park out there in front of the school
She kissed her head and said ""I was just like you""

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her ""It's a nice place""
She says ""It'll do for now""
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head and says ""Baby, just slow down""

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Five years later there's a plumber workin' on the water heater
Dog's barkin', phone's ringin'
One kid's cryin', one kid's screamin'
She keeps apologizin'
He says ""They don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's thirty six, one's twenty three
Huh, it's hard to believe, but

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast

Lord have mercy how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk, aw son

Now honey you can't blame her for what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her for working that moneymaker

We hate to see her go but love to watch her leave with that

Oh that's what I'm talkin' 'bout right there

We don't care about the drinkin', barely listen to band

What mattered then kept changing every day

[Chorus]
But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids please lord
That's all I ask for any more

Now a days it's crazy how
A passing storm, a siren sound
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home

Trace Adkins,"I was there in the winter of '64
When we camped in the ice at Nashville's doors
Three hundred miles our trail had lead
We barely had time to bury our dead
When the Yankees charged and the colors fell
Overton hill was a living hell
When we called retreat it was almost dark
I died with a grapeshot in my heart

Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home 'til the last shot's fired

In June of 1944
I waited in the blood of Omaha's shores
Twenty-one and scared to death
My heart poundin' in my chest
I almost made the first seawall
When my friends turned and saw me fall
I still smell the smoke, I can taste the mud
As I lay there dying from a loss of blood

Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home 'til the last shot's fired

I'm in the fields of Vietnam,
The mountains of Afghanistan
And I'm still hopin', waitin' prayin'
I did not die in vain

Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun

She used me like a razor blade, to cut the ties that bind
Freed herself from daddy's world, got tangled up in mine
It caught her by surprise
When she found herself in love
Found out two weeks, on Bodcau Creek
Just wouldn't be enough

A lazy Sunday afternoon
Caught the race in Talladega
Comin' round lap twenty-two
When the fella in the blue car
Gave the red car a little tap
Then a rainbow of colors
Went flippin' down the track
In what hat announcer called a spectacular crash
(And I thought) 

Well hell, I can do that
What's the big deal?
Hit a wall in a ball of fire requires no skill
A hundred thousand fans
Screamin' in the stands
He gets a bag full of cash
To drive in circles and crash
Hell, I can do that

While they were under caution 
I switched it back to the football game
My team was losin'
Coach was hangin' his head in shame
Then they gave thirty-two the football
And he hit the hole fast
Between him and the goal line
Wasn't nothin' but grass
Then he tripped on his own two feet
Fell flat on his back 

(And I said)

Well, hell, I can do that
Man, what's the big deal
If all they want is stumbling', fumblin' skills

To sit out the second half

Remote in her hand, tears in her eyes from a movie
A romantic comedy, starring Matthew McConaughey

We're gathered up in here today to join in holy monogamy
This here feller and this ol' gal that he brought with him.""
The weddin' chapel couldn't get more packed
The love birds were dressed in white and black
The preacher turned to the groom and asked
him to skip the ring on her left hand
He turned to his best man and said

Hold my beer
This won't take long
And I want it back
And I don't want it gone
I trust ya, buddy, here
Hold my beer

""I now pronounce you, y'all""

They cut the cake and they poured champagne
They macarana'd and formed a train
But it crashed right into the groom's old flame
As she came crashin' in
The new bride just kinda grinned and said 

Hold my beer
This won't take long
And I want it back
And I don't want it gone
I trust ya, honey, here
Hold my beer

When the cat fight broke up
The band broke into some Haggard and Hank and some Cash
When somebody's cousin that nobody knew
Yelled, ""What's with this hillbilly crap?""

It's raining here but I'm keeping dry

Trace Adkins,"One day shy of eight years old, my grandma passed away
I was a broken hearted little boy, blowing out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go, with a cold and lonesome rain,
Mamma smiled, said don't be sad child, grandma's watching you today

Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven
And her tears are pouring down,
That's how you know she's watching,
Wishing she could be here now,
And sometimes if your lonely,
Just remember she can see,
There's holes in the floor of heaven,
And she's watching over you and me,

Seasons come, and seasons go, nothing stays the same
I grew up, fell in love, met a girl who took my name
Year by year, we made a life, in this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together, Lord, I sure do miss her now

But there's holes in the floor of heaven,
And her tears are pouring down,
That's how I know she's watching,
Wishing she could be here now,
And sometimes when I'm lonely,
I remember she can see,
There's holes in the floor of heaven,
And she's, watching over you and me,

Well my little girl is twenty three, I walk her down the aisle
It's a shame her mom can't be here now, to see her lovely smile
They throw the rice, I catch her eye, as the rain starts coming down
She takes my hand, says daddy don't be sad,
Cause I know mamma's watching now

And there's holes in the floor of heaven,
And her tears are pouring down,
That's how you know she's watching,
Wishing she could be here now,
And sometimes when I'm lonely,

We gathered round your grave to grieve.

Try not to worry 'bout a whole lot
And I have no regrets for what it's worth

And I'm just proud to be here

I'd like to thank my guardian angels
God must have sent His best

No cowboys out in Texas, no wheat fields in Kansas
No Colorado skies of blue

No mountains in Montana, red clay in Alabama
No bluegrass in Kentucky, Vegas won't be lucky
And Memphis won't be home of the blues

Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending his beloved son
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day
In Bethlehem upon that morn,
There was a blessed Messiah born
The night before that happy tide
The noble Virgin and her guide

Were long time seeking up and down
To find a lodging in the town
But mark right well what came to pass
From every door repelled, alas
As was foretold, their refuge all
Was but a humble ox's stall
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
To whom God's angel did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear

Arise and go, the angels said
To Bethlehem, be not afraid
For there you'll find, this happy morn
A princely babe, sweet Jesus, born
With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went the babe to find
And as God's angel had foretold
They did our Saviour Christ behold
Within a manger he was laid
And by his side a virgin maid

Attending on the Lord of Life
Who came on earth to end all strife
There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah lay
They humbly cast them at his feet
With gifts of gold and incense sweet",Wexford Carol,2013

Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

I'll find my limo driver 
Mister, take us to the show 
I done made some plans for later on tonight 
I'll find a little queen 
And I know I can treat her right.

What's your name? 
Shootin' you straight, little girl? 
Won't you do the same?

Back at the hotel 
Lord we got such a mess 
It seems that one of the crew 
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes 
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar 
What a shame 
Won't you come upstairs girl 
And have a drink of champagne

What's your name, little girl? 
What's your name? 
Shootin' you straight, little girl? 
For there ain't no shame.

Nine o'clock the next day 
And I'm ready to go 
I got six hundred miles to ride 
To do one more show, oh no 
Can I get you a taxi home 
It sure was grand 
When I come back here next year 
I want to see you again

Just down the road man it's a game that I can't win

Go find a spot there in the shade
Throw a blanket down

Hid it in the moss at the foot of the bluff
Later on when that old moon shines
We can tip it back
And catch a buzz by the creek
Beat the heat
Sit on that rock and let our feet hang

Hey baby, what do you say we take a walk
Get gone?
Maybe find a place where we can get lost
Later on
Be one
With the stars in the dark
And hang

Midnight song of the whip-poor-ill
Third cup of that homemade wine
Don't you wanna know how that feels on out there?
Middle of nowhere
Where you can let your long, honeysuckle hair hang

But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2006
Tracey Arbon,"Nobody can tell ya;
There's only one song worth singin',
They may try and sell ya,
'Cause it hangs them up to see someone like you.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
You're gonna be knowing
The loneliest kind of lonely,
It may be rough goin',
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
So if you cannot take my hand,
And if you must be goin',
I will understand.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.",Make Your Own Kind of Music [Beautiful Thing Mix],2005
Tracey Campbell,"When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up, to more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up, to more than I can be

There is no life no life without its hunger
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly
But when you come and I am filled with wonder
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
And I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up, to more than I can be
You raise me up, to more than I can be",You Raise Me Up,
Tracey Campbell,"I've dreamed of you
Always feeling you
Were there
And all my life
I have searched for you
Everywhere
I caught your smile
In the morning sun
I heard your whisper
On the breeze of night
I prayed one day
That your arms would hold me tight
And just when I
Thought love had passed me by
We met
That first look
In your eyes
I can't forget
You melted me
With your tender touch
I felt all fear and sorrow
Slip away
Now here we stand
Hand in hand
This blessed day
I promise you
As I give to you
My heart
That nothing in this world
Shall keep us apart
Come happily ever after be
The man I'll love
Until the very end
I've dreamed of you
My great love
And my best friend
For god must know
How I love you so
He's blessed us here today
As man and wife

As I've dreamed of you
All my life
Come dream with me
As I've dreamed of you

	   y'all niggas is fucked up, word up
	    It's aight though, Imma get to the bottom of this shit
	    Check it

L.:  Yo what the fuck is
	I go uptown to collect these checks
	Come back to find my man body in blood, shit stretched
	Across the pavement 
	I know one of y'all know some information
	So Imma get down to the bottom of this whole situation
	Who shot the LR?  Was it you, Rock?
Rock:  Don't look at me, Oc!
	I don't believe you think I
	Shoot niggas on my team
	We grew up on the same block
	Set up weed spots together
	Stacked a good amount of cheddar
	Cracked a few brews, so never would I do that to my reverend 
	This crime, nobody witnessed?
L.:  Rock, my only lead is this photo if him kissin this mistress
	That I found at the scene
Rock:  Hold up, she used to live around my way
	Yo, shit is fucked up
	I think I need a drink, pass the Cavasiaa
L.:  Aight, I hear you kid
	But if you didn't, nigga who did?
	This bullshit, I ain't buyin it
	Mr. Lee?
Mr. Lee:  Don't even try it son
	My life is private
	I handles my be	-I, then I'm slidin
	Fuck it if it ain't about some real estate and what I'm drivin
	Get the picture?
	No time to get caught in the mixture
	Plus I was winnin with the 
	LR in a joint venture
	I know you feel that
	Money's the motive nigga
	But I'm coming out of fiscal year with my
	Number seven figures

Chorus:  Well, Goddamn that niggas layin up in ICU
	Shot the fuck up and nobody got a clue
	That's some bullshit for real
	Son was set up and y'all won't say who
	Somebody knows and yo, I think I got a clue

L.:  So niggas what's the deal y'all
	Somebody squeal or Imma fuck around and kill all
	That fall just for frontin
 	Cuz somebody know sumthin
	Yo, Tray, I think it's you
	You never showed love for my brother son
	I should pop that ass now you pretty motherfucker
Tray:  Aight, you right, shit is true, I never really liked that nigga but
	Despite my personal views I'd never snipe the nigga
	Fuck a oozy
	When I'm layin in Jacuzzis
	Sippin on Don P, slayin a don piece
	Chillin, makin movies which reminds me
	Sis in the picture, I used to hit that
	But, correct me if I'm wrong, I coulda sworn I seen you wit that
	Plus, y'all never got along and you accuse me, wait a second yo
	My question is what's wit the leather gloves and why you sweatin?
L.:  What, are you suggestin
	That I put one in my flesh and
	Blood?
Tray:  Coulda been done
Rock:  Yeah, civil of the good son when the good one almost caught it
L.:  Yo, Rock, don't even take it further
	Cuz you was the last nigga wit him
	Huh, did you attempt the murder?
	Y'all was supposed to come together
Rock:  Right, and we was on the way but then son had to make a run
	Hold up dog, what are you sayin?
L.:  That you're to blame, the last to arrive, the rest of us was early
Mr. Lee:  Aight so just what time did you get here
L.:  What, about 7, 7:30?
Mr. Lee:  Fuck that you left for a second nigga
L.:  Nigga you know what, niggas is funny
	Rock, that nigga drank your liquor
	Mr. Lee, he owes you money
	But y'all look at me like I'm guilty
	I find that hard believin 
	When my case and point is I'm the only one without a reason  

Chorus

L.:  Check it out, we all agree that he was the nicest MC
All:  True dat, for real, aight
Mr. Lee:  But, L., you looked at him wit envy
L.:  Yo that's my brother, not me
	I beg to differ
Mr. Lee:  Aight then let's get back to this picture
L.:  Yo what about it
Mr. Lee:  Niggas know you used to dig her
L.:  She got a fat ass but I doubt it
Tray:  Oh yeah she got a fat ass
Mr. Lee:  You, hold up Tray, he's killin me
	L. used to hit it be	
	Before he went away to DC
	That's right, remember that?
	So all this doubt shit, yo I ain't feelin that
	And it got you heated when you found out LR was killin that
L.:  Yo you still on that?
Mr. Lee:  Yeah I'm still on that and I would let it pass
	But you the only nigga wit gloves and a mask, dumb ass!
	Blood splashed from sole to sole
	Now you lookin petro
	Caught you plottin from the get-go
	But son ain't dead, though
L.:  Goddammit I knew it this . 38 special is bullshit and played
	Next time I'm blazin niggas wit the 12 gauge
	I had it made, was on my way to LA 
	To lay low, nigga 
	And stay to' 
	Up off the Hennesy
	Fuck memories, yo we was enemies
	And shit you didn't see, since we was young yo son was testin me
	I let it get the best of me
Tray:  It's jealousy!
L.:  Yeah, yeah whateva B.
	Yo, I admit that
	I used to love her and I smacked it
	But I'll be damned if Imma let that nigga crack it

ByStorm business. 

Tell yo honey to go and listen. 

I need for you and the Reepz to put a hit 

out on the industry. 

You know my fee. Wit a ten percent bonus

Phone: Ay, yo Tray listen. I gotta bounce, listen Tray. 

I gotta bounce, my phone might be tapped, 

you know my code, get back to me wit an

Tray Lee: Word up, this serious business right here. 

Glad y'all could make it. 



[Voices of approval from the Reepz] 



Verse One: 



TL:My niggaz, check this shit out, I just got off the phone 

wit Goose, he want the crew to put a hit out. 



Reepz:On who? 



TL:The industry and yo, it sounds legit, equipped, wit 

infra-red and twenty mil to split. But first we need 

a game plan that fits, ski masks, Tecs nigga wit 

unlimited clips. Bulletproof vests, no let ups, lets 

rock son undebted, so boys I'll be the decoy, the 

first one to set it. 



Reepz 1:Since Tray's the first one to set it, he can 

walk past the guards unprotected, set up 

shop, for the rest of us to wreck shit. 

Meanwhile, I'll lace the basement with 

basement placement of explosives. I see 

four guards where the entourage started, 

just pinpoint the target, so we can get 

started. 



Reepz 2:Yo nigga, I'm all for it, map it, we can score 

it, I need three guns, and a soldier to stand 

by the door wit. No bullshit, I loaded up my 

lyrics and two shotties in the barn from pop 

taped to my body. I'm bustin' shots like it 

don't make sense, gettin' rid of all witnesses 

and evidence. 



Reepz 3:I'm bout to shut it down, I need a round and a 

card, change of gear, arsenal status, the Ramada. 

Forties, fakes, takin' up space, reals get nada. 

Time to make it sicker than Italian Jim Carter. 



TL:No doubt, I see we on the same page, shit is proper, 

so the operation starts in eighteen hundred hours.

bosses. While I got this guys occupied, Borne,

The four RNF files and shit like that, and take, 

anything that says they got us under contract. 

Since niggas are wired, this how it go, when you 

hear me make a move to leave the room, then 

that's the signal. 



R1:Now that we have the instructions, and the 

blueprints have been structured, it's time to do it. 

AV, chick, you set bombs, to defuse it, if they 

got confused wit, the plan just use it. Take no 

prisoners, give no remorse. Tray Lee kissed his 

cross and was off.

evening. 



Businessmen of the Industry:This better be good.

that we can combine all our entities, and make 

one big music conglomerate. 



BOTI:What?! What the hell are you talkin' about?!

Verse One: Tracey Lee

Hey this is how we get down with no question
Trees in the V.I.P. section, Big Sun sippin on French Connections
Dashin, decked in the latest fashions
Flashin, niggaz spendin tax free cash, ten G stash
Son leavin the club scene smashed, hah
Ass in abundance, run with a sick type
click with mics get in your shit life
so better make sure your shit's tight
When I bomb, shit is worldwide like dot.com
Known to rock swarms, get up in that ass like
Dong Strongarm in the place at alarming rates
Got a fifth and that's all it takes

Try to front on and get your fronts chipped
Runnin chicks home in plush whips, get a duck sick
Let it be known we got a song that don't quit

You know we get down, you know we get down

Verse Two: Tracey Lee

Yeah this is how we get down with no question
Run up in a chicken's midsection, boom I rock on
from marathons to quick sessions
Menage-a-trois, killin your whole crew
with at least sixteen bars like MC's supposed to
A real MC, take you, to School like D
I'm cool like G, in Rap, I use the mic, to rule like a Pharaoh
Dipped in my Nike apparel, you know we get down
Bad to the bone like marrow chicks
Crack your boom, Tray gets played from the plat the greatest tune
Philly's in here, been here, lyrics they win here
Why did you go there?  I swear

We breakin your team up like a salary cap, and it don't stop
until I get the cream like Shaq
Seventeen mil annual, flammable

And every hoe that my crew know
        Like Tasha, Yvette, or Sha-See

Verse Three: Tracey Lee

So with no question, hey, lyrics get etched in
stone destined to be, y'all niggaz Jonesin
A threat when, in the zone get protection
duke the best in, my profession
When I ride loops like a stretch Benz, heads get laced
D-Dot keep the chrome cocked, just in case
Tracey Lee rocks son I'm chosen
Whenever we got this party scene live it's frozen
Whoaaa, time to close in on those who be dozen
Not tryin to hear it, without wine and spirit
Shows continue to blow the venue
With flows that's sicked than influ-enza
Roll with a squad that injures pretenders
I'm pullin your card, so surrender
Bombard your agenda, at last RNF stash
with more pitch slaughterin, so we be the new world order in

Tracey MacLean,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me [Live],2007
Tracey MacLean,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap [Live],2007
Tracey Thorn,"Don't waste my time now
Don't call me baby when you don't know if you love me
If you're coming or going
 
And don't leave the back door open
And look for a way out and then say maybe 
You love me but there's no way of knowing
 
Why does the wind blow through my house at night?
Why does the wind blow through my heart each time I look into your eyes?
 
Don't look for reasons
Don't tear your heart wondering why the light starts fading 
When the day the is ending
Embrace the seasons and get to believing 
That its only something broken that seems worthwhile mending
 
Why does the wind blow through my house at night?
Why does the wind blow through my heart 
Each time I look into your eyes?
 
Your heart is sore like mine was before
You look to the sky and no one cares why
Not even the wind so where to begin
 
And since we exist
And why not just
Why not just
And why not just kiss?",Why Does The Wind,

Tracey Thorn,"How you supposed to tell when it's true 
And when you're only fooling yourself
Saying over and over 
That it's still enough
Finding only bitterness when once was loved

Ooh, what do you supposed to do?
When the truth explodes and knocks you down
Close your eyes and count to ten
When you wait once more
Reappears a perfect day that was once before

How can you carry on this way?
When each time you're near you, turn your head away

Well, I'm losing count 
But I guess that you're still winning
How can you be so rational 
When my head is spinning

Why did I let you get to me
Why couldn't I have stayed the girl I used to be
And you must hate the way I don't see things like you do
So get angry, prove your point, I'll believe you
You're maddening but you keep me awake

But how can you when you weren't even there?

Sudden things rearrange, and this whole world seems like a new place

Like a fox that prays on a rabbit
Had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and habits
Oh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up and I was in your arms and I knew that I was captured

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Any time the hunter gets captured by the game

I had to lay such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it

Tracey Thorn,"Meetings arranged, they say, never work out
I say we’ve proved them wrong without a doubt
I can’t remember now just what we said
I never could have guessed what lay ahead
As I ran towards you up the stairs
Did a voice in my ear cry “Beware”?

Even now I’m surprised you recall
Such a short time it took me to fall
Pretending that my heart still lay elsewhere
When in truth I had long ceased to care
For what I thought I’d never replace
‘Til in my heart you left him no space

You say, you wonder what was it I saw?
I say “Oh, I don’t recall anymore”
My first impressions have been left behind
Replaced now by feelings and more lost in kind
Sure that you know but you never can tell
When I think I understand you so well
Shakes me that you were a constant surprise

Tracey Thorn,"Empty hours  Spent combing the street  In daytime showers  They've become my beat;  As I walk from cafe to bar  I wish I knew where you are;  Because you've clouded my mind  And now I'm all out of time  Empty skies say try to forget  Better advice is to have no regrets;  As I tread the boulevard floor  Will I see once more;  Because you've clouded my mind  'Till then I'm biding my time    I'm only sad in a natural way  And I enjoy sometimes feeling this way  The gift you gave is desire  The match that started my fire    Empty nights with nothing to do  I sit and think, every thought is for you;  I get so restless and bored  So I go out once more;  I hate to feel so confined  I feel like I'm wasting my time",The Paris Match,2003
Tracey Thorn,"Some things never seem to change
Kids still call each other names
Should get better, but it's sad and strange
Every insult still the same

Growing up in small town hell
They bide their time till the dinner bell
Take a swing with a bag, and they wait
By the school gate

All this pushin' and shovin'
When you need a little lovin'
A little human kindness
But where you gonna find it?

So you close your bedroom door
And you kneel down on the floor
Cause you don't want to get caught
Packing the bag that your mother doesn't even 
Know you bought

""So it's come to this"" you cry
Not even time to say goodbye
You pack some cigarettes and an A-Z
Push the suitcase back under the bed

You've been balanced on a knife
Will the city save your life?
You've been waiting for so long
Just for somewhere to feel like home

You've been balanced on a knife
Will the city save your life?

Tracey Thorn,"Do you ever wonder
Where love goes?
Up there in the ether I suppose
Sometimes it burns enough to leave a trace in the air
The ghost of me and you in a parallel world somewhere

Do you ever think about that walk to the station
And how it all ended then there
As every door has opened then we vanished in the air
Into a parallel world somewhere
I know you've wondered and I wonder as well
I'm not a secret that you've kept
My heart broke just there once
I know the place it fell
By Piccadilly Station I sat down and wept

Does anyone witness such a disappearance?

The air just seems to shiver and you're never seen again

Falls across the street
I watch the way you blink 
Just before you speak

We haven't even started anyway
Sometimes love is a mistake
An easy one to make
And if there's any doubt
You're better off without
I watch as you sit 

Staring at your screen
I think that I could fit 
This places in between
It's easy when we try
We need reminding why
We try, when we try
Do we just intend to try?
And that's broken and sad
Still the only thing we have
And I'll be waiting here
'til someone has a better idea
Something that could make it easy",Easy,2007
Tracey Thorn,"Woke up this morning to the smell of rain
Tears running down your window pane
Little pictures on your telephone
To remind you that you're not alone
Through the curtains see the breaking sun
Let you know you're not the only one

With your eyes closed
You can count the fingers on one hand
You've been sleeping with the wrong man
Couldn't see through the thick fog
And now you're falling off a log

Looked at your diamond it was just a fake
Your heart was sleeping now it's wide awake
And all your girlfriends in the living room
Sit and tell you it was never you
Trailing scoubidous and pokemon
Taxi's here now so come on, come on

Let's get out there
No looking back, it's just history
You've been barking up the wrong tree
Now just follow your own nose

Boy, you've been on the wrong road
Wearing someone else's shoes

And like it was just understood

Now I need that feeling
I'm reaching for that feeling
Hands up to the ceiling

And the rain came down on a cold, gray town
And I showed myself to them

Sometimes you almost can
Touch it with your fingers
And hold it in your hands

It falls on you like rain
But you close your hands on air
And there it goes again

Your mother's blue
And your father too
It's in the family
So where does that leave you?

Your eyes are open
Your hands are bruised
Your wings are broken
So what is there to lose?

And the sun coming through the trees
Is much prettier than

And the sun coming through the rain
Is more precious than gold

Really someone should give me a uniform
Or someone should show me where is the door
Or someone should come around and explain
How it is that love forgets to speak its name

And then you turn on the news
And it's somebody else's news
And it's always such bad news
And I'm no good with sad news anymore

Late in the afternoon, a little older

Please, don't begin to doubt me

For something to kick away this crutch

I'm not a mystery

I stand here every night
In fluorescent bathroom light

'Cause you broke my heart in 17 places
Shepherds Bush was only one

There's no point in us making any more dates
Why don't you play football with some of your mates?
If I stay in London I'll just want to cry
So I'm leaving baby, this is my final goodbye
(this is my final goodbye)

Now I'm going away to be on my own
And I will forget all the things that you've done

Tracey Ullman,"You've been around for such a long time now
Oh
Maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely ev'ry night
When I can be with you
Oh yes
You make it right
And I don't listen to the guys who say that you're bad for me
And I should turn you away 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
I get a feeling when I look at you wherever you go now I want to be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care

And if they keep on talking
Still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you and you hold my hand 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve?
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose
Baby
There's no need for living in the past

Now I've found good loving gonna make it last
I tell the others
Don't bother me
'Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

No
I don't listen to their wasted lines

Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

Traci Lords,"I remember that day, 'cause I was excited. 
No school. I'd been raking my father's field, 
wearing this stupid little dress. 
Rocking out, raking it up. 

Sort of sweating, feeling good. 
I was laying on the grass. Making big angels. 
I was feeling kinda itchy, in the grass, 
laying in the sun, mmm, kinda liking the way it felt. 
Guess I must have fallen asleep. 

I still don't know what woke me up. 
All I can remember seeing were these huge eyes, 
staring over me. Right on top of me. 
This older boy, out of my league, 
'Cause I was no cheerleader, no lipstick queen. 
I could feel his eyelashes on my face 
And they were tickling me. 
Maybe that's what woke me up. 
I was shocked. That sun was so hot, and he was so warm. 
I didn't know what it was but it felt kinda good. 
Just the way his fingers ran through my hair, 
Just raking it up. I'd never had anyone touch me 
Like that before cept for my mother. 
I knew there was something wrong, but I don't know, 
I kinda liked it. It was sort of like, wow. 
Like amazing. 

And he just kept whispering 
""You're sooooooo beautiful., god, you're beautiful"" 
Just this sweet voice tickling me. 

Then I got kinda nervous. 
And I got really embarrassed. 
I felt myself getting really hot. 
Sort of blushing, that hot. 
I tried to get up, but he started to laugh, 
And he started pulling me down, pinning me to the ground. 
He's not playing a game. I hear this screaming, and it's me. 
And I started to hear my clothes rip. 

And I got scared, really scared. 
And in a way, I hoped to God no one would find us, 
'Cause I was so embarrassed. 
I became silent. This is all wrong. 

It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. 

His hand over my mouth. 
That's why I'm not screaming. 

I didn't say anything. 
I didn't feel anything. 
I just drifted away. 
I just floated. 
Just that sharp pain. 
And then he's through with me. 
I didn't tell anyone. 
Didn't tell anyone.",Father's Field,1995
Traci Lords,"You're sunshine, coursing through my veins
Like acid, digging its own lane
You consume me
I don't even fight

Oh, I feel intoxicated
Stumbling, drunk, yeah I'm so in love
Times swayed it
But beware I bite

I feel sublime, then I lose ground
Tripping on words that have no sound of love
I climb higher and I lose my grip

And the world will be as one",Imagine,1988

To make our love remain
I'm lookin' for a sweeter love

Sugar and spice, everything nice
Squash is defied, make up your mind
To find what the chef's been cookin'

It's got to be a sweeter type of thing
I'll tell you boy exactly what I need-I need

Two scoops of sugar? What is the meaning?
What is the theory behind it that puts a girl and a boy in effect?

Turn up the oven and pump up the juice
Like a fire, sparks fly loose-like a criminal steals the diamnds he gives to her
But she'd rather have sugar!

We were planning our lives

Wonderin' why
How could you leave
Without sayin' goodbye
Picture you smile
Inside my head
Still smell your cologne
All over my bed

I pray every night
That the angels
Are watchin' you
& trainin' you right

So nobody hears
There's just no escape
In the sound of my tears
Miss you so much
& every night
I can't sleep
It ain't right
Memories keep holdin' me down
They're just no fun
When you're not around
Don't know what to do

Than to bury that jewel when it was mine all along

Tracy & Nathan Thomas,"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing
Send her back home

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say, ""Cuckoo""
Regretfully they tell us but firmly they compel us
To say goodbye to you

So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye, goodbye

I'm glad to go, I cannot tell a lie

Tracy Alison Walsh,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips


And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more
