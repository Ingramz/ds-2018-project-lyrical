Tony Orlando & Dawn,"Hey girl what ya doin' down there
Dancin' alone every night while I live right above you
I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me you don't even know me
I love you
Oh my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show
If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note that's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
Only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart
Oh my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show
I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me you don't even know me
I love you
Oh my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show",Knock Three Times,1999
Tony Orlando & Dawn,"What good is that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry

It looks like another fall
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all
When you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man

It does you no good to pretend child
You've made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like you lose again, my friend
Call on your rainy day man

Now rainy day man he don't like sunshine
He don't chase rainbows
He don't need good times
Grey days rolling
Then you'll see him
Empty feeling
Now you need him

All those noble thoughts they just don't belong
You can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just look up your rainy day man

Now simple pleasures they all evade you
Store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain
Ask again
Go on and pray for rain

It looks like another fall
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all
When you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man
All I need to do is look up my rainy day man

Now what good is that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry",Rainy Day Man,1999
Tony Orlando & Dawn,"Oh, the good life, full of fun, 
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life let's you hide 
All the sadness you feel.

You won't really fall in love, 
For you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself, 
Don't try to fake romance.

It's the good life 
To be free and explore the unknown,
Like the heartaches 
When you learn you must face them alone.

Please remember, I still love you, 
And in case you don't know,
Well, just wake up, 
Kiss the good life ""hel-lo"".",The Good Life,2005
Tony Orlando & Dawn,"Oh no,

If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me, if you still want me

Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

Bus driver, please look for me
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison and my love, she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
And I wrote and told her please

Tony Ortega,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1959
Tony Ortega,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1959

Tony Osborne,"Sunset glow fades in the west, 
Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

But now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.",Now Is the Hour,1997

I'll ever adore,
So forgive me, do,
If I say to you
What I've said so often before.

I love you, Samantha,
And my love will never die.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Together, Samantha,
We could ride a star and ride it high.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
And if some distant day
You decided to say,
""Get along, go away, goodbye!""
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one gal guy.","I Love You, Samantha",2002
Tony Osborne,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2002
Tony Osborne,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002
Tony Osborne,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for

Tony Osborne,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme

Tony Osborne,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart

Gayer than laughter am I

Am I with you",Younger Than Springtime,2002
Tony Osborne,"Sisters, sisters
There were never such devoted sisters
Never had to have a chaperon, no sir
I'm here to keep my eye on her
Caring, sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing
When a certain gentleman arrives from Rome
She wore the dress and i stayed home
All kinds of weather
We stick together
The same in the rain or sun
Two different faces
But in tight places
We think and we act as one... uh-huh
Those who've seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up but no one can

Stay on the streets of this town 
And they'll be carving you up alright 
They say you gotta stay hungry 
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight 
I'm dying for some action 
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book 
I need a love reaction 
Come on now baby gimme just one look

The light of hope in their eyes

And though I'm far away
I still can hear them say
Bombs up...
But when the dawn comes up

there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see

there'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow
When the world is free

The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again

there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see

there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow
Just you wait and see...",The White Cliffs of Dover,2007
Tony Overwater,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Tony Pastor,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

Chorus:
Everything else can stay till later
Right now we ah deal with the Creator

Because ah God ah the man who have the plan
Whe the whole world have fi go call upon
Mi bawl out God ah the man wha have the plan
Him have the big wide world inna him hand

Omnipotent omnipresent omniscient character
The I am that I am Alpha and Omega
The ever-living ever-truthful faithful forever
And it seems like most people can't remember
Unti I them find themself inna big disaster
Like hurricane and fire earthquake and tremor
Dem deh time dem deh dem knee down inna sincere prayer
But you can't use Jah when you want a favor
You haffi love him every second every minute every hour

Chorus

You know the big man them weh claim say that them rule

Whe the whole world have fi go call upon
Mi bawl out God ah the man wha have the plan

Shut and unlock the gate
Make we praise Him before its too late
All we gotta do is have some faith
Exercise patience and wait
One more time from the scripture line

Chorus

Him ah the ruler of all ruler
Him an the kings of all kings
Him ah the morning and evening
Ending and the beginning
He's the one that take care
And the one you should fear

Jah Jah made us because him have an excellent plan
Created us in his image and oh just so we tan
Say him no want us to represent no other man

So

Chorus

The one who give life the one who always a blow breath
The one who alone have the power to destroy them
The one who mek we prophesy and mek it fulfill
Authorize Joshua ti mek the son stand still
Me check the magnitude and all his mysteries
Cannot find words to describe how great he is
All we got to do is give thanks and praises
And spread love like breeze going through the branches
Because ah God ah the man who have the plan
Whe the whole world have fi go call upon
Mi bawl out God an the man wha have the plan
Him have the big wide world inna him hand

",Creator,1993
Tony Rebel,"(Featuring Garnet Silk)
-P. Barrett-

Garnet is long time we have something
To tell the world you know

So it was in the beginning
And a so it is straight unto the end
Nothing is new under the sun
So it was written
So it must be done seen
Ethiopian sons
Step up Jah sons

Garnet Silk's Verse:
We made a vow we promised
We're gonna keep it
We don't need your consent
We're God's instrument
I'm sure that we're fight
So we devoted our lives
To tell the world of the things we see
And what is to be

Watch me now now
From we a youth we no stop seek the truth
Inna Jah army we get recruit
No must a rebel that
And me nah tell no lie, we no stop try
Be the good sons of the most high
'Cause every man get a vision and have a mission
But not everyone going make the tradition
Some living illusion through position and possession
That cause division and bad decision
Stand haffi lake and we must draw the line
Remember who you are don't forget 'bout time
As you wake you feel the vibes
And as you sleep you see the signs
So make we go on spread the message to all mankind

Ai, yai, yai, yai, yai
Make a joyful noise unto Jah
Again Ethiopian sons

Garnet Silk's Verse

That decorated scene weh no stop attractive
No stop invitation fi come over come live
But through we mind done make up and we well positive
We just a do weh we have to do and don't get discourage
Because we mind a we thoughts and we works a we heart
Is prepare 'cause we swear and we already start
Are you really ready for this some people might ask
But with the powers of Jah we can deal with the task
Ai, yai, yai, yai, yai
From we a youth we no stop seek the truth
Inna Jah army we get recruit
No must a Rebel that
And me nah tell no lie, we no stop try
Be the good sons of the most high
No must a Rebel that
We expect the unexpected and we know we get a fight
But we know how it go when you start see Jah light
But we going to continue to do what is right
Feed the people with the words who have the appetite
I hear voices of people saying that we are strange
But we still nah change, nah rearrange
We shall be happy for the promise we keep
'Cause we know a weh you sow man, that you gwine reap
Ai, yai, yai, yai, yai
We won't change, won't rearrange
We'll find a way to break the chains again



",Ethiopian Sons,1993
Tony Rebel,"-P. Barrett-

Long time me give unu warning
Seems like unu still not listening
Original guerilla Tony Rebel always a tell them say

Chorus:
A fresh D.J. is coming and heading for a number one
A fresh D.J. is coming and out to be a champion
But down in a the music man it red
An man it dread man it red
But down in a the music how it red how it red how it red
But down in a the music man it dread man it red man it red
But down in a the music how it dread
How it dread how it dread

Come now, people it's obvious
That Tony Rebel him is talented
I'm going to tell you how it was initiated
Dung inna di ghetto that was where I man originated
To be a good entertainer that was what I always wanted
So I want to reach the top and so I decided
To be more efficient and be more dedicated
I went amongst nuff entertainer and was disrespected
'Cause I didn't wear fancy chain and look sophisticated
De way dem a deal wid me
Them wanted me to get enervated
Till de most high God him come, I man was uplifted
Him say, hey Tony Rebel can't you see that you are gifted
So some a them a hypocrite
And nuff a dem they are confounded
But you got to live together with them
You cannot be separated
Inna de music business I am loved Jah know I am hated
Fling a whole heap of style and I man is appreciated

Chorus

Vibes is a thing you know it just can't be injected
Got to be with you from the moment that you was created
That's why towards drugs whole heap of entertainer
They're addicted
Cannot perform very well unless they're well intoxicated

Now they fling a whole heap a style
And it cannot be comprehended
Fling a whole heap of style and it kind of complicated
That's why inna de music business
Many people are not interested
It is obvious that this music it was invaded
We got to come again now and have it diverted
'Cause that is the only way we know that we can be elevated
Give the people them a surprise
And what they did not expected
Now to do all this you know that time has got to be invested
That is the only way we know we can be elevated
These are some speech that is highly selected

Chorus



",Fresh D.J.,1993
Tony Rebel,"-P. Barrett-

One of the greatest four letter words
My eyes have behold and my ears ever heard
I say every other thing come second and third
Love a the power, watch this

Chorus:
I say unnu love one another
I telling unnu to love one another,
I want you love one another
Love one another, love one another
Come again come love one another, I say love one another

Remember love one another, love one another,
Love one another
Because love could make you happy
Coulda never make you sad
Trying to make it snappy
And get that love that you must have
Because L and a 0 and a V and a E
That could make the world f-are-e-e
L and a 0 and a V and a E
That good for you and that good for
Man and woman in a relationship
You don't have love it cannot exist
So I insist that you refuse to resist
That wonderful thing that your heart must cherish
Because from my experience the greatest ingredients
Is love and obedience connected with reverence
I always admire a loving desire
That's what we require so kindle the fire

Chorus

All the people living inna this world today
Shoulda never ever let love get away
'Cause L-0-V-E can make you okay
Every second every minute every hour of the day
So if Europe and America Caribbean and Asia
And Japan and China and Mama Africa
Could just come together this wood would be better
'Cause love is the power spread it all over
Chorus
One of the greatest four letter word
My eyes have ever behold and my ears ever heard
'Cause like and lust and crush come third
You take me up on that you have a nerve
Because I'm optimistic and enthusiastic
And very prophetic about this topic
I have to spread it make it get endemic
Till an epidemic in all family units

",Love One Another,1993
Tony Rebel,"-P. Barrett-

Mi tired fi every evening me go home
Me girl a tell me the same thing over and over again
Bwoy, she just keep repeating every time
The girl always a say. Hear weh she say

I am saying,
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back
Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I am appointed by Jah
To go everywhere and preach
People of this world
Request that I speak
I am present in the studio
Seven nights of the week
And working hard to make two ends meet
So erase all the negative thoughts from your mind
Don't judge me by the past 'cause I am right this time
'Cause although for a week I am not in your sight
You should not be saying awful things like
Oh stop delaying
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I have not lied
God knows I have tried
To reach your heart but that has been denied
So I am asking you to observe each side
And please let your conscience be your guide
I know that maybe you are not in one of the best mood
But that should not dictate your attitude
The wrong decision could be devastating
'Cause in the long run you will be sorry that you sing

I am not playing
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me can't believe a you say so
Nothing couldn't go so
Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I know what I must do for the people of this world
Every woman every man and every boy and girl
You should be giving me strength so that I go along
Instead of making this false accusation
It's kind of shocking but I am still watching
If you will be changing that old saying
You know what I am thinking is that you are not willing
To do some listening you keep repeating

I am not playing
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

Me no do you nothing
How you want me leggo
(repeat)

I always believe that you could understand
'Cause we had some much of these conversations
If I went out with another woman
That would be giving justification
You speech is causing embarrassment
And I am sure this time that I am innocent
Since you insist you get your heart content
But make sure you can stand the consequence

I am still saying
It's my way or the highway
You should be going
You made your choice and now you know what's coming
Pack your things and don't come back no more no more
Don't come back

It's not surprising I'm recognizing
The power at the music and a how it is a moving

But them always a say, reggae nah reach no weh
And me tell them weh no dead no dash it weh

Chorus

I used to wonder and used to ponder
If this yah music could really take over
The question answer that a come off me shoulder
And the earth the music at the four comer
So we better start show better interest
'Cause every company them no stop invest
Still lord nevertheless
We haffi acknowledge the gold mine that we possess

Chorus

Mi know some uptownist weh no love the music
Find say them pickney tun music addict
Every day them carry the youth them gone a psychiatrist

Ever listen reggae music from six till six

But you must remember, good is over evil

Chorus

'Cause struggle it no new, long time it a go on
Long, long, long, long, long, long before I born

Success is always governed by law
So if you want progress without problems
Just look for the laws and try apply them

Chorus

Nuff want go to heaven yet no want die
Them no want grow feather, yet them want fly

",Success,1993
Tony Rebel,"-P Barrett-D. Colins - T.T. Hall-

Original guerilla Tony Rebel ah talk
And you know me always a talk from mi heart
You shoulda know that man

Chorus:
There's a vibes about the time
And it's real and I can feel it every day
How they choose to refuse the good news
And then lose and go astray
But I see clear and I can hear of all the fear
That is now plaguing all mankind
Is only Jah can really help us inna this ya revelation time
Lend me oonuh ears nuh
Full time you listen
Exercise righteousness and make we get God blessing

The war fi stop now
Whether jungle or garden
If a problem occur
Make we sit down and reason
If you a shower you can go pray every hour
Unite with Spanglers and make we fight for Black Power
If you nub do that you know say
Dog nyam yuh supper
Look inna yourself and elevate from the gutter

Chorus

Everyone ah feel it
Not only you, she or him
'Cause this is not regional
It's a global thing
And most things whe you see ah the consequence of sin
But it's good to know that everything is everything
The signs of the time should not make you panic
In the Bible every line show that it is prophetic
All things must take place before thy Kingdom come
So it was written, so it must be done

Chorus

Who nuh see clear haf fi hear
This yah vibes whe we a share
And who aware be prepare 'cause the end is near
Have no fear if Jah a steer
Just relax inna yuh chair
And he is here and he is there
And ready to take care
Chorus
Lord people always wrong yes and nuh want take the blame
Nuff a play hypocrite just fe get good name
Man behavior against mankind bring sorrow and pain
But it's good to know that God love us the same
When me check the diseases and the catastrophes
Whe broke out like wild fire in all the countries
We shouldn't be fighting our brothers with our energies
'Cause them de kind of thing is our worst enemies

When Israel was in Egypt's land
Suffering, suffering, suffering
Oppressed so hard they could not stand
The more things change a the more they remain the same
Suffering, suffering, suffering
And God said, go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's tend
We say pharaoh but you know them name

Tell old pharaoh, this is just a lyrical game
Let my people go
Big up all South African freedom fighters

Because a me philosophy, them would a kill me
Look how me right and yet them wrong me
And if them have the power
Then me know them woulda hang me
But that nah stop me from talk reality

Chorus:
'Cause I will be the voice, I will be the pen
I will be the Moses weh come back again
And if it cost me me wealth, cost me me fame
I will wear the next X behind my name

'Cause big speech mouth sweet big promises a make
And all now mi no see weh poor people a get
A pure blood and tears and whole heap of sweat
And that cause sufferation and a whole heap of death
How could you be sifting there, telling me that you care
Promise people good things and by the Bible you swear
Now is the time to make you speech
Because the right time come
An you a go on like you dumb or them cut out you tongue
Me haffi talk even if you brand me
You look how me right and yet you want wrong me
And if them have the power
Then me know them woulda hang me
But that nah stop me from talk reality
I will be the voice, I will be the pen
I will be the Moses weh come back again
And if it cost me me wealth, cost me me fame
I will wear the next X behind my name

Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old pharaoh
Let my people go
Gwann go do it, by any means necessary

Equality and justice free from prejudice
True love from above, a that we fi practice
It kind of hard but we still optimistic
Help the children of Israel, right out of Egypt
This task is very
Extraordinary
But we haffi use any means necessary

Long time we a hush a full time we speak up
'Cause f-are-e-e-d-o-m is a must

Chorus

A put me life on the line for things me believe in
Knowing the truth cause offense but me know a no sin
Confident in the victory over evil will win
So people smile and stop the crying
Them try to destroy every prophet that Massa God send
But God is so good that him send more again
With diplomatic attitude and strategic trend
Come fi help another Daniel out of the lion den
A me philosophy, them woulda kill

A put the captive case in front of the Almighty God
An him say, Son don't run, you cannot be coward
Moses was protected because him have a rod
Now we use a chapter a day run the devil away method

Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old pharaoh
Let my people go
Because a me philosophy, them would a kill me
Look how me right and yet them wrong me
And if them have the power
Then me know them woulda hang me
But that nah stop me from talk reality

Chorus

This is a warning to all pharaoh
All false leader, all the downpressor
Them have the whole world under severe pressure
And them don't love people, them only love more power
But your days are numbered, Massa God nah sleep
And if you follow we through the red sea
Then you must get defeat
You have strength for the coward, and you frighten the weak
But a God give we the word and we must have to speak

Go down Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old pharaoh
Let my people go
Warning, warning, warning
Tell you this morning, I tell this evening
Take warning
Let my people go, my people go

Tony Rice,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air
Share in a memory of gray
And wander in my words
And dream about the pictures that I play of changes

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
But then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade of changes

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
And when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn of changes

Passions will part to the [Incomprehensible] melody
As fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls of changes

Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else
One last drop of wine we will pour
I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shore of changes

Sit by my side, come as close as the air
Share in a memory of gray
And wander in my words
And dream about the pictures that I play of changes

",Changes,1988
Tony Rice,"John Wilkes Booth was a southern man,
Born of an actor in Maryland,
Bound for fortune on a gas-lit stage,
Bound to die at a tender age. 

Washington to Baltimore,
He played the bills and he slept with whores,
And he burned inside with a hatred deep
For the man who caused the south to weep. 

Young Abe Lincoln wasn't young no more,
Tired old man when he won the war,
And he dreamed at night of his death by 

And he saw his body in a ghastly dream,
Draped in black while his widow screamed.
Two silver dollars on his eyelids lay.
Abraham Lincoln has died today. 

CHORUS: They said there were five and they said there were ten.
Some say there was never more than just one man.
Oh, it's awful to see Mr. Lincoln dead
In the name of God and Dixie,
In the name of God and Dixie Land. 

John Wilkes Booth and his band of men
They'd failed before but would try again.
When Good Friday dawned with a fickle sun,
Then Booth declared the day had come. 

The word was passed and the guns were brought,
Down to Mary Sarrat's boarding house.
Sealed in a note, Booth named just four,
But the gallows would sway with many more. 

CHORUS 

John Wilkes Booth went to his grave
With a bullet in his neck and a broken leg,
A patriot and his fantasy
Of redemption, grace, and bravery. 

And those who hanged and those who spent
Their lives behind a jailer's fence,
Only Booth could have set them free
From the taint of the conspiracy.

",John Wilkes Booth,1988
Tony Rice,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,1990

Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart

 

There's bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a traveling through the land

As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame 
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name 

Many a little raindrops are falling close to me 
Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be 
It's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
As the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

How I wish that I could see my little darling 
And hold her in my arms just as before 
I used to tell her every day I loved her 
But now she doesn't love me anymore 

She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime 
And said that she'd be waiting there for me 
But she has found somewhere else to wander 
Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning 
And I am just as weary as can be 
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops 
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea 

But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty 
So I will have to suffer all the shame 
Go and tell her for me little raindrops 
That they've given me a number for my name

Tony Rice,"It was the year of 1900 that was 80 years ago
Death come'd a howling on the ocean and when death calls you've got to go
Galveston had a sea wall just to keep the water down
But a high tide from the ocean blew the water all over the town.

Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning
Wasn't that a mighty storm
It blew all the people away.

The sea began to rolling the ships they could not land
I heard a captain crying Oh God save a drowning man
The rain it was a falling and the thunder began to roll
The lightning flashed like Hell-fire and the wind began to blow

The trees fell on the island and the houses gave away
Some they strived and drownded others died every way.

The trains at the station were loaded with the people all leaving town
But the trestle gave way with the water and the trains they went on down
Old death the cruel master when the winds began to blow
Rode in on a team of horses and cried death won't you let me go.

The flood it took my mother it took my brother too
I thought I heard my father cry as I watched my mother go
Old death your hands are clammy when you've got them on my knee
You come and took my mother won't you come back after me?

And I wonder where she can be

And I wonder if she ever thinks of me.

I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.

By your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound.

Instead

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closing more everyday
And I'm dyin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say, the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down

I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody know it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah, my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still
The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me
Yeah, Ohh, uhh, whoa, omom
Nobody, nobody, but me
Tomorrow morning I'm hittin' the dusty road
Gonna find you where ever, ever you might go
And I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me

And I'm missin' you

If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

If this world were mine

If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me

And honey, you're my inspiration
I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

And the sky would be blue
As long as you're lovin' me

Tony Rich,"How many times do we fall in love, memories that pay attention
The clock is ticking for everyone, time out for all the nonsense
How many stars in the universe, long beach shores and foreign countries
It's like we change when the planet turns, kiss clouds and make us all be

Free, just let us be
Don't make me cry, just let us fly
We're making our own world

What your thinking your getting now, your the first to take for granted
Freedom is loving a different phase, watch out it's happening again
Did you feel like you owe me now, everything that I did not do
Follow me if you can't do, this is the time we become

Free, just let us be
Don't make me cry, just let us fly
We're making our own world

Undo this hold on my breast, time just won't let it fade away
These great thoughts will manifest, thinking life over now
Kiss clouds and make us all be

Tony Scott,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1956
Tony Scott,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Tony Scott,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2005

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007
Tony Scott,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see.

It will be a home for me.

Made of clay and wood

To read or write a book so well

That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my

And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day

We still made it to the top

It's mine I Shyne like money that sound like Biggie
Fuck around my town, Boogie Down my city
Come around get pound, to the ground no pity
Watch the sound, fo'-pound twenty round milli'
Get smacked silly, for coming out your mug
I'm known for bouncin' thugs from the Tunnel to the Salsa clubs
Don't matter, put the chrome to your bladder
Splatter your abs, have you pissin in a plastic bag
That's a drag now you abnormal
Don't make me go out to rumble, 
And put some motherfuckin' stabs on you

The Desert or the shottie, whateva you the body
That chose to be the dumb nigga at the party
Too much Bacardi started speakin' dumb
Then you tried to snuff Joe, must have been Puerto Rican rum
That's the hardcore, two years a sophomore
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
So get lost or take one, bones I break them
Pigs are bacon, so get fried if they come

So I was mean but I still had a scheme 
17 years young everything seemed fun 
Still considered a veteran 'cause I feared none 
Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules
But carried heat 'cause he ain't no fool 
Ain't no wrong for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us 'cause we've been down since the
Genesis two hundred horse power to four hundred Pegasus
The messages don't sleep till its over 
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now I'm ice forever
Stomach bustin' out the white carrera 
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
Ay que sera! what can I do but take you to strive
Ay que hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while 
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I win!

Now its not funny 'cause I'm hot and got a pot of money 
Alot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man
I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor 
I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the Cubans 
To provide now it's my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Ain't nothin' change I'm still humble and modest
And I'm always proud to admit I came straight from the projects

Mamma I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma now I'm on the run
Dear ma-mah what have I done?

Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin' to play me
Couldn't hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin' my girl like she was hoein' on tour
And knowin' I'm raw, money tried to play fly
""I said whassup to the bitch; why she couldn't say hi?""
That ain't right! I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles?
I put 'em in his face
I didn't have to disgrace myself, hatin' myself
""Ahora a tu!"" blam blam, brace yo'self
That's the law, the streets are like basketball
But sometimes you shoot, sometimes you pass it off
Can't always take a shot, make one mistake you upstate for what?
Too much hate, time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I ain't tryin' to see 'em
I love a brother doin' triple life but I ain't tryin' to be him
That's why I be on the low, and keep my feet in the row
Cause they're tellin' me as far as felonies
You get life for three in a row
Then whadday'know? Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody, for steppin' on my kicks (stupid)

[Chorus]

I can murder half the world laugh while the other side hate me
But hurt one hair on my mamma head and I'ma, cry like a baby
She my heart and soul; what Jimi Hendrix was to rock'n'roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weakness's, but Punisher keeps it glizz
So don't pull out 'cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is, hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old; 
Bein' charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste, tryin' to figure the shit
Until I finally realized, we're just niggas and spics
That's what they feel, what can I do but just stay real?
Keep somethin' in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause ain't no brothers, runnin' shit in the system
You goin' straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
Fuck you talkin' about? I live here
This is my buildin' nigga, fuck you nigga!
That's my daughter right there playin fuck off me!
Get the fuck off!

[Chorus]

I don't have much time so I'm only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me mamma, I love you and I'm sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable woman, like their mother
God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man, a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul, I love you

Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man""
I said, ""Mama, now I'm on the run
Dear Mama, what have I done?""

I can murder half the world, laugh, while the other side hate me
But hurt one hair on my Mama head and I'ma cry like a baby
She my heart and soul, what Jimi Hendrix was to rock 'n' roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible

Now you know one of my weaknesses but Punisher keeps it glitz
So don't pull out 'cause when I pop, oh, what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is, hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger

Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old, bein' charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
'Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate

How many hours I waste tryin' to figure the shit?
Until I finally realized we're just niggaz and spics
That's what they feel, what can I do but just stay real?
Keep somethin' in the stash in case I gotta make bail

'Cause ain't no brothers, runnin' shit in the system
You goin' straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
Fuck you talkin' about, I live here
This is my buildin' nigga, fuck you nigga
That's my daughter right there playin' fuck off me, get the fuck off

""Mama, I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man""
I said, ""Mama, now I'm on the run
Dear Mama, what have I done?""

I don't have much time, so I'm only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me Mama, I love you and I'm sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable women, like their mother

God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man, a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul, I love you

""Mama, I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man""
I said, ""Mama, now I'm on the run
Dear Mama, what have I done?""

Hey, ma-ma-ma-mma
I just killed a man
Ma-mmaaa, what am I to do?

What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I'ma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene

My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol

This is going out to you, you and you and you

To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and

Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times who will always...
always be my girl

Now that they give it I'm holdin' a pound
And I'm lookin' for some bustas who be actin' like them niggas do dirt
Come to find out they ain't put in no work
An now my feelings is hurt
Cause they decided that they wanted to murk
But I'ma chase 'em to the end of the Earth
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' rider
You can see the pain in my face
Got no problem exchangin' the hate
They got me fightin' a case
And if I blow will I face a fifteen
And I'll probably do it all in the pen
But yo I'm livin' with it
Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride
A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride ha ha ha

It's the murder man mack, I stash in the Lac
I bought my bricks from these dro back stacks
It's the Birdman baby come and holla at me later
Duck ass niggas, we deal with 'em later
First you, go to the mall and you ball like a dog
And we drop the car, then holla at ya boy
Tell them pussy ass niggas, break bread with the boy
Joe, they breakin' bread with the boy
Tell Big Pun nigga, Stunna ride for the boy
Win or lose I ride for my boy

Niggas tell me money talk
But bullshit is walkin' out on four feet

I'll be a nigga till it's said and done
I'm from a section where ya fight till ya die cause ya never run
I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang
Right up the street from where the cops hang
And in my head I hear Pac sang
And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position
The demon has risen from out of prison
Now I'm losin' my religion
That's how I'm feeling when I'm fuckin' with you
Cause I don't fuck with you, now I'm bustin' at you
So fuck you dude

Damn should be illegal how that ass so fat
The way you shake yo shit make me wanna cop back
Is it ya motion causing all this commotion?
Forget niggaz you even got bitches approaching
Who am I? I'm just a kid from the Bronx
If you love hip-hop you might of heard my shit once
Or maybe twice or like thirteen thousand times
I'm sick of it myself I'm loving the shine
Who else could it be but the squad's O.G?
Be laid up Wit chicks that resemble ?
Half black, Japanese n something
Menages, orgies believe me its nothing
The girls want tha facts got to feed 'em the lies
Who else can have you swimming in wealth the blink of an eye?

Haters want me, they love to slut me
Mad because my fat ass stay - living comfy

When record sales get low we back to advancing bricks
Jack-of-all-trades we do that too
The only rapper get the Suge Knight effect when he come through
When pun died, half of y'all cried
The other half wanna See my demise
It was inevitable the sqaud'll reach new heights it's unforgettable
Follow the don is all we kept telling you
Once you down with the squad you can never give up
No need to get ya jewel's back, let them other crews do that

Fuck a club we flood the studio wit broads
Uh, my whole life never been more focused
Joes the don ask Jennifer Lopez
What the hell in the world did they do to provoke this?

Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change
Keep mah ladies lookin' good, when they touch the Range.
Never fuck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained
Never leave wit a chick, if she don't give brain.
We could leave on trip, I got a private plane
I don't fly, but we could park it up and blaze.

Sometimes I envious on peoples that past away
They so synonm, there wings being cast away
I dream so vivid, the scene shakes me fast awake
I keep thinking maybe somethings tryna show me how to master my faith

They say I'm deep and too complex for rap
But yo, I grew to learn there's more to life then cars and gats
So I chose to share the light and write my bars with that
But niggaz scared to grow so they tend to hold you back

They take this shit that they don't understand and call it wack
Tell you that ain't the way it goes son, that's conscience rap
But why'all running in circles working the same old act
And I done reaching at a level, but I'm wrong for that

And I ain't bitching, I'm just tryna let you know where I'm at
I'm getting old, as my son grows, so do my raps
I feel your misery, you living off the next mans life
He just as bad, 'cause he dreams you can strengthen his light

I want to shout out all the two time fellas holding guns for weak thugs
Risking their freedom, for short money and weak love
85 is tryna earn respect from them young boys
Catching temper tantroms, having fits like young boys

Sit and sleep

I have done
I must pay

Like a ship
On the ocean
That has lost

Spend my life in jail

Tony Thomas,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2006
Tony Thomas,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

And, everybody was singin' and everybody was bringin'
Everybody was dancin' and everybody was smokin'
And, everybody was drinkin' and niggas don't be thinkin'

Hey yo, I be the man dangle, handle bilingual
Shit's so hot, it might be the first single
Soft mack sprinklin' salt on my Pringle
Ain't no stoppin' me now, I'm gon' jungle

NI, flippin' shit, freakin' shit
Runnin' shit from channel to channel
I ain't gon' bite off more than I can handle
I got the DVD all in my wall panel

I ain't try to brag, this is on my dick, 'cause they see in a mag
Should of drived a Benz or I should of drived the Jag
Old school nigga, I rock the doo rag
I might fuck around and let my pants sag

One two, I come through wit my families
Big Psych, pit fight, you know the deals
Potted, take a good look at what we started
Retarded, that Brooklyn bullshit we got it

Everybody already know Toca be 'bout it
And me gettin' knocked out the box, kid, I doubt it
It's crowded, up in the club, so I'm ma rub
My pinga against the ninga to show love

Stuck in the cut, as always I come wit the ruck
Tony Touch, Beatnuts, straight fuckin' it up
Now don't sleep home boy, I got it tucked in the gut
Just in 'cause I gotta flex against one of you ducks

Mira drago, Mr. El Cavallo
I send y'all free like Cinque De Mayo
Claro, come on y'all, get wit the vibe
And follow, and pump this cassette in the ride

Aiyo, Nills where's you man wit the Jeckyl and Hyde?
Let's get this jump-off jumpin', flip the record and slide

Everybody was dancin' and everybody was swingin'
And, everybody was singin' and everybody was movin'
And, everybody was movin' to the groove
Everybody was dancin' and everybody was smokin'

And, everybody was drinkin' and niggas don't be thinkin'
Aiyo, Psych is chillin', flippin' the hottest hits in the club drinkin'
Never trickin' on a pigeon, yo who I'm bringin'
The glock is hittin', but it's reachable by hand
I'm ma beat you wit this, 'til you can't understand

And I don't give a fuck if you don't know who I am
This is that pimp song, so take your minks off
And wild out for the night and get your drinks on
Mami, the way you rock me on the dance floor

Got me, ready to take my fuckin' pants off
Blast off into a new dimension
Here's a little somethin' I'd like to mention
If you ain't lovin' it, you must be a hater
If shorty ain't fuckin', see you later

Hasta la vista, you full of pasta and pizza
Oh, you gangster, I'm ma get mobster and beat ya
Now tell me who the best there is
Greg NI, Tony Touch, Psycho Les, there it is

Everybody pit fightin' and, niggas don't be writin'
And, muthafuckas keep bitin' and

Knamsayin, word up (Make it make it a record real quick, do yo' thang)
Throw ya seatbelts on, ahhight? 
(Yeah, hook it up, make it a record, get down yo)

I take why'all niggas straight, +Beneath the Surface+
to the core, if it ain't raw its worthless
Pentab professional, hold the ink
while river rats fall off the raft and sink
Tony let a brother Touch, twenty bar rush
The way we push through equivalent to rocket thrust
Allah just, I lay it for the mix tapes
Quick to quake a label-mate 
The sound came outta rusted crate
Surrounded by cobwebs
Beat smooth enough to slide through like bobsleds
On a cold white snow, plus with the right flow
Wu-Tang niggaz they shine and make the mic glow

Allowed you to put down ya guns, and raise ya pen
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig, we don't fuck with no pig
We teach the kids, you rather have a bullet or a word to your wig
Murder rates increases, bullet holes the size of fifty cent pieces
Don't worry about the weed or pussy, I read books
I'm liable to mate'cha king with three rooks
You see the Wu W raised in black fists
Maybe Tony Touch, Concord needle will scratch this
The ice cube link you bought, from the Jew for 80 G's 
was only appraised at forty-two
Gazed upon by the eyes of multitude
of people, who would trade gold for food
I heard boar's head killed more than nuclear's warhead
Or street serfs who walk around dressed in all red
Bobby Digi said if you ever in Compton or Long Beach
Break my sons Doc Doom and Crisis wit a nice piece

Bloodsport, anymore heads face the blade
Fakers must fade, the stakes are now raised
Words of murder, suspense, and intrigue
Make major league niggaz show signs of fatigue
My Killer Bees span wider than seven seas
Squeeze on MC's, with bullet train speed
Tony's Touch create more gold than Midas

To ever single seat I smack flames
Staten Island's bayside of teachers of Elijah
Thrown out the temple, non-calodic wit the father

P-Double dispose of rap garbage 
Expose novice, trash style, niggas try hardest 
Clowns attempt to rep get slapped the farthest 
I'm P/pee like distinct urine in your staircase 
Nigga, from me stay the most distant, you outta place 
Grime rhyme, my story too foul for primetime 
So I don't give a fuck about MTV

Splash these niggas wit a verse like 

Dead weight, that you could never move and shake 
Demonstrate Live Nigga Rap throughout the states 
Initiate lump sums, all niggas is fake 
Take time out to think before I wrote the page 
Celebrate my type of style dunn, it's a real one 
Kill time, sit around and compare guns 
Me and mines, we a bunch of old times 
Young dudes, while ya'll fuel to argue, we playin it cool 
Boy, niggas got shot for less than words 
Save the speech for those concerned, we squeeze first 
Here's to those who won't hesitate for that 
Dedicated to the type that can relate to that 
Out-of-state clicks understand the cause 
Overseas teams is down wit the fours 
Niggas that can't speak the language repeat the song 
Charged off of doses of this raw 
Yo, it's that shit for your ears to list

Respect ya elders, stay in a child's play
The monotone flow stayin even wit the bass
Oh good Lord, we throw it like a javelin toss
Arrogance is the feature that we added for floss
Come and get headline, destined to get riches
From either rappin our ass off or brick shipments
Cover all regions, makin sure the protty gets spread out
We talk behind the mac you bust lead out
Wit next prospect, no particular concept do we follow
Smooth but yet solid like marble

Niggas ain't fuckin wit D, fuckin wit me
Lookin at me like ""Yo, what can it be?""
In the wide body-7 while you suckin the D
Spent out in the wedge while I'm fuckin for free
Scared to death like you stuck in a tree
I'ma stretch your ass out like I'm cuttin the deed
Frontin like a big man but you stuck in a three
So you know your floss game ain't nuttin to me

Starin up a whole lot of confusion
It's simple, let's move out all these corn cats
And disc jock dissin MC's that got the borin raps
Fuck what ya got, grimy niggas don't want to hear it
Niggas take it, soon as they near it, you better fear it

Triple gooses in the summer
Mean long guns is producin the thunder
Convertible Hummers, we shit on the glock
Try to put the roof up, I'll tell Show to piss on the top
Wrist on the watch, roll wit a click or a glock
Plan on gettin a lot, from spittin or not
Cool wit niggas that be flippin a lot
Probably got shit on your block
And if you hate, I'll take it back to '88 (Nigga, get off the top)
It's two-g's, let's get this money, you wit it or not

So get Tide wit bleach when I rhyme wit beats

I'm the kind to creep on your block wit the heat cocked
Got the street locked, smackin niggas out they Reeboks

Lay my life on the lines if the odds is right

You don't make sense like wearin suede shoes in the snow

You know anything - don't fuck with them Tony

Hot to death, when me and Wop rock the set

What's the deal with all that hypocrisy?
On the real why'all need to stop jockin we

Settin it off, with my monopoly

Yo.. yo yo yo yo yo yo
On some Prodigy shit, chain drop to my dick
No chokers, exotic shit swingin like Sosa
At the Copa, with Tone Toca, opposite of sob-ah
Lots of Henny-lo and Coca-Cola
Blend tape hoe glock tre-eight blowers
Heavyweight holders, got every state sewed up
Niggaz broke? Nah, pockets Al Roker
Budget like Trinidad and De La Hoya
September 18th, Mixtape Kingz walk up in the ring
Grey minks, turntables hangin on links
Poli' with chinks - the main attaction - Wally's dyed pink
Shirt matchin, thug fashion, Thug Passion
compliments of Don King, it's a Don thing
Fuck a drink, still schemein on that charm King
Chill son, put away the toast, make a toast

Take this fuckin shit
You know WHY THE FUCKIN PEOPLE LOVE ME?
Cause I'm FUCKIN REAL!!

[Tony Touch]
Okay..
It's the Return of the Jedi; 
now tell me who the hell said I
couldn't bring it to any boriqua tierras
From L.A. back to N.Y. on the red eye
Toca, holdin it down on the M-I
(The M.O.) used to be ""Listen to My Demo""
All dem vogue now with no problemo
Before I do a show, have my dinero
I'm talkin to all you pendejos!

[Doo Wop]
Yo.. yo yo
My rhymes get spit like a gajo
My nines get the clips with the hollows
Five carat chips in my Movado
Doo Wop, spic half Cubano
who copped six and used to have the milano
who got your main chain vicked at the Apollo
where Eric B. and Rakim would ""Follow, the Leader""
Many nights got my dick swallowed at the Fever
by any white black or Pediqua, Maria, Chiniqua
Had em all player, fucked em and played em
You loved em and date em
Gave em an ultimatum
Talk about that kid Wop, I hate him
So cut him off or I'ma blaze him - 
BROTHER YOU'RE SOFT

[Pain in Da Ass - imitating ""Scarface""]
You come and step to me? Hey FUCK YOU!
Those guys they fuckin talk too much
All they concerned about is fuckin pussy and drinking

Check what the butler, I cut his ass up, somethin' disgusting kid

My custom is, government cheese, chumpin' them steez
Who's a monkey wrench, jumpin' machines get in between, so it seem
It'll only cause a moment of scream
The super seed what I be sayin' is like a king on his knees

I never fall, 'cause the ring on my paw plead forgiveness
Loot for rightness, superstitious, bazooka hit his ass out
Break a suspicious, three sixes of cum
Anti religious, kill 'em off on the first try

Yo my beeper goes off, it's them shorties from out west
Call them back, hit them off on street jack

Blast a pistol, that's when ya start to hear my missile whistle
Jesus, pledge of allegiance to the sole prestigious
With the antidote to make ya wanna bust ya heaters

Release this, I hope ya know that we about to freak this
Fuck discreteness, analyze every nigga weakness
Cut ya face up, then fuck the place up
Pass the L, without the coca lace up, let's pick the pace up

Blow the space up, while ya gaspin' off ransom

There's a lot of hustlin', found around my cheek
Sippin' strawberry daq, that ain't never been fucked
Try to catch me off balance, man, you shit outta luck
Cause we got more rams, and I drivin' y'all
Got the people like the jams, more live than y'all
I'm wit Tone Touch, while ya all touched in the head
Such a lethal combination, got you facin' the red
And um, yo, you don't want no parts in that
You style so pussy, last name should be Cat
We takin it back, like flea stacks and pylons
Wit the ladies in a frenzy, runnin' they nylon
Reveal flesh to test, cause I love bruisin' 'em
Treat my battles like my children nigga, I'm never losin' 'em

Aiyo, what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo
It's Mos, De La, and Touch, we hold the crown yo
Pero what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo
So all my street folk come on gather round yo

Pardon me son, but the only Spanish I knew, was dame un beso
Cut bitches wit niggas, who nettin' the peso
Ya breathin' on beats like this, if you say so
I stay sippin' on God theories, so where the case yo?
Wait flow on four floors like film edits
Fuck sayin' the name, you read it in the credits
Sit that ass down on my lyrics
We servin' niggas up some beans and rice, everything is everything
Heavy metal thing, rock, wit Mos and Pos and us
Written flows get broke down by the comas
From L.I. lawn, I green shit up in my wallets
To fly the wrong places, and get red like scarlet
How I dollar it, I just earn the say
So when the itchy itchy come, I satisfy the crave
And let it fall a little too much
I let Tone touch my ears to let the bullshit disappear

Pa' 'fuera, tu no sabe, mi manera
Native tongue, puttin' it down, donde quiera
De La, Mos Def wit a candela
Borinquen, que bonita bandera
Respect the architect or be next to catch a pela
I send ya all runnin' home to your abuela
Cash rap over a beat or acapella
Kick a wicked rhyme like a fortune teller
This fella, se pone feo quando llego
I still be shoutin' out cats in San Diego
I'm still in effect, and I'm still doin the huevo
I still be putting it down, till I'm a viejo
Man, you can't tell me nothin' about the juego
I told ya suckas before, leggo my eggo
Yet you insist upon playin' wit fuego

Ya heard? - let's do this right, what yo

[X-1]
Hold up, this is for my thugs on the block
For my one stop niggaz that be huggin the spot
Sittin' on crates, gettin' loaded, get that cake
Dodgin' drinks, spit and hafta cover they face

Kick some tye, big truck with tricks inside
In too deep, tryna sell bricks from the side
See no games, with real niggaz from other hoods
Car titles get lost, some niggaz get jooked

But God forgive me if a nigga cross the fam
Holdin the heat, the streets'll make me force ya hand
From my wild crew, sets the new guns off the roof
To them slick dudes, hot and they workin the phone booth

'Cause Lord knows I'm gonna reload and bust back
Incredible gats, indicted for a federal rap
They ain't duck low enough, shots shredded they hat
Murdered and gone, nigga it's a medical fact

[Hook: x 2]
Hold up, this is for my gangsta team
And my dime little mamis rockin Timbs and jeans
When it's on, know we ain't afraid to clap them things
In the club, gettin bent, goin cra-zay!

[Sonsee]
Hold up, this is for my chicks in the spot
All my bus stop bitches that be pushin them drops
Playin' the gate, get it ma, get those papes
Hustle that face, seven G's below ya waist

Project chick, dippin whips, cruisin the strip
Gettin money for tuition, go to school and she strip
Kill in the club, when niggaz dicks get hard
Murda mami set you up and niggaz bricks get robbed

Help her soul if a chick try to set my team
I'm tying her up, rep till the death of Queens
All my staircase niggaz keep flippin the jun's
All my outta state niggaz keep gettin them ones

Guns in the air, hit you with invisible glocks
that mean you never see it comin nigga, 52 shots
I'm takin ya block nigga, if you like it or not
You either roll or get rushed (blaow bloaw!) I guess not

[Hook: x 2]

[Sticky Fingaz]
Sticky Fingaz, the nigga that be stickin them spots
For all my gun-cock niggaz that be bustin off shots
Lay in the straight, black mask raidin ya gate
Show me ya safe before I put two in ya face

Dirt on my kicks, hoodies all lookin for whips
Catch a rat nigga, leave his Bentley sittin on bricks
Bloody ice-pick fights in the yard
Ten times outta ten, step to me and ya life get scarred

Shoot-outs in broad daylight, bustin at feds
Dirty cops with a ki of coke, bring 'em out dead
For my jail niggaz, stashin bangers deep in they cots
For my grimy niggaz, hidin under cars from cops

Empty the glock, hitchu with disposable gats
Bust you, wipe it off, throw it away, it's a rap
What nigga? I see you back in the hood scrap
Turn ya Benz to a coffin nigga, straight like that

Shake ya frame, time to start payin' Kane
Don't make me have to take it there and start sayin' names

Give you official in the middle initial
Yes' we do the thang, don't care who we bang
Quick to bring the belt out on cats like pootytang
I'm that, new we in, mighty supreme being
Names that you thought had heart, but seen fleeing

Rap sire, never tire, call me Messiah
I walk bare foot on hot coals below fire
The type to floss the teeth with barb wire
The type to cross the street in the cross fire

Survivor, not stuck in a job, metaphysical
Go ask your mother, yeah, do what you wanna do

You get dap quick fucking with my mack shit
Around the corner cats with four faces
They scheme and plot, I'm like one shot block
Mass producer, my lyrics is cereal juices

I'm breakin' out tonight, I'm makin' moves kid
Gain collateral, matter of fact it's true
Your beef'll stop when my judo chop chop

We can do it any you want, let's get it on
So, say ya blessings unless you know your lessons
If you do, baby, you better yell those off

Feel these elbows, run those shell toes
Slip a not at all, don't bust one shot at all
Because I go with extra strength like Tylenol
Once connected with Afu, and you know we attack
Come together like Kobe and Shaq

I pull out steel on tracks like everyday
Guess who spray, keep the name shook over here
Play your plee's, just a crook over here

Look over there, cat's is sittin' pretty with the chilly-willy
Cover me son, yo I'm gettin' busy
Yo, we prepare for anything that transpire
Keep ya mouth closed when I pass fire

Slap fire out ya ass 'cause you gettin' too gas
I know my math and I mix it with the razzel-taz
Hide your bling, bling, you ain't down with God
And all the wolves know you left without your body guards

How could it not be hard, we swell dee-sel
Pee-pel feel hell, neck and back like e-zell
Niggas wanna re-bail, follow the dust to the mist
Come and get it, now who's fuckin' with this?

Take a good fucking look at these bad guys
Stay mad fly, mad high 
In the Ford Expidie, and I don't expect to die 
On some humble shit
I am on some rumble shit
When it's on, you should see the shit I come through with
If you scared, by dog, release the four by fours 
I heard the fagot-ass Don died, and he shit in his drawers
On the streets, black; good like Allstate 
Y'all fake
Just got paid, but fuck it, I want some more cake
Ya faith in my hand
Now ya nervous, man, and drive my brains quick fast at ya service

Drunk off the liquor
Shot towards you, mister
Off course, it hit you hard
It gets hard
I pick the card
Any card, any problem I'm a hit your squad
Eyes on the shaper when I twisted God
You think you got it all together
Get it ripped apart
Man, you can't stand the heat
Stay up outta the street
Nigga turn po-lice 'cause they shot up his jeep
I subtract like mad
Don't make me bad
So I want it all; fuck had
Don't make me laugh
By all means
Get this money; it's all green
It's all good
And I wished that y'all would

We smell the musk at the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through ""epidodes ii,"" like ""attack of the clones""
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

I paint a picture with the pen like norman mailer
Me and willa raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the south
Before my nigga core bailed me out
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like bed-stuy through the red sky
With the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some g. rap shit, ""livin' to let die""

Feeling brand new and I jumped up
Feeling my highs, and my lows

Its easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stay drunk
Yo, I activism attackin the system, the blacks and latins in prison
Numbers of prison they victim black in the vision
Shit and all they got is rappin to listen to
I let them know we missin you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin you
Now, why would I lie? just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The tv got us reachin for stars
Not the ones between venus and mars, the ones that be readin for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners Sunday morning at the feet of the father
They need somethin to rely on, we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

We rock like paul mccartney from now until the last beatle drop

Just to get by, for a piece of the pie

We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly

When, the people decide, to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs

Or catch him swingin pain(?) bottles in the club
Won't catch me with the police without cuffs

Can't press me into no threatenin position
Probably spot me, steppin out the tree spot tough
Catch P fixin his pants, it's cause of his gun
You see the God, big ol' chains, but can't stick him

What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
You want to take my chips I want to take you on trips
So you can help me get my won
Go ahead try it for me here's the story of my money
I'm the owner and I do more than bone you
Maybe help you in fam like Princeton Apollonia
You looking right I see you hooking the night
But something about you got me pushing up tight
Do that dance like Aphrodite cause you mighty
Might be the trick that make me trip just slightly
Your eyes twist and your breast acts on times as hittin'
If it ain't love it is thuggish just smithin'
I'm felling on ya like I'm reading your aura
So, and I hope that I can see you tomorrow
Remembering your face like this
And be chased like this
What you doing in a place like this?

And I think I'm getting you in a major way
Just a nice girl, in the wrong place
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whatcha doin' in a place like this?

What's a nice girl like you doing here like this?
Busting your heels like this, I know you feel like shit
And you feel like calling it quits, but you need that dough
Paying for school I can see that yo
You're intelligent similar to Angelo
I'm understanding you, I got big plans for you
Your (?) got you going places
You chasing money, ain't no funny faces
You s-serious, just delirious
You like your little outfit, I like the way you wear it
You say your last man was too jealous
Your too young to settle down, girl I let you tell 'em
You're not a video chick not a groupie
Just an ambitious young woman with juicy lips
Remembering your face like this
And be chased like this
What you doing in a place like this

[Chorus:]

What's a nice lady doing in place so shady?
Your innocent stare and there your hair so crazy
Conversation stimulating you with
You got me the big one, taking you with me
I'm in the back drinking Yak, with you on my lap
Give me a dance cause this is my track
You holdin' it down for your own fam'
You wasn't happy with your last old man
Ma, you're doing things your way
You're making your own pay
Gotta have a business of your own one day
Hon it ain't nothing to it, I want to see you do it
I tell you one thing, your last man blew it
A perfect blend of beauty and brains
It's my duty to expand what you doing to me

See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

I'm in the cut in the club
Scopin the scene
Cup half way full
Smokin the green
She got her hand on my nuts
What does that mean?
Pointed at her friend
And she said, they'll tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true
Its like I'm dreamin
When I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mike mami
Mic check one two
Drunk in the club
Off the chain
But who gives as fuck?
That's why I came
So pour it up
And get down
Ya'll have no choice
But to listen to Pit now

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Broke niggaz (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

Everybody knows
Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club
DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is
""Does he got cash?""
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them eastside boys smoke out
Roll another one
No doubt
Get a couple hoes
Roll out
Beef, you don't want none
To go down
dumb diddy dumb dumb

The city I'm from
Is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run
Your crew run run
Its next to come

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It don't involve money then (back up)

I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinning
Like some sprewells
Skip the details
Its the vodka bottom line
that's testin my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars
All that's bullshit
If that's what your lookin for
Keep lookin hoe
Cause you got the wrong one bitch
I'll let you know
Mami's like damn
That Cuban's shot out
Bitch I came to the club
To wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch

Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
Cos we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our
Own funny moods
I've got mine,
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me by now
You will never
Never never know me",If You Don't Know Me by Now,2001

Your riden?
I got my own after party

Tu why yo cuando acabe este party
La noche espera en un cuarto aparte
Seducirnos por este baile
Agamos el amor esta noche

Girl, you know that this club is about to be closed
The night is getting low
But I was still hoping that we can go
Have our own after party
I wanna make sweet love to your body

No tardes mas , no tarde mas
Vente vamonos why agamos el amor
No tardes mas , no tarde mas
Vente vamonos why agamos el amor

Despues de este baile te quiero llevar
Despues de este baile te quiero tocar
Despues de este baile yo quiero invitarte
Agamos el amor esta noche

And when I look into your eyes
Getting on my sense
That right here tonight
You won't have a cent

Put that in my ride
Without you by my side
'Cause even though I just met you
I wanna be with you tonight

And I hope that this ain't hard
For you to understand
I'm not some kind of lien
I'm a soldier and a man

See the mind up in the drains
All the way that we dance
All I really know
It's tonight, I want your hand

Se que te voy a hacer el amor
En el baño, en la cama o en el suelo
Gastar mis energias
Sacar el mayor probecho
Ya que estamos envueltos

Seducidos por la misma razon
Es como salir de un sueño
Vamos a acerlo , lentamente tu why yo
Sudando

Tu why yo cuando acabe este party
La noche espera en un cuarto aparte
Seducirnos por este baile
Agamos el amor esta noche

Despues de este baile te quiero llevar
Despues de este baile te quiero tocar
Despues de este baile yo quiero invitarte
I wanna make sweet love to her body

Te tengo aki mami en casa
Donde queria desde el principio

Tony Vacca,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002

Que le doy de todo que estoy atrapado
Y que ya a cambiado mi forma de ser

Que no eres la misma, que sin mi lloraste
Y que aun mereces todo mi querer

Déjame solo vivir esta vida que sabe a ternura
Por más que llores que ruegues
No pienso romper mi atadura
Esa mujer que tu ofendes tan fácil limpio mis heridas

Volvió a levantarme del suelo donde tú me dejaste
Esa mujer que tú llamas infame merece respeto

Tony Vega,"Porque he andado los caminos y conozco el desatino
Comprobé que todo pasa por que tiene una razón
Cuando a veces nos cegamos fu que no quisimos ver
Y el porqué de equivocarnos casi siempre es aprender
Como locos damos vueltas en la rueda de la vida
Sin siquiera darnos cuenta que uno mismo es quien la gira

Uno mismo se enreda, uno mismo se ordena
Uno mismo se hunde, uno mismo se eleva
Uno mismo se encierra y se corta las alas
Uno mismo se enferma, uno mismo se sana
Uno mismo se odia o uno mismo se ama

Solo muy de vez en cuando descubrimos la verdad
Cada vez es más difícil arrancar un antifaz
Nos volvemos marionetas en las manos del destino
Por temor a confrontarnos ser muecos preferimos

Uno mismo se aleja, uno mismo regresa
Uno mismo se pierde, uno mismo se encuentra
Uno mismo es su suerte y más allá de la muerte
Uno mismo es la niebla, uno mismo es la llama
Uno mismo se enciende, o uno mismo se apaga

Uno mismo se pierde, uno mismo regresa

La vida nos ofrece a todos escoger entre dos sendas
Tú decides si escoges la mala
Tú decides si escoges la buena
Somos como la llama, uno mismo se enciende
Uno mismo se apaga

Uno mismo se pierde, uno mismo regresa

Cuando a veces nos cegamos fue que no quisimos ver
Y el por qué de equivocarnos, casi siempre es aprender

Uno mismo se pierde, uno mismo regresa

Somos responsables de nuestra felicidad
Que uno mismo comienza
Después de andar esos caminos
Uno mismo se odia o uno mismo se ama

Tony Vega,"Ella está dispuesta a verme donde sea
A cambiar su vida si se lo pidiera
Es capaz de todo por robarse un beso
Por una caricia y por más que eso.

Ella es el amor que duele cuando no se tiene cerca de la piel
Como el mar en calma que de pronto arrasa con mi timidez
Cuando la encontré yo supe que era la mujer que había esperado siempre es
El amor que un día soñé

Yo por ella lucharé aunque me cueste el alma
Aunque arriesgue todo en casa es
La pasión hecha mujer, lo que yo esperaba
La razón cediendo al paso de este amor
Desenfrenado es, ella es

Yo soy para ella un jardín prohibido
Sabe bien mi historia nunca le he mentido
Se me parte el alma cuando a veces llora
Y sueña despierta que ella es mi señora

Ella es el amor que duele cuando no se tiene cerca de la piel
Como el mar en calma que de pronto arrasa con mi timidez
Cuando la encontré yo supe que era la mujer que había esperado siempre es
El amor que un día soñé

Yo por ella lucharé aunque me cueste el alma
Aunque arriesgue todo en casa es
La pasión hecha mujer, lo que yo esperaba
La razón cediendo al paso de este amor
Desenfrenado es, ella es

Mi vida por siempre te amaré

(Ella es el amor que duele cuando no se tiene cerca de la piel)
Ella es ese amor prohibido que no puede ser....
(Ella es el amor que duele cuando no se tiene cerca de la piel)
El que destroza el alma por no tenerlo cerca de la piel

Por ese cariño pase lo que pase yo lucharé

Aunque ponga en juego lo que tengo contigo me arriesgaré

Dime a caso volverá o ya me ha borrado de su piel
Para siempre dime amiga la verdad nada tienes
Que temer ella merecía encontrar al fin alguien
Que la quiera bien que no fuera yo

Amigo que no diera por basarla por un poco de su calma
En mis noches de delirio amigo me paso por descuidarla
Por dejar de echarla agua al jardín de su cariño

Si yo vuelvo a encontrarla le pediré que me perdone
Esta vez si yo vuelvo a encontrarla voy a poner
Toda mí a vida a sus pies esta vez no fallare
Voy a hacer lo imposible por recuperar su fe si
Yo vuelvo a encontrarla

De esos momentos
Intensos de amor desatados

Cuando no puedas dormir
Pensando en las cosas
Que has vuelto a sentir

Haremos el amor a media luz
Haremos el amor a manos llenas

Haremos el amor enamorados
Haremos el amor de norte a sur
Haremos el amor apasionados

No sientas vergüenza de hacerlo otra vez
Juro que nunca sabrán que tú y yo nos amamos

Búscame yo acudiré siempre
Al lugar donde quieras verme

Cuando nos puedas dormir
Pensando en las cosas que has vuelto a sentir
Búscame haré que tu piel sienta el calor
Que con los años no guardé

Cuando nos puedas dormir
Pensando en las cosas que has vuelto a sentir
Búscame en nuestro lecho secreto recordaremos
Momentos intensos

Cuando nos puedas dormir
Pensando en las cosas que has vuelto a sentir
Búscame haremos el amor enamorados

The minute you let her under your skin

Los embates de un pasado horrible y cruel

Que mi tristeza no te puede hacer volver

Tony Vincent,"Sometimes hiding in my soul
Fear and pain too deep to ever know
I ran from what I did not understand
Until your mercy took control

I was running through a maze of questions
When the answer came to me
Beyond all words
Now I'm trembling in your presence
Broken by a love that moves
Beyond all words

So afraid to feel your touch
Fearing love would cost me far too much
All it cost me was my foolish pride
When I finally opened up inside

[Chorus]
I can't explain this feeling
Indescribable
Beyond all words
You alone offered hope and healing
Peace and comfort comes
Beyond all words
Resting in a perfect stillness

I could speak with the tounges of men
I could whisper the language of heaven

It's a far cry from love

I could open the doors of a mystery
Turn all the shadows to light
Keep faith when the odds are against me
Believe when I'm loosing my sight

But it's a far cry from love
It's a far cry from love
It's a far, far cry from love

All my passion, my tears and my blood
Sacrifice will never be enough
I don't have a heart of love
I am nothing more
Than hollow fading words
Nothing without love

I could open my arms to the hungry
Fight to keep flesh on their bones
Surrender my body for burning
Lay down everything that I own

It's a far, far cry from love

Far beyond your years
Try to take a stand
Holding all command

Losing their appeals
Now your pallet's changed
Look for other meals
Production short
Take it all to count
Wanting victory
But you come up short
Responsibility is not a word you want to hear or read
When will priorities change

Associations, proclamations, giving ways to rule the nations
But while convincing and evincing
We're leaving out the one we've been missing

You're always talking loudly
You're only talking to yourself
You look inside for answers
When they'll be found in someone else
Do you hear what I'm speaking
Or am I talking to myself
I never caught the vision
Until I looked high

Tradition's views
Causing you to lose
In the other ones
Still you've one to choose
The time is near
For a tried career
Invest in truth
While the pictures clear
What is the plan, stan, to make a boy into a man
When will our attitude change-change

But we invent a monument
Instead of showing what he meant",High,1995

There's no rhyme
There's no reason
Must be the season

He says he's coming back
But he knows he's not coming back again

Had not surrendered to the call
The pull was strong enough
To bend my will and break my fall

Said that we could trust him and believe

Too insecure to live by faith
We're always looking for some other way

Shake, shake, shake the money tree
Shake, shake, shake the money tree

Trusting in ourselves

You gotta-gotta work that business deal

Pouring my heart out unto you- and listening too
Resting in your perfect love- I can't get enough

Drove a hook in my soul drew me over to the door
Seems it got the best of me
Oh, I opened it a crack, you kicked it in
Turned it upside down, - won't be the same again

Good can be found , little one
From the rise of the moon to the setting sun
Open your mind, just open your window tonight
Touched with a hand that can heal
You can find what you lost from the hands that steal
Open your heart, just open your window tonight

I've seen you tracing the road where I moved
The wind in your hair, the skin of an angel
Beauty is there, still your trying to feel
A promise to cling, a love that is real not 
Lies, what the picture tries to hide
The lights, only blind what really matters...here

But if you believe
Can you receive
Without your fellow man (you've got to)

Reach out
Give yourself to someone
Who's in need of healing
Reach out
And in turn you might find
All the love you're seeking

Is it enough
Just to show up
With all your best intentions
Playing it safe
Make no mistake
And the door will open
I know your name
'cause I'm just the same
Doing the best I can

Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy,i need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come,easy go,
A little high,little low,
Anyway the wind blows,doesn't really matter to me,
To me

Mama,just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,
Mama,life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on,carry on,as if nothing really matters

Too late,my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go,will you let me go
Bismillah, no,we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,for me,for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,nothing really matters to me,

An extra pair of arms is what you really need
But keep the secret, today no one can touch you
Dine on passion, then let your heart bleed
Alone at night it's dark
Hear a lonely dog bark

Tony Visconti,"We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died along, a long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World",The Man Who Sold the World,2012
