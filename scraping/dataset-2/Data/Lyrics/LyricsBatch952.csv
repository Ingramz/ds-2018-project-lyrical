Ronnie Milsap,"Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy can play

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him, some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode",Johnny B. Goode,1995

Ronnie Milsap,"You make my eyes run over all the time
You're happy when I'm out of my mind
You don't love me but you won't let me be
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?

You must think, I look bad with a smile
For you haven't let me wear one, in such a long, long while
Still I keep coming back, how can this be?
Don't you ever get tired of hurting me?

You must think, I look bad with a smile

Ronnie Milsap,"He got the sunshine, I got the rain
He got your loving, I got the pain
He got a lifetime of love to see him through
I got the memories, he got you.

He got your good times, I got the bad
He got your sweet side, I got the sad
He got forever to make your dreams come true
I got your letter goodbye, he got you.

Sometimes the wine taste bitter
Sometimes the wine taste sweet
Sometimes the only road I can see
Leads me right back to your feet.

Ronnie Milsap,"Stranger Things Have Happened Lyrics
I keep talking to your picture
But a smile is all you say.
It's a lonely conversation,

But missing you is easier this way.
Last night a shadow filled the doorway,
And I heard footsteps on the stairs.
Then I woke up this morning,

And thought I saw you standing there.
Stranger things have happened,
And I'll always believe,
If stranger things can happen,

You could still come back to me.
One touch is worth a thousand pictures.
What might have been ain't worth a dime.
I just hope someday I'll hold you,

Another place, some other time.
Stranger things have happened,
And I'll always believe,
If stranger things can happen,

You could still come back to me.
If stranger things can happen,
You could still come back to me.
Stranger things have happened...",Stranger Things Have Happened,1995
Ronnie Milsap,"Without you in my life every night seemed like a lifetime.

The clock on the wall never seemed to move at all
Or was it just my mind.
Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast.

[Chorus]
Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like? Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?

If I had a time machine, I'd make the daylight seem like fleeting
Moments
And every single night would be exactly like the night that we spent
But it won't be long until I'm alone with my desire
'Cause the stars are going out and my heart is still on fire,
Tell me where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, where do the nights,
Where do the nights go?

[Chorus]

Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast, tell me.

Ronnie Milsap,"It came to me again tonight 
Here in this smoky place
Suddenly a fleeting memory
in the image of your face

so i paid for my check, buttoned my coat
stepped into an evening rain
made my way down the avenue
softly whispering your name

Still losing you
still losing you
something inside of me
keeps hanging on even though you're gone
Still losing you
Oh I'm still losing you

I dialed your number long distance
I heard a stranger say
The party you have tried to reach
Has recently moved away

I was a fool for leaving you
when you needed me so much
Now I'm the victim of a restless heart
That refuses to forget your touch

Still losing you
still losing you
Something inside of me
Just keeps hanging on even though you're gone
Still losing you
Oh i'm still losing you

Maybe someday I'll learn to live with this regret
Till then my heart will go on trying to forget 

That i'm still losing you
Still losing you 
something inside of me
Keeps hanging on even though you're gone
Still losing you
Oh i'm still losing you",Still Losing You,1996

Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you.

Happy, happy, birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget.

'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty, I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too.

Ronnie Milsap,"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night,1997
Ronnie Milsap,"Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch

Ronnie Milsap,"I turn on the radio and hear your favorite song
And all day long I hum the melody
When I see that special look
Between two people so in love
I remember how it was with you and me.

[Chorus]
Everywhere I turn there's your memory
The image of you burning up inside me
It's almost more than I can do
To think of anything but you
'Cause everywhere I turn there's your memory.

If I go somewhere with friends
Someone's sure to mention you
Then some old familiar feeling steals back in
When I go to sleep at night you're still filling up my dreams
How I wish you could fill up my arms again.

Ronnie Milsap,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""
Darling, I will understand.

What goes on when the sun goes down

Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it 
Hey teach me tonight

When there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping

When it comes to rockin' she's a queen
Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on a twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet

We need an understanding heart

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street caf‚

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

WRITER DAVE BURGESS

Now there's a little place that I know about
I go there with my baby everytime I take her out
We park by the rock and watch the lights down below
And I tell her things that she ought to know
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
I just can't wait for Saturday night
We'll park by the rock in the pale moonlight
I'll grab my baby and steal a kiss and then
I know she'll be stealin' it right back again
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on
Well, everybody's got a little place they call their own
Where they can always go when they wanna be alone
Lover's rock is the best around
It's a short way up but it's a long way down
They call it Lover's rock, they call it Lover's rock
Well, everybody's rockin' and there's very little talkin'
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' goin' on

Check complexion and pose
See the chosen be chose
Then I turn up your nose

It's mandatory I snatch her 
'Cause the statues'll knock at ya
Spend some time with Po-yo

High school I was a fool I was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rollin' a foregin car through the streets of Third Ward
It was hard momma saw me with a case of Codeine
And Promethazyne now I'm the Codeine fiend
And my team was the coldest everyday we rolled thick

This is for my niggas in the cage, living in a rage
See mo-yo done turned the page
Put down the yay, it's me my mic and my stage
From the cradle to the grave
See I keep a bald fade
Stay clean and on Codeine and lemonade

We melt them trays yea hit it in the six
That purple stuff wit a cup of the mix
That sounded so throwed and believe it so throwed
I can't believe its so slow

Windows closed cruise control wit some lil' doe
Bout to loose her clothes there she go
Hoe tripping again she pancaked I flipped 8
And let me flip her again
Its been a long, long time coming
 
But it won't be a long time for long huh

Every time I come around what do I see?
I see ghetto dreams coming true
Every time I'm coming down on things
Top down everyday got to ball and parlay

Ronnie Spencer,"[Chorus: Z-Ro]
I'm still a player, a confidential player
I'm just trying to do something right, so let me live my life
Even though I'm still hustling, I know you want to see me struggling
But at least I'm trying to do something right so let me live my life

[Tyte Eyez]
Lord knows I had my share of doing the wrong things
But a bonified player that finds the life in me
Casualties make us cry but still we got to mash
Keep my eyes up on the sparrow and mind, up on my cash

Penetrate, finish last maintain a steady pace
Keep the busters out your business and haters up out your face
In this last rat race, the lord some's got to come
Shrivel my signature I call it rapping refunds

The ones that criticize be the ones you call your friends
The ones that ride it out ain't gone always be your kin
But then, you got to know, if it's yours you gone get it
But also you got to know that everyday, ain't terrific

Precision about your plans, keep it real with your fans
Watching my baby boy grow to be a young man
My daughter got to know, from the jump you a queen
And f*** what them n****s say you tell them your daddy is a king

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Everytime I look around
These haters they be talking down
Big Moe that done bring more light
I even had a, had a harder time

But I'm still here still going strong
You can't believe what you hear in the song
About the year two triple o three
Whole wide world sipping drank with me

I got money but I'm still a little stressed
I thank the lord cause you know I'm the best
A little love set with the press
Why you want less cause through this

I guess it's best for me, to stay calm
And hold it down till the day that I'm gone
I got a white cup in my palm
Feel what a peach crush Mo-Yo's just a
Player, player, player, player

[Z-Ro]
Money, the rule to all evil that's what I need
Between the hours of 3 to 7, that's when I bleed
Motherf***ers gone making the block hot, so I stay and move around
Tyte Eyez and Z-Ro stacking paper, it's going down

Break the shop of a n**** that's short stopping my change
But me and him to the fullest ducking bullets at close range
Feeling crazy, like I'm a lose my life to a b**** n****
But while I'm here I be a rich n****

Nephews and nieces, niece cool clothes and chains and pieces
I break bread with my family when my record releases
Besides skills in the west, n**** got mouths to feed
Anything against the grain just light a finger spot over seas

Saturday morning as a youngster I ain't have no bike
And I ain't have no Nikes, but in the triple I'ma have more ice
Around my neck and my wrist with fern doors
Z-Ro, confidentially yours a player

See momma was a hustler, daddy was a buster, y'all know how that go
I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'm a state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs
Man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you wanna know what's in my cup

Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff

Now now now
That 'Purple Stuff', that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'm a go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, clipper
Catch a playa leanin impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the fo' wit a Crush Pineapple
Gotti gon' last long but I ain't sippin wit dat bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a playa had about enough

Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

[Al-D]
Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[K-Rino]
Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[Yungstar]
Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

I'm at the point, of no return
Caught up in this game, everybody know my name
I got, money to burn

[Ronnie Spencer]
I've been struggling, started off with nothing
Everybody know me, as the one to do thangs for free
Right now, I'm on the grind
See you got yours, I gotta get mine
See the most high, gave me a sign
He said son, it's your time

[Hook: x 2]

[Dirty]
I'm at the crossroad in my life, and baby it's do or die
Fall or floss, small or cry could mean slow suicide
On these streets scratching for my keep, grinding for my people
When you're not treated equal, it's so hard to live legal

Will my seed deceive em, to this never ending saga
Fascinated by cash cars, and clothes just like our papa
Taking mo' gambles than Pac did, in pursuit of the dolla
On the verge of crapping out, from money and power

Having big body dreams, and wood grain wishes
Trying to taste the good life, cause it looks so delicious
Man the pressure's tremendous, so I smoke on spinach
Trying to find some piece of mind, than get caught from behind

Mashing for the finish line, in this cruel millennium
Make mo' shine than lime, I'm spending more than time
Rocking pie with dimes, keep the top reclined
Use to be caught up in grind, now addicted to rhyme

[Hook: x 2]

[Ronnie Spencer]
Never turn my back, on what's real to me
That's my love, for my Wreckshop family
I had my share of likes, up's and down's
And thank goodness, I'm still around

Never could, make it on my own
When I'm looking in the sky, and I'm feeling so fly
But though one day, you're here
Then the next day, you're gone

[Tyte Eyez]
I'm at the point of no return, and ain't no looking back
'Cause there's ends I got to meet, big faces I got to stack
They say man'll make the money, but money'll make us move
Positions to get richer, a seven figga made dude

Calm on the cool, collecting cash flow
Keep my bidness on the low, prepared to drop my solo
The new millennium, Mr. Tyte E-Z
And if I turn my back now, then my kids won't eat

My wolf pack won't sleep, until we slay all prey
Get vicious without perdition in this Y2K
This feddy is in my vision, in this hectic paper chase
Wrecking my lyrical weapon, pimp the pen at a steady pace

Appreciate God pressing, no cases and no bars
Frauds and changed faces, but my game's up to par
A ghetto shooting star, and I ain't trying to go back
To the guns and the slums, and the jacks or the crack

Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love 

To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense

The response in action to light bulb irrations

So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

Ronny Jordan,"Did I ever tell you about the man who changed my life?
The one I thought, oh. Lord, when I saw him walkin' back in that bar, all tall and
lean with them broad shoulders, sweet lips, I knew that I had died and gone to
Chocolate Heaven

He had a real deep voice, white pearly teeth, his shoe was always shiny.
Long slender fingers manicured perfectly.
The man wore 800-dollar Italian suit, straight from, I dunno, what would they call it,
Milan or Rome or someplace like that?

I knew it wasn't local. 
I said, I got to get next to that.
I haven't seen him in a long time. 
The man was so fine, he could get any good girl into trouble
Can you guess what his name was?
Well
'The Jackal'
'The Jackal'
Say. 
'The Jackal' 

He was fat back cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin' at a quarter after 5.
Twist of lime, Coke on the side.
The brother loved the high life. 
Had a Ph.D. in street stride.
They called him 'The Jackal'.

He was big Mack daddy super black stylin' a diamonds in the back Cadillac.
Fur-lined boards, white wall wheels, cruise control, built for speed, chrome on evray-thang.
And stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them.
When they called him
'The Jackal'.
Say. 
'The Jackal'.

Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard, livin' fast, livin' large, 6 foot 4 and not an ounce of fat!
When women asked, 'is you a Cat?' He said 'I did more that that.
I'm the firmest of the firm
And in case you, hadn't known, they call me 'The Jackal'.

Served the 18-year bid First Reicker's Island then they hid him in the state
penitentiary. Said the charge was Grand Larceny.
That was 1975, and today, if he's still alive, he'd be living in the park.
Hm. The brother whose claim to fame was that they called him 'The Jackal'.

We breeze up and down the street
We get respect from the people we meet
They make way day or night
They know the in crowd is out of sight

Yo, I speak in whole beat legends
Divide it up in parts and sections
Days I was ministerin' sectors
Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election
Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents
Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense
Blew up the room in my absence
Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion
The response in action to light bulb irrations
I come from where anything can happen and usually does
You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun

Yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (move on)

Begun, brighter day, brighter day
Came away, came away and I flew away, flew away high, so high
I will fly (fly, whoa) fly away, fly away, fly away

Ronny Jordan,"Overcast future and the past riding on a dime
 No control ever will hold of my life
 But inside the darkest night is the day
 So listen to the words of life that I heard my father say (he said)
 [Chorus]
 Keep your head up to the sky don't be shy
 Trust in what you know is right and I?ll provide -repeat
 can't find a job for money will rob or do I have to sling (don?t mean a thing)
 Question fate who do I have to hate in order to be great
 But if love is the key what else to I need to be a success (I want to be blessed)
 Believing in the one is how I've begun to be great

Was auch grad' boomt, ich hab' Bang dafür
Bring dir Musik, die du endlich fühlst
Töte Beats, nur damit du dich lebendig fühlst
Hater, glaubst du, ich will den Support? Wäre so wie Beihilfe zum Mord
Dein Idol ich kill' es sofort
Guck, wie ich skille mit'm Wort
Rasiere wie'n Wilkinson Sword
Mach' mit Finesse, weck' das Interesse
Während ihr klatscht wie die Presse
Gibt's Bass in die Fresse, massige Bässe
Ich hustle, ich schleppe den Stuff in die Städte
Für die Reise gemacht so wie Pässe
Ich nehm' mir nur meins so wie Abzieh-Geschäfte
Ich schmatz', währ'nd ich esse
Opfer gebracht, schwarze Messe, unfassbare Texte, ich mach's
Hiesige Songkritiker haben ihn jetzt auf'm Kieker, staun', wie ich dauernd liefer'
Liefer' mehr als Dealer, die das Weed und Cocaina in dem Siebener noch zu dir fahr'n
Die Musik ist unbesiegbar, hat massives Format
Dieser Bass verbiegt den Unterkiefer wie ich schieße unparierbar
Nur die coolen DJs spielen unsere Lieder, miese Miezen pumpen's
Lieber als die Beatles, kriegen direkt Dschungelfieber
Vögel verlieren Titel und Gefieder
Wie Pestizide eliminier' ich Ungeziefer
Brauch' für euch Kinder nur 'n Spielplatz und 'ne KiTa
Tanz um die MCs herum - Nikeata
Die Industrie kann mich nicht mehr aufhalten
Weil sie von der Straße zum Club und zurück zum Schulhof meine Tracks spiel'n
Ihr dachtet, ich hör' einfach zu, wie diese Vögel mit der Kacke Kohle machen und die Kultur in den Dreck zieh'n
Tokat macht dich wieder breit, Whisky
Hustle mit den Liedern kein Nipsey
Nein man, das ist Mega und ich weiß auch alles besser und ich scheiß' auf alle Rapper, finde wieder kein Dixi
Kam in Frieden und ich nehme keine Gefangenen, aber heißt nur, dass ich gleich richte
Dr. Coop schwingt die Bleispritze, donner' über den Beat und schmeiß' Blitze

Kommst du zu mir, willst du Frisches holen
Weißt du, was du kriegst, brauch' es nicht beton'
Kenn' sie sich aus, ham sie mich empfohlen
Huh, Händler mit der Ware und schon länger in der Lage
Geh' auf Beats, so als ob ich eine Gang dahinter habe
Hör zu, denn der Banger is' so Blamage
Dieser Sound hier ist Bruce Wayne bei Nacht, Bruce Banner mit der Rage
Enterte das Rap-Biz, kam ins Game und beendete die Wackness
Leg' nach und beende deine Skepsis
Höre nicht auf, bis die Veränderung perfekt ist
Im Untergrund am Ackern wie mit Bohrer und mit Bagger
Flow ist Strobo wie bei Gabber, alles frisch wie Tau
Ohne wenn und aber, dieser größte Motherfucker

Aus Liebe zur Sache und Max ist mein Helfer
Von niemand' erschaffen, ich machte es selber
Das Business, die Neider, sie machten mich kälter
Die Sorgen, Familie, sie machten mich älter
Frag mal die Jungs hier am Block, wie's ihnen geht, was ihnen fehlt ist Perspektive
Keine Kohle um mein Album zu supporten, aber jeden Tag 'n Zehner für die Wiese
Ich cutte durch die Wolken, laufe schneller als die Schatten, die mir folgen
Mache, was ich mache, meine Sache, mach die Sachen, bis die Sachen mir Erfolg bringen
Lass es brennen, Gemüter sind erhitzt und ich frag mich ob sie das hier wirklich wollten

Rony Weiss,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in

The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night [From Phantom of the Opera],1994

'Cause you've seen the webs you spun,
You're versed in vice and virtue 
But this time your vice has won,
But when hopelessness would tell you 
That your better days are done,
Have no fear you'll overcome

There are times when you might feel 
That there's nothing left to hold,
That every time you lift your chin 
Your faults have laid you low,
But mercy's in the mightiest and mighty is the judge,
He will lift you up above

And you'll say 
Now I am a heart with a head on my shoulders 
And I can say that I'm a different child",Different Child,2016
Roo Panes,"I tried to part the sea,
Find wonders for your love,
I sought the best of me,
But all I showed was what I couldn't be,
Your hush was a beauty I'd not seen,
Your kindness made a gentle wreck of me

Once hope found hope,
And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home,
The rest of me will roam into tomorrow, my love,
For tomorrow there's love, there's love

I climbed the highest heights where the sightless go to see,
Fixed fate with steely eyes told her it was not the time for me,
But some things that you give you can't retrieve,
And I wait for a day I'll never see

Once hope found hope,
And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home,
The rest of me will roam into tomorrow, my love,
For tomorrow there's love, there's love

It was like the moon tide,
Always rise and then fall,
But now its dead and I'm done,
And I won't cry for you no more

I the lonely captive stand with only memories to hold my hand,
But I'd not change a single thing twas the best and worst of time,
Beneath the yellow clouded moon,
Where buried hopes rise from their tombs,
The whispers call to heaven above,
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love

Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love,
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love",Once,2016

Tell me why

Think I’ll write a tale of my own

She spent some time out there in California
(And I'd sing)
This could be something incredible
Or not worth my time

Then she listened to me in disguise
I never knew she paid attention
With Florida on her mind

Back before the day that all this went away
Those times meant everything
I'd give up everything for this now

And all we are is all we are
The same

Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!",Doodlin',1957

Roots Manuva,"[Chorus x5]
I'm inna

[Verse One]
There were trendy wannabes staring in my face
As I stepped to the place I could taste eclair
Tall head, small head, enough shape to hair
Swinging out blabber with the coin to spare
Me myself, I only got five quid to spend and
Once I've broken this note my pockets on a bend
Supping on a brew so my vibe gets stirred
Feeling kind of brave as my vision is blurred
Skeets in the place, they blow my mind
I rehearse my approach and I bides my time
Second thoughts of last one, these stress my nights
So I was just content with them sights
Were me and my jack-joan, alone getting down
Freaking to the sound as the bass spins around
I'm inna..

[Chorus x4]
I'm inna

[Verse Two]
Clutching at the bar side, taking in the view
Press luck, trying to scrounge me a next pint of brew
Find a relevant spot, see I know nobody
So I assume the role of some tender somebody
To attract the attention of some cat with some doe
Be it Jane or Flo', I'm slick-quick, got flow
Looking down at my feet, 'tender' written cross my face
Hoping some skee aids my case
Twenty minutes pass and I gets no joy
I bring storm-dinner gear 'fore my plan deployed
It was a skee behind the bar, almost dark as me
Needed a drink so her dream lover had to be me
I said 'Honey, I love the way you work that square
I know you's a ten and you got nice hair'
I blew she two kisses, two tries and I misses
Third time lucky, I'm hitting the target
She's warming to my vibe, looking deep into my eyes
I'm spewing out lies but she's none the wiser:
'I can't find my bredren with my twenty pound note
I'm feeling kind of hoarse in the throat?'
She steps to the brew tap, pumps me a brew
I said 'Hon, I really don't expect this of you'
Pushed the brew to my hand and I grips it tight
Turns her back and I slips out of sight
I'm inna..

[Chorus x4]

[Verse Three]
Back in the midst of them sweaty boogie folks
A cat comes up and tries to sell me some smoke
'What you got, weed or hash?' He said 'Hash'
'I don't smoke that but I'll take a quick blast'
It was a potent cocktail, this hash and brew
I flips, acting like I'm not known to do
Strips down to my waist, I was feeling hot
Getting wild sensations from my head to my ___
In a drunken stupour, sweating on this skeet
Company of us cats, they didn't want to keep
In came my bartending friend and two bouncers
Accusing me of theft, Lord knows I should've left
But this buzz in me was like grinning up my jaw
Before I knew shite I were flat 'pon the floor
Inna, man..

[Chorus x8]",Inna,1999
Roots Manuva,"(Great Scott! I say, old bean)
This happens to be the article of fusion
Huh! The roots-fi discotheque
As we move

It's that jet-black flow from the southwest of illo n d-o-n
The second nature of the vent dem rebel routine
I scheme and plot, ain't no use in stepping if we don't step hot
Let the movements be made, there's goals to be getting
No second for no love or no fettin
Why there's all these ugly mans on my TV screen?
I wrap my head with foil so I don't catch so I don't catch them beams
The sound of half a downer don't pray fi step solo
We far flung frontier, captain kirk, the sun trekker
Full time I climb, my chip deeper taught as I sow seeds of thought
The fruits of the roots, a vision of splendid splendidness
Now be proud to be spittin in the face of the beast
With each and every move I make, every shite I break
You might watch me but I watch you too
Ain't a thing you can do to stop me!

[Chorus 2x]
Whom wants this or that
Watch these enzymes react
How we juggle tings proper
Man, don't

When I swing I'm far fetched like hicks from hicksville
High steps got me trippin from Peckham to Bucks Hill
Still I stand firm through the strife conflict
Motion slick, hip to every ring poli-trick
So I spread love like Lennon and Yoko Ono
Keep vibes slow-mo for a ho-tential
Don't go callin me coon, you'll catch a boot to your jaw
We pro-black, freak that, can't sweep no floor
I heard those my people, them burst their backs
Work hard for eons and paid tax and have not seen jack
In return, how does shit burn
It could well make a guy lose sense and rationale
Onto kamikazes on shifting streets
It's eyeball for eyeball and teeth for teeth
While we spin on this ball of confusion
I sight no solution, cesspits just get more frowsy
Chemical rain got me drunken and drowsy
Rowdy, I got no choice but to be
The living example of a root-fi youth type soldier
Bowling through like there ain't no tomorrow
Brave them terrains of pain and deep sorrow
But still keep sliding on, I try to make sense of the madness
But it seems like I'm wasting my time, it's best I just
Go get me mine, find some inner peace
Climb to higher heights, embrace the light

[Chorus 2x]

This living dead noose, the bane of life in the west
But who's down for civil unrest?
In times like these comrades is hard to find
The beast keeps the masses toeing the line
With them sneaky tactics they'll keep them boys running
So they can have a market for their guns and ammunition
Keep the third world in a stagnant position
Begging for monetary aid from IMF
Who don't seem too keen to write of the third world debt
Cause they profit from holding it down
Soon there'll be no dollars, no yens, no pounds
Just madness, microchips and hi-tech war
And all because the beast wants to gain control
Of each and every mind, body, spirit and soul

Roots Manuva,"I bring you tents and girth to this homegrown range

But pain leads to gain so we dare not stagnate
We elevate to that next state, motion divine
Glisten like crystal ball and stand tall
With this knowledge and overstanding
Enterprise landing, bringing dem new brands of buff
Yes, we come proper with potency
Ain't no blood in my body, it's liquid soul in my vein
I dance on a thin line of sane and deranged
And it's all criss once I get neatly in the cipher
Chat like pickney to the piper that pied
As this natural mystic blows through the air
These lessons of life become crystal clear
Precision of my vision is ital
Separating sharks from the blessed is vital
Now I can smell a rat coming from a mile round the corner

I'll slap the bacon out your mouth, dance upon your sarnie
Rolling with Jah bredren dem, God-blessed army
How the hell you gon stop this tide from steady coming
Run and catch in tune with the elements
At speed we proceed, traction for action
Hot 125, government goons get dashed to the side
Too big to slide now, though they try to disguise
I can still recognize devilworks when I see it
Weakheart disciples keep weakheart friends
Always had a hate for what their weakhearts defend
They fiend for that crack, ain't no one to tax
We might run home and smoke a brown bag of seed
Best believe that these times is treacherous
And I know not how else I'm supposed to act
But stand close to culture roots-fi
See me getting deft with that two-step shuffle
Haggling others who for the cause
Reigning with that roots type terror
Freaking at your weakhearty era but
We build, move and prove that we don't suffer fools

So I stick around like a true friend should
And they say that some things in life can't be really mended
But only time will tell how well you and your spark prevail
Try not to implore to the stereotype factors
That they brand us with cause there's enough love to give
Oh, Lord! What's happening to me?

I need to slow down there and hold the horses

Roots Manuva,"The dark art
Bring the pensive dub
The dub is wise
Open your eye-dem

From nineteen-long time them let loose the crackin'
The god that 'nuff praise is Sterling collapse
Eyes closed, heads bowed, I hear the prayer
Proud, them must sing praise to the pound sign, sire
Hoping that they read from their pinnacle lessons
'Nuff buy scratch cards and gain jack-shit
Nothin' ain't fair in love, strife and war
Fat cats get fat while the poor stay brass
Nothin' could go on without brack-a-tiv(?)
Will you live to work or will you work to live?
Will you step to the future or dwell on the past?
For what be your fight, be it color or class?
Know if you can't ask this, the tip is me
I and I, scammin' on a fat piece of pie
And as the greed gets thicker, minds get sicker
Bloodthirsty fiends cap cocaine and liquor

These streets is thick with bad cliques looking for that raise
It don't really matter how these kids get paid
'cause we're living in the days of ill soul decay

We all got to be something and somebody
We all got to find them modes to get large
But when that love for the pound starts flooding
Every thought we hold, devil disciples collect souls
Like my man's bouncing weed ounces and everything's nice
Then in comes the crackle it bounces him tight
Triple dividends, new-found rank and position
But more reason to be cautious, much more to defend
Ends is meetin', criss skeets is greetin'
Bloods them never dreamed shit could feel so criss
While rollin' round the city in a brand-new Benz
Feelin' kinda deft 'cause there's cash to collect
Ego's on the boost now that ego needs feed
Watch the devil dance, proceed as them lick up the powder
Mans start feel like Jesse West 'cause the next plan be to
Take out the middleman and make more grand

You sticka with the cunning while the war drums are drummin'
If you don't see now, you might never see
'Cause the enemy strikes with them sick-tight ballistics
Sadistic, no error, in the guise of a friend
That was tight from way back, chewin' up the fat
Talkin' 'bout how we gonna keep stuff true
Through the thick through the thin, closer than the skin to flesh
But everybody has their price
When the beast strikes ain't no tellin' what will happen
Just when you was thinkin' you was in the same team
You catch the cold frowsy whiff of a snake in your midst
Bringin' blitz to your plans when he done shook hands
And said he's cool with his cut
Now he wants to cut my throat and take the whole lot

Hanging in the outback on tough concrete

Sin sinners, I got to talk to you about your sins
Sins on street corners, Sins in your shops
Sinny Sin Sins in your streets of yours
Sins in your eyes, sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins.

I was raised in a pentecostal Church of God
My father was the deacon, he used to stand preaching
I used to to steal collection, I used to catch a beating
Forgive me Lord, I knew not what I did
I was just a kid, trying to hustle up a quid
Feeling kinda ashamed, riding in the Church right
Bible in my hand, dressed in my sunday best.
Reach a Churchyard and I'm feeling depressed
I'm in the midst of the well-dressed, talking 'bout singing, singing
thanks and praise to the king of the Jews
And I'm all confused, 'cause I can't see the sense
Why should I turn the other cheek and get beat?
Ain't no peace without war so who am I?
The faster drives benz,  got me looking to the sky
singing soon, very soon, we gonna see the king
Soon oh, very soon, we all gonna be blamed.

Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins.

Woke up one Sunday, feeling kinda raw
I said ""Dad, I don't really want to go Church no more""
Soon as I said shit, I felt a slap to my jaw
He said ""Son, as long as your living under my roof
Your gonna heed my interpretation of the truth
And the truth is right here
It's written in this book the Holy Bible
It's the key to survival so you best heed the word""
He said, ""Do as I say, not what I do
And you'll see, goodness will follow you""
begrudgingly, I ironed my shirt, polish my shoes
Went to Chruch and I took in their far-out views
with their strange perceptions of Heaven and Hell.
To this very day I still fight down their spell
'cause all that we pray, we still stay poor
With that leaky roof dripping on the front room floor.

Sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins.

Please don't get me twisted, I'm far from a heathen
This is just a simple song of basic rhyme and reason
It's not my meaning to demean or blaspheme
But most things in the Bible ain't as plain as they seem
Can I trust King James to translate these papers?
Do I need a middle-man to link with the creator
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
Church band plays, now I'm spending my pound
Looking for a short-cut to the road to Zion
We can't fool God, but we wasting time trying
Two third of the truth is yet to be told
Two thousand years of corruption soon unfold

Sins in your eyes, sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?

And most proud to present that Cruffiton mode
And it shows that they bros done seen a few sleights
Life throws scenarios, reality bites
We in collision with the beast
Lost we religion and we can't get no peace
Idiot weakhearts want to take I for chief
Stoop to their level and we plotting cold grief
But we should know that discipline maketh the gees

Guns, bitches, hoes, crack
Death and disease, and a baseball bat
S-T-Ds that have no name
Down at the clinic with a face full'a shame
Russian Roulette with a naked flame
Dangerously slow but in the fast lane
A big nose bleed and a bag of cocaine
Just got the news about the tumour in my brain
But we don't care so we sniff it all the same
Caught my best friend sleepin' with my girlfriend, Jane
Now I'm thinkin' of a way to get them slain
Assassins for hire, they shall get paid

None of those fools shoulda got me crossed
I'm just about ready for some treachorous fame

You don't be nothin', you don't do nothin'

Run into me when you find out you got no friends
I'm sick of your pretense
A pose upon man say you big dog upon your rates
That's a lie, ay?
It's funny how life comes and scolds a dude
Certain people don't wanna learn but he shows a 'tude
And those blokes never used to go to school
Now they wanna come and push up with some playground moves
And a grown man should put down those childish things
And let the knowledge of one's self resonate within
But something in his life isn't right with him
He's caught up in the hype and it bites within
And I hear him say he closer to the pirating
There ain't no business of my own and that's his private ting
And these days I really can't be tight with him
Back in the days we used to raise, we used to blaze the wing

I told the boy that it's best that he knows his self
Take time with his study and he grows his self
Be aware of the mimicry of prankster life
There's truly few on the road that lead a gangster life
Best we motivate and give thanks for life
Or wind up paying at a costly price
Big our minds up, quick to be hypnotized
Fighting for monetary crumbs, and fable prize
Judge it, blessed we are
And people with a small mind, stretched with nah
Power with the paranoid, putrid debaters
Lonely patriots, trapped in the matrix
Blind to the sacred, 
Nature of the sufferer, to reinvent
And heal thy self with the wealth and the know-how
Power to pursue, shall get through

How many predictions come to pass this year
Did they know that North Africa would erupt
But what we know they don’t know that’s how they keep it from us
So I burn a fire from the courts to the cops
Spiritual wealth is what fills my cups
I use this hip hop to profess my love
I am not a pop star I’m a mother fucking thug
I’m a fiend for the truth, drugs
Getting lean off of liberty, pub
You see me
They let the wrong one in when they let me in
You understand what I’m saying are you hearing me
I hear what they saying with the undertones
They telling me they went to Iraq to help them grow
They’re so arrogant and so obvious
They truth pours from the ground in Fallujah
You see me

Sometimes you need to blaze up a fire
Let it be known for the record, your honor
Sometimes you need to blaze up a fire
Before the case gets settled, your honor

Let the fire blaze in various ways
Be it the road, be it the stage let the flames stay high
Demystify the myths they fly
Tell lies pon an I with their Tel lie Vision
Subliminal programmes for old mans in prison
Hold hands with the -ism that truly ain't him
Paint him taint him decimate him
Reduce to a fraction of flesh and skin
We sing riddim for the culture sculpt precisely
Devilish encryption could never subscribe we
Word power and sound moving the molecule
Burn a fool run a fool with many degrees
Peppered decree
Heat the reasons
Heat the heathens
Pagously
These streets are paved with thievery
False prophets false hopes false believery

Sometimes you need to blaze up a fire
Let it be known for the record, your honor
Sometimes you need to blaze up a fire

So lets form the battalion and stop battling for love of medallions
Covered blood laid up in a ambulance
Can't you see we're just africans with new garms on
But no hearts mannequins
While freemasons dance with the Vatican
Speech I'm so tired of imagining
So ready for riots to start happening
Ye and obama I'm not backing him
Sickening they drop bombs then sing hymns in church
Like gods gone and these devils really think they're gonna win
But they're wrong, cos I stand strong on every song and
Pardon moi if you don't know I am
The unknown man with unknown plans
Writing my future with no hands
Unplug your mind from the enemies programmes live life with benignity
Famalam stop the killing spree do you want to make money or history
Cos honestly hand on my heart no man in power's every done a thing for me
Its not a mystery its liberties blaze up a fire to the victory

Go tell the judge and the jury
They don’t know the half of the story
So if I break it down slowly
They can really see where I’m coming from
I had the spark when boy dem come
Live it down, I never done
When they showed up I never run

Rory,"The other night there was
This dream that crept inside me
I had the strangest walk
Half of a dozen legs
Space trips and ocean rifts
Concrete cracks all look the same
I saw the whole damn armada fall into file

It's not my day today

Put on your face
And if you don't like the sound then turn away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive
So give her praise
And if you can't stand the sights then look away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive

The morning I awoke
Got up and out of bed
I saw the common man
And my breath fall flat
I saw the children scurry
Following their providers
In a nauseous rush
In a dizzy hurry
Everyone of you
All working for the same
You're hopeless brainwashed drones
There's no other way!?

Put on your face
And if you don't like the sound, then turn away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive
So give her praise
And if you can't stand the sights then look away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive

[spoken verse whose lyrics are not written in CD insert]

Put on your face
And if you don't like the sound, then turn away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive
So give her praise
And if you don't like the sights then look away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive

And I take these pills that make me feel better all the time
But they hypnotize my mind
Convince me that this world's still flat
I'm spinning off my axis
Don't know when I'll touch the ground
This airplane is spinning around
And the parachutes are dancing on the wings","Hey (Parts I, II, & IV)",2006

I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinking he was a trusty tree

The sweetest flower there to find
I pricked my finger to the bone
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Rory Feek,"They were both made of leather
Both black and fraid and warm
I was brought up to respect them
Since the day that I was born
One came here for minglin’
It’s been handed down for years
The other one was ordered from
A catalogue at Sears
When my mama read to me
Well, I was well into my teens
And I thought all the other one was for
Was to hold up daddy’s jeans
Till I told a lie and learned
It had another purpose too
And behind the shed, my daddy said
Does it hurt me more than you?

‘Cause one had my daddy’s name on it
The other said King James
With love they taught us lessons
But we feared them both the same
One led us to heaven
And the other hurt like hell
But those were the days when kids were raised
With a Bible and a belt

I remember when I was twelve
I stole a dime store comic book
And how mama read what the scripture said
To take back what I took
When I refused my daddy took
My arm and said “come on”
I needed more, he knew than just Matthew
Mark, Luke and John
Sometimes it made me cry
Sometimes it made me frightened mad
I wish I’ve been raised without them
Like some other children had
But now I’m grown with kids of my own
And I know just how they felt
And though it seems to me that what the world still needs
Is a Bible and a belt

‘Cause one had my daddy’s name on it
The other said King James
With love they taught us lessons
But we feared them both the same
One led us to heaven
And the other hurt like hell

I can't believe it's true
Baby, where are you?
Baby, where are you?

In the night I'm walking in my sleep
A lonely man who just can't get no peace
Oh how I wish I just could see your face
And then I would walk the floor pace by pace

Clock on the wall
Why do you bother to chime at all
Clock on the wall
Why does this have to happen at all

In the day I'm walking on the street
Hear the sound, steps walking after me
That's just trouble, follow with me about
And that is one thing I can't do without

Clock on the wall
Why do you bother to chime at all
Spot on the wall
Did I really see it moving at all

Can't believe it's true
I can't believe it's true
I wonder where are you
I wonder where are you

And in the night I'm talking in my sleep
The things I say I just, just can't repeat
Don't need no fingerprints to know
You've got your hands on my very soul

Why do you bother to chime at all

Why does this have to happen at all

For the last time
You've sung your song
Now I'm goin' to sing mine

Out loud, so loud
Like the roaring sea

You've played around
For the last time
You've shown your claws
Now I'm goin' to show mine

Watch out, I feel about
In the night

You went around
Since the very first day
You've had your moment
Now I'm gonna have my play

So long, I'll be gone

So many restless moods play heavy in my head

Not a part of the set, 
And I'm running yet,

Is ready to watch you die

You don't want to live on the street
So you've got to sweat till you're dead

That you curse just something to cry

That you should be living in fear
When you cry out
Your friends just don't want to hear

And you dream of the day
When the great mastertime
Will call us to his side

And you watch your brothers
Shake with fear as they watch
His serpentine eye

And you can smell their fear
As they stand and curse
The fact that they're alive

Born on the wrong side of time

That some day you'll do just fine

You'll only find out what went wrong
When the sun makes us cry

Rory Gallagher,"I don't care if I get arrested
Cause tonight they'll need more than a ball and chain
I don't care just whose interested
Cause I'm comin' into town just the same

I've been feelin' alone, I've been feeling blue
I think I need a little beer or two
Be my friend, tell me where that place is
Where the whiskey flows and the dices roll till dawn?

My baby's done me wrong you must have guessed it
My heart's slow I think it must be told
I don't wanna know where east an' west is
Cause pretty soon I won't feel the cold

When I'm walking down Main Street feeling no pain
Along comes a cop he can take my name
And explain to me what a federal case is
I'm mixing the barley with the grape again

Bright city lights, make me feel alright
I'm right or wrong but tomorrow never comes
I don't care if I get investigated
And the city fathers they all black my name
I'm pretty sure that you can smell the traces
For tomorrow mornin', I'll take all the blame

I've been feeling low and feeling blue
I think I need a little whiskey or two
Good God, brother, you look like you could do with it too
That's true, tonight I'll sleep on a walking-cane

Bright city lights, make me feel alright
I'm right or wrong tomorrow never comes

Rory Gallagher,"I want to plant a star on the sky 
One you can find at the end of the night 
I want to climb a ladder to space 
And leave without trace

In some other space

And leave it behind stay by my side

Rory Gallagher,"In the flinty light, it's midnight 
And stars collide. 
Shadows run, in full flight 
To run, seek and hide. 
I'm still not sure what part I play 
In this shadow play, this shadow play. 

In the half light, on this mad night 
I hear a voice in time. 
Well, I look back, see a half-smile 
Then it's gone from sight. 
Won't you tell me how I can find my way 
In this shadow play, this shadow play. 

Sounds come crashing 
And I hear laughing 
All those lights just blaze away. 
I feel a little strange inside 
A little bit of Jekyll, a little Mr. Hyde. 

Sounds come crashing 
Can I hear laughing? 
All those lights just blaze away. 
I feel a little strange inside 
A little Dr. Jekyll, a little Mr. Hyde. 

Thoughts run wild, free as a child 
Into the night. 
Across the screen a thin beam 
Of magic light. 
Things they just don't look the same 
In this shadow play, this shadow play 
Shadow play, shadow play. 
I can't run away from this shadow play",Shadow Play [Live],2011
Rory O'Neil,"Cold night, strange dreams 
Memory stuck like glue
Her face, her voice
Sail across the seas with you
Can you hear all the angels?

When you feel like you're out there on your own
Know there is someone watching over you
When out at sea, feels love can let go
Oh sailor, we will blow the wind right
But if you die out there, tearing you into two
I hope you know that you could sail right on
I hope you know you got the ocean blue

No sound worse than silence 
A curse that grows 
Big words kept in
Whispers of dreams untold
Just don't fight all the angels

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

Ros Stephen,"I used to visit all the very gay places,
Those come-what-may places,
Where one relaxes on the axis,
Of the wheel of life,
To get the feel of life,
From jazz and cocktails.

The gals (girls) I knew had sad and sullen gray faces,
With distant gay traces,
That used to be there.
You could see where,
They'd been washed away,
By too many through the day.
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along,
With your siren song,
To tempt me to madness.
I thought for awhile,
That your poignant smile,
Was tinged with the sadness,
Of a great love for me.
I guess (Ah, yes,) I was wrong.
Again, I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again.
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.

A week in Paris might (will) ease the bite of it.
All I care is to smile in spite of it.
I'll forget you I will,
While yet you are still,
Burning inside my brain.

Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life,
In some small dive.

And there I'll be,
While I rot with the rest,
Of those whose lives are lonely, too.

Waiting until tomorrow
Dreams of what could be
Come close to me, timidly

And you're one of the minor players
Look for what you lost
For days to come, harbour some
Let your spirit start the fight
At that time: round about midnight

Every day's going to bring some sad times
Every day's going to bring some glad times
So take what you can of the glad times
Don't measure your pleasure
In nickels and dimes

Look back on today and you'll know

What might at night have their day
Let your eyes put out their light

Rosa León,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17,2006
Rosa López,"Vuelven a mí
Recuerdos que no saben dónde ir 
Tal vez otro momento traiga amor 
Y vuelva a creer, y vuelva a creer 

Ya me cansé
De tantas tardes en soledad 
Ya nada de eso importa sin fingir 
Yo quiero vivir, yo quiero vivir 

Condeno otra vez 
Mentiras y traiciones del ayer 
Supero ya mi miedo y gritaré
Al fin pienso en mí
Al fin pienso an mí

Supe entrenar
Los lomos de mi espalda y tirar 
Tantas historias que dan miedo hablar 
Y no me escapé, yo no me escapé

Fiera de mar 
Catástrofe en el cielo con mi dios 
Contando aquellos pasos de terror
Ya no puedo más, ya no puedo más 

Condeno otra vez 
Mentiras y traiciones del ayer 
Supero ya mi miedo y gritaré
Al fin pienso en mí
Al fin pienso en mí 

Arranco mi ropa y grito sin voz
Sin darte cuenta tú, tú me has hecho mejor 
Empiezo de nuevo, trascribo mi historia 

Comienzo a vivir
Cociendo cada parte de mi piel 
Curando mis heridas gritaré 
Al fin pienso en mí

Sei que não vai dar em nada
Seus segredos sei de cór
Já conheço as pedras do caminho
E sei também que ali sozinho
Eu vou ficar, tanto pior
O que é que eu posso contra o encanto
Desse amor que eu nego tanto
Evito tanto
E que no entanto
Volta sempre a enfeitiçar
Com seus mesmos tristes velhos fatos
Que num álbum de retrato
Eu teimo em colecionar

Lá vou eu de novo como um tolo
Procurar o desconsolo
Que cansei de conhecer
Novos dias tristes, noites claras
Versos, cartas, minha cara
Ainda volto a lhe escrever
Pra lhe dizer que isso é pecado
Eu trago o peito tão marcado
De lembranças do passado
E você sabe a razão

After it brought my lover near
