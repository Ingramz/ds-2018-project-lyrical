Adelitas Way,"I knew I should have savored every moment
I wish I would have grabbed tight and just hold in

I know, I know everything's wrong
Let go, let go, now I'm gone

When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out (x2)

I know I should have cherished every second
I step back, step back to another perspective
And in my mind, my mind I know it's been long
It's a feeling you've got, you're feeling so cold

When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out (x2)

I don't want to feel like this will never be over
And I don't want to sit and think about what's going wrong
I don't want to feel like this will never be over
Cause it feels like I've been falling for so damn long

When it all falls down
And you know
There's no way that you can get out (x2)

(All falls down
And you know
There's no way you can get out) 

When it all falls down",All Falls Down,2009
Adelitas Way,"I've got a lot that's on my mind today
But every man got a story to tell
My brother watched his life go down the drain
His addiction took control of him
Every time I see my brother look at me
I turn my head, to me he's dead

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again
It's everything that he ever dreamed
Says things he doesn't mean
But I'm going on again

Please my mother don't cry today
I know it's hard cause he's your first born son
Don't blame yourself for the decisions made
I think it's time, we just let him go

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again
It's everything that he ever dreamed
Says things he doesn't mean
But I'm going on again

All the times you lie
Tell me that you changed
But you never did
You just walked away
It always stays the same
Every time you cried
And you felt afraid
Look at what you did
Now just walk away
You'll never change

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again

So much pressure, so much pain
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
But I'm going on again
It's everything that he ever dreamed
Says things he doesn't mean
But I'm going on again",Brother,2009
Adelitas Way,"As you walk my way
Do you see my face
Sad behind a smile
Fake it for awhile
Tell me what should I do?

Can I get closer to you
Tell me the truth
Can I get an answer from you
Show me a sign
Here I stand with my heart in my hands
And all I do
To get closer to you

As I stand alone
Sinking like a stone
You can save me now
I can't live without
Tell me what should I do?

Can I get closer to you
Tell me the truth
Can I get an answer from you
Show me a sign
Here I stand with my heart in my hands
And all I do
To get closer to you

If you walked my way
Would you see my face?

Can I get closer to you
Tell me the truth
Can I get an answer from you
Show me a sign
Here I stand with my heart in my hands
And all I do
To get closer to you

To get closer to you
And all I do
To get closer to you
And all I do
To get closer to you
And all I do",Closer to You,2009
Adelitas Way,"I like it when you're watching me
You grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you look at me
You still say please
And the way you can't say no

It's late at night she's at my window
(I'm a fool)
She's drunk again and wants to take it out on me
(You know you do)
She never says goodbye
But what we did plays in my mind
All over you

I like it when you're watching me
You grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
You still say please
And the way you can't say no
You take me places I've never been
When I keep on falling
You show me things that I've never seen
My dirty little thing

The sun is up she's out my window
(now you're gone)
The sky will fall and I know she'll be back again
(I know you will)
She takes control of me
And always gives me what I need
Again and again

I like it when you're watching me
You grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
You still say please
And the way you can't say no
You take me places I've never been
When I keep on falling
You show me things that I've never seen
My dirty little thing

Tie me up and take control
I know you like what's going on
I wanna see how far you'll go
I like when you strip me down
You wear me out
You take me to another place like no one else

I like it when you're watching me
You grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
You still say please
And the way you can't say no

Adelitas Way,"When I first met you got a feeling that I'll never forget
An animal attraction I know
We'd be bad together but the make up sex as good as it gets
And I just want to say to you

Every time that I hate you
I love you
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can't let you go
And I just want to get enough
Every time that I hate you
I love you
You're the part of the pain that I love too
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can see right through
You love to hate me too (You love to hate me too)

Every time we fight I feel like breaking up but I know I can't
No one ever gets me like this
I learned a lesson it's a losing battle a war I can't win
And now I got to say to you

Every time that I hate you
I love you
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you
It doesn't matter what you're saying

All these almost breakups
You love to hate me too
Are always worth the make ups
And if we make it through
I just want to say to you

I love you
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you

Adelitas Way,"I'm feeling disillusioned
And I can't stop thinking about you now
Your sex is so diluted
And your love will put me in the ground
Until you take it away
Turn all this love into hate
And then you leave me here dying

You're heartless stop this
Give me just a little bit
I could be your star
Let me take a hit of it
Give me just a little bit
I could be your lie today

This power's an illusion
You can't stop thinking 'bout me now
I let you think I'm losing this time

It's an addiction to you
But it's a habit I choose
I even like when you're lying

Adelitas Way,"I'm all alone
You're far away
Never learned from my mistakes
I should have known
Just what to say
To make you want to stay
You were always the one giving
I was always there to take it
Take your heart and break it
Oh

And I'll never make it without you
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
I'm making my last stand
It took a moment to say
It wasn't you it was me
I couldn't let you in
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again

Miss you the most when I sleep
Turning nightmares into dreams
Can't lose hope
It's killing me
(killing me)
I'm the one who made you leave
But if I just take a chance now
Open up and finally reach out
(reach out)
Can I save it all somehow
Oh

And I'll never make it without you
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
I'm making my last stand
It took a moment to say
It wasn't you it was me
I couldn't let you in
Now I'm ashamed I pushed you away from me
Now I'm afraid it's too late to save again

I'm all alone
You're far away
I finally found the words to say
Oh
And I'll never make it without you
(sorry for the way I shut you out)
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
(sorry for the way)
I'll make it my last stand

It was me

Adelitas Way,"So take that you
You hate it
A city that seems so jaded
I can't
I can't end up like that
It's all about what you drive
Who you know
In a second it'll swallow you whole
And so fast
Just like that
You're way off track
To all you
Who want to
You want to it just ain't worth it
To all you
Who need to
You need to know

I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me
I've finally had enough of what you say
Now you're talking tough cause you back stabbed me
You're my derailment

So sick and so shameless
I swore I'd never start by saying
Do you know
You know who I am
It's not about what you drive
Who you know
Cause when it's gone
You'll be standing alone
And so fast
Just like that
You can't go back
To all you
Who want to
You want to it just ain't worth it
To all you
Who need to
You need to know

I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me

You're my derailment

It's funny how you lie and try to wreck me
It's funny how you're falling on your face
I'm never going to let you disrespect me
You're my derailment
The train is off the tracks
I'm not looking back

I don't give a fuck that you can't stand me
I've finally had enough of what you say
Now you're talking tough cause you back stabbed me
You're my derailment

It's funny how you lie and try to wreck me
It's funny how you're falling on your face
I'm never going to let you disrespect me
You're my derailment
Where do we go from here

I've got the remedy
To burn your memories

Come on don't be shy
I wanna make you go down down

I can make you scream
How I live my life when I have no choice
I see it in your eyes you're crazy
Just scream
How it feels inside

Adelitas Way,"I saw you get it when you wanted it then
I gave it to you when you wanted it now
I know you're feeling that it's close to the end
Staring at me with your back on the ground

I know your world is in my hands
You know I pull the strings
I like to see how tall you stand
'Cause if I wanted I could take it away

Get laid out or I'm gonna lay you out
Stay down or I'm gonna keep you down
I want it to break, I want it to burn
I wanna bury you until it hurts
And I take, I don't ask
This breath will be your last
Do you feel the collapse?

You feel the pressure as I'm pulling you in
You're crumbling under the weight of the game
Before you let it all just go to your head
Now you're praying that you're walking away

You know your world is in my hands
You know I pull the strings

We make the perfect kind of misery
I help you, you help me
Become the one I swore I'd never be
The one that I don't ever wanna be

I like the way you won't apologize
I like the way you just demoralize
I like the way you always roll your eyes
Someone as perfect as you is hard to criticize

Suppress this, this hatred
I stand beside you while you soak it in
Spit on me, I taste it
I love you more and you just fake it
I want you more and you just faked it

You've taken me down this road before
Something's missing
Too many times you've let me know
I am trying to make it the way it used to be

If I gave you the ocean
You would ask for the sun
But if I gave you that sunlight
You would say it's not what you want
And I give, and I give, and I give
But I don't give up
There was a time
When my best was good enough

Sometimes I wish I could walk away and not think twice
I can't get past the thought of you in someone else's life
Can I keep you if I try?
Can I make it right?

If I gave you the ocean
You would ask for the sun
But if I gave you that sunlight
You would say it's not what you want
And I give, and I give, and I give

And I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill, I take another hit
So let's do it again
I know you lie to hurt me
Say that I'm not worthy
I pop another pill, I take another hit
Let's do it again

And now we go our separate ways
In a story that seems so sad
Am I a distant memory
Like a stranger you never even met

So let's do it again

Tempted and there's nothing inside

And all the things I always thought that we'd do
But it was never enough

Why you don't love me now
So why'd you tear me down
I'm faceless in the crowd
So tell me is this real
'Cause I can't help but feel
I'm heading for heart-ache

Like you've never been kissed
Like a picture you paint
Will I ever be missed
Would you stay if I told you my love wouldn't change
If your hair turns grey
If you gain a little weight

Is it the end of the picture or is it just the point where you give in?

How could any angels survive?
Everything has turned pitch black...
As we wait for a revolution to arrive

It's been long enough and every time I mend, you are there for me to bend. 
Is it the beginning of the second act only when you heal these torn and broken hearts. 
Blood is on this microphone, while I learn the art of speaking through my soul, 
Trying to save you from your fall from grace. I think I'm finally in love, 
And that's one thing I'll never let go of.

The back of my hand
You drew a heart
And some tiny dots

And a spiral
Which reminded me
Of the Milky Way
And it made me think

If our galaxy
And Andromeda
Felt like you and me
Were like the way we are

They couldn't feel as vast
And if they join
At six billion lives per second
And they danced around

Linking spiral arms
As they'd spin
Spin through infinity
They couldn't feel as vast
As I feel now

Galactic tectonic shifts
In my chest and behind my eyes
And yet the smallest vibration
Like the touch of your pen
Makes my hair makes
My hair stand on end

And a spiral
Which together spell
I want you in electricity

Else we'll just roll around

To find the reasons for life etched between the distant suns
And the zodiac in blues, to the wealth of all the ones we knew

So it's hard to explain how I'm so sure

We drift on oblivious

They're more than tiny stars

I wore out my telescope
And I nearly gave up hope
Of finding anything

Discovery
Was an accidental thing
A reflection slipping in
To the corner of my eye

I saw you and moon
And hope flooded through me
I just needed proof

I saw you and moon
I had to get closer
For a look

Alone and
A universe away
I was drawn to make my way
To where the living are

My eyelids
Filled with hypnogogic shapes
And my body wracked with shakes
I traveled light years
In heart beats

I saw you and moon
Dancing together against dark blue
I saw you and moon
I never felt lonely 'til I saw you

Been making
Music
With instruments
Of science

Distracted
And happy
And so self
Reliant

Then I saw you and moon
And hope flooded through me
And I chased proof

But I left, I left too soon
'Cause light is a liar
And so are you

I saw you and moon
But the image was older
Than the truth
When I arrived
I found only tombs

'Cause light is a liar
Telling old truths
Having had something to aim for
Has left me lost

And everything that my mom said made me mad
And everything that my dad said made me sad

Relating to the rawness of a fucking lost kid
Trying so hard to become just like me

Every time I swear, even when it comes to my hair
It seems like you don't have the time to relate to my kind

Adestria,"Denial surrounds a naive boy, as he plays in the field.
Precious time escapes him, ignorant to what is real.
There's a thief in the shadows waiting to breed.
To take away what is his, to take from him what he needs.
""Now my son, be strong (along the path of life)."" 
In his flesh these words have carried on.
She worries for him, to keep him calm. 
Her love runs through forever on, forever true.
He fights the truth he has within.
Refuses to let the sea of reason in.
A father grows numb, his weakness he dare not show.
A child robbed of love, too young to know.
The chasm grows too wide as they struggle to save a precious life for another day.
She sat through nights, and held him tight, thankful for the years.
Knowing the end was in sight accepting what she'd feared.
""Now my son, be strong (along the path of life)."" 
In his flesh these words have carried on.
She worries for him, to keep him calm. 
Her love runs through forever on, forever true.
As time runs out, everything he never said, 
Every chance he never took, plays over in his head.
And he screamed at the sky!
The body of a woman that he still loves, lays lifeless before his eyes.
A hollow vessel at rest, opens up to the skies.
Does death give way to peace, or just oblivion?

This is our anthem. This is our song!
We're all we've got left, so stand up, so stand up, against everything.
You've gotta fight to see another day.
If this is hell than I don't want to see those pearly gates,
because the life I live is the life I love and I wouldn't have it any other way.
And if I stand alone to face the jaws of death, 
then I'll make sure that he earns this soul and I'll scream my name until my final breath.
You'll reach a point where it seems like the only option is letting go,
with uncertainty above, and the fires down below!
Some will tell you the path you walk ends with you alone.
Pay no attention, this is a life they'll never know.

If we don't have each other, then we don't have anything.
My bones, come hell or high water, still need saving from a sinking ship.
You refuse to let me fade, put me back together. We're alive. Let's destroy it.
Fight to survive!
These are more than words, more than a song that we sing. 
For those who stand together this life means everything.
Don't pray that it gets better, these storm won't go away. 
You've gotta fight, you've gotta fight, fight to see another day!
If you feel the same, if you feel alone, then this can be a place we call our own.
If you feel the same, abandoned and judged, then leave it all behind and sing with us.

Y sientes que todo se te valora
Sabes que no habrá nada igual
Dicen que el amor ya no está de moda
Que lo que nos hicimos se evapora
Pero tú sabes que a mí no me importa
Así que déjate llevar

Como si fuéramos como las olas
Navegaremos bajo aquella aurora
Sé que yo te haré feliz y cuidaré de ti
Yo nunca dejaré que tú estés sola

Tú eres mi consentida, la diva de mi vida
La delincuente que ha robado toda el alma mía
Llenando mi corazón, cada día con su amor
Y aunque no me cuenta, yo sé lo que siente
Vamo a navegar a Marte donde nadie nos encuentre
Lo suficiente, bien precisamente
Yo voy a mostrarme como el agua transparente
Yo seré tu compañero a tu lado un prisionero
Bajo el cielo azul en busca de ese amor que nos tenemos
Quiere que le cante, quiere que le baile
Conmigo ella quiere estar
Quiere que la mime, quiere que la cuide
Sólo yo la voy a amar

Como si fuéramos como las olas
Navegaremos bajo aquella aurora
Sé que yo te haré feliz y cuidaré de ti
Yo nunca dejaré que tú estés sola

Yeah Adexe & Nau
Navegando contigo
Ola tras ola

Sé que quiere estar conmigo navegando a su destino
Como la brisa y el mar acariciando su camino
Ella es una flor en el jardín de mis sueños
Soy su principito y su ranita en un cuento
Es mi bebé, la cuidaré
Viajando por el mundo una y otra vez
África, América, la India tal vez
Donde quiera que yo vaya, te llevaré

Adi Braun,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,2003
Adi Braun,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Goodness knows

Adi Braun,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,2006
Adi Braun,"You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
Cause you do something to me
That nobody else could do

You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You got the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
Cause you do something to me
That nobody else can do
That no one else in the world can do",You Do Something to Me,2006
Adi Braun,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",That Old Devil Moon,2008
Adi Yeshaya,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young,
Adicta,"A ver

De mis ansias

El día que nació 
En tu boca
De un nuevo temporal

Adie,"It's finally calming down
I've found the motion of life that spins around
Grows dim as I enter in
A trail of tears sing Your embrace
The scars of death and life we face
But I know, I'll be with You soon

And when it's over, when it's over
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel Your open arms take hold of me
And when it's over, when it's over
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands
And see the beauty of what You have planned

Revealing grace's final call
I can't comprehend at all
My hope will be completed
Seeing You with eyes unveiled
Knowing without You I'd have failed
I'll wait, come soon, I'm waiting

And when it's over, when it's over
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel Your open arms take hold of me
And when it's over, when it's over
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands
And see the beauty of what You have planned

My anticipation turns into desperation
When I think of when I will be with You, my Jesus

When it's over and when it's over
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel Your open arms take hold of me
And when it's over, when it's over
I'll finally touch Your wounded hands
And see the beauty of what You have planned

And when it's over, when it's over
I'll finally fall down at Your feet
And feel Your open arms take hold of me

Hear You speak
Won't let go
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray

Got every reason to be here again
Father's love that draws me in
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

One more day and it's not the same
Your spirit calls my heart to sing
Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again
Where would my soul be without Your Son
Gave His life to save the earth
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me

All I need is You

And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

My loneliest evening 
Mail it today 
If it's only to say 
That you're leaving me 
Monday morning, sitting in the sun 
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come 

Tuesday, never got a word 
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign 
Drank half a bottle of iodine 
Friday, woe is me 
Gonna hang my body from the highest tree

But cant knock her and I can be a freak until the day
Until the dawn
Baby don't front when its time to bring the bomb
I'll make you feel it in your tummy
Word is bond ill have ya walking funny
Talk is cheap just give me a beep
We can peep boy you'll get freaked
Tell ya what baby beep
Lets come next week
Ill make ya reach your peak yeah

[Chorus: x2]

Nasty my type like it
Since its Adina you I might bite it
Mad excited pop the G to peep inside it
Let and divide it
Don't play the road way
So watch rat while we foreplay
And pour more alezae
Now your neck make ya crack let
Could sweat all day
Stuff the Garcia
With dar tree
The guard see
While our positions harshly
I throw it in you to the end boo
Knees to chest and next is next to flex

[Chorus]",Next Experience,1997
Adina Howard,"Ooh, yeah, yeah, what's love got to do
Warren G rap for me, yeah, mmm

When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place
There's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face
You want to live fat off of my sack
You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act
'Cause back before '92 and '93
You didn't give a damn about Warren G
But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's
All of a sudden you on my N.U.T's
Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop
'Cause money makes the world
Go 'round and the panties drop
I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure
I just want to dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure
Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep
Thought you was TLC, you had to creep
You say you had love, I said you bullshit
It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it

What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines
Before I made beats, I was down to grind
Back then, every single homey had my back
Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack
But I'm the same brother day in and day out
And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out in a casket
It's drastic 'cause homies is plastic
Break 'em off some bread
They want the whole damn basket
If you's a true homey, you would wish me well
Not plot to make a brother fail, jealous as hell
We used to get the same riches
Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches 
Which is not a surprise, my eyes peep game
211's, 187's it's all the same
It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip
Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips

What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

Now for these labels tellin' fables
Makin' the fucked-up deals under the tables
You think that you smart, but fool, I'm the smartest
You canÂ´t make no money if you can't keep an artist
Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf
Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself
I know how it goes, treat an artist like a ho'
Fly cars, gold, clothes, but no dough
Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine
Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime
'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck
You bend over for the label, and you will get fucked
Like how we run up in a trick, and then you're through
The record label do the same shit to you
90% business, 10% show
Ain't no love in this game 'cause it's all about the dough

What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

One wasn't without the other (one wasn't without the other)
It was something (it was something)
And it took a wrong turn
I ended up on the freeway

I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80

I got this feeling that I just can't shake
And I can't focus I can't even concentrate
Where my baby been all day long
Last time we spoke said he was on his way home
I tried to tell myself don't lose it don't jump to no conclusions
But what could he be doing
I'm headed for the door, grab my car keys
Now I'm on the freeway doin 80

I'm hoping that I'm wrong ain't nothings going on
I got this premonition womans intuition
If nothings going on won't you pick up the phone
And I gotta know so I gotta go

I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80

As I get closer I start to question what I'm doing
I must be wrong could I be wrong am I just foolish
He gotta know I ain't the type of girl to fool with
And god I hope I don't run up and see some bullshit
I tried to tell myself don't lose it just turn up the music
But what could he be doing oh
Damn he got me dippin
Don't wanna get a ticket
But I gotta know

I'm hoping that I'm wrong ain't nothings going on
I got this premonition womans intuition
If nothings going on won't you pick up the phone
And I gotta know so I gotta go

I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80

I know he's home
His lights is on
Who's car is in the driveway
He ain't alone
I walked up on the porch
Knock knock knock (Who is it)
He won't open the door
Knock knock knock
Baby girl I know its you
But I can't open up this door
Cause if I do you'll know the truth and won't love me no more
Baby say no more open up the door
He opened the door
It was my best friend

Comme le sang qui coule qui circule dans tes veines

Pas besoin d'aller à l'église pour me confier à lui
Pas d'une tierce personne

Où il y a tout plein de petites Diam's
Y'a de la rage dans les blocs, po po
Y'a des gosses dans les tops, po po

Admiral Fallow,"Make a cup with your hands to take a drink
In the same way that your father did
And throw a stone upon the river's lid
Watch the circles take you home

Blow the smoke and watch it leave your lungs
And high or not, think of what you've done
Have you not considered life beneath the thumb?
Or flying solo in your home?

'Cause sometimes it's who, not what you do
Just because your father did doesn't mean that you should too
I don't want to lose you
Don't go away from here

It's that sinking feeling of being alone
And it's the way it makes you screech
And pulls the skin off your bones
And I can't help but think, as I pick my mouth off the floor,
Will you still know me in a year?

Don't you think about your actions?
Counter-weight dire reactions?
Zero soul, you're a loser's son
But don't you go away from here

Your mind's a mine-field in a minor way
Don't just fall in like some mindless stray
""We're your friends, you see"" is what they say
Don't you go away from here

Your own miniature firework display for one

It's the beetle in the box that shakes in your hands

They're mapped in the gaps and the spaces between
The worry of bearing the ghost in the machine

I eat your words and you mark my mistakes
We set the dictionary up to fail
The work of poets is a vapour we exhale it's gone

Fleeting fondness is a flicker in your frown
Spilling out in adjectives and nouns
A mess of letters once it's chewed and swallowed down all gone

There, a crack from behind from some cat with a death wish

To the homeless steel toe capped itch

The sight of my future bout rids me of red mist

Strength in numbers and width like two bears on a mouse
I give a thought to the organ that beats in my mouth
And say balls to a hurricane
I'll toast to my health

It's the saving of face
It's the courage to turn your back on the way you were raised

I bruised my heels, I bruised my heels!
And was confused as to how I got here
Take your scar, smirk style
Vocal rapier and foil
And bury it with yourself and your pride
Down the nearest uncovered manhole

Moi je baise le rap comme Bob Marley a enculé le reggae demande à Ziggy
Tu fais boogie boogie dans ton baggy popo Peggy
Nique sa mère l'Empire State Building
Des bastos pleines de protéines tu fais du body building
J'ai glissé de l'harissa ? dans ton mac morny
Le carnaval de Londres en 4x4 à cinquante mille livres sterlings
C'est pas une?on me file un beau string, tout le monde dans le ring
Même en jogging j'ai la cote plus que toi en smoking
Bombers, y paraît que tu mets des pampers
Depuis que je suis revenu je rap peut-être mais mon album sort comme un détenu
Je domine la France comme le?
Quitte à ce que mon égal cède la oual ne fait pas le moine
Laisse pousser les cheveux même

Tant que tu chanteras comme une pédale tu feras pas le Rohffrap

On chante pas pour serrer des femmes, notre style est infâme

Sur les excréments de BNC
Les rappeurs souffrent de problèmes de personnalité
Vas-y raccroche ton hardcore n'a pas de tonalité
Placard rap, braque à rap, calamité
Lâche-moi la grappe, moi je te braque?pas l'amitié
C'est manier les mots par les?de flingues

Like satelllites, we'll always be there
I am the sun, you are the moon
We are the hope they'll always see there

It's true
I burn for you
This time each day
We meet this way
To share the things we've got to say

Our souls entwine and share the dream
We both believe we can fly anywhere

[Chorus]",Sun & Moon,1998
Admiral Twin,"Once upon a time
I was rattling around
Like a songbird that you prized
But it never made a sound

Someone told me not to come
They told me not to look
But you know I never take advice
And one time is all it took

I thought hey, I'd treat you like an aeroplane
I'd feed you clouds and vapor trails
We'd go for walks on Everest
We would sleep underneath
The watchful eye of the crescent moon

It might seem ludicrous
I know it sounds cliché
But when she walks into the room
She brings a brighter day

Can't help but watch her every move
While I pretend to look away
Smitten, bound and gagged
But if I got the chance I'd say

I'd say, ""Hey, I'll treat you like an aeroplane""
I'll catch you like a falling star
I'll be your hero astronaut
And we'll sleep underneath
The waterfall of the Milky Way

But if I wait a little while
I might find the nerve
To find the words to say to her
I find the timing's right
To wait a little while, a little while

Perfect is a number
That you're not allowed to say
So when she put me on the spot
I quickly coined a phrase

I said, ""Hey, I'll treat you like an aeroplane""
I'll feed you clouds and vapor trails
We'll go for walks on Everest
And we'll sleep underneath the waterfall
Yeah, we'll sleep underneath
The watchful eye of the crescent moon.

Just another day
It's just another day

A critical word's a betrayal
But the judge won't state my crime
When I find myself on trial
I always end up doing time

Another day on the track
Another day on my back

The sky looks blue
And all but I'm tied to the track
She pretends that
She can't hear me falling apart

I'm rattling 'round through your bones

Outside your window-pane
There's sounds and city lights
But all your sight is gleaned
On something else

And it's intangible, this feeling in your soul
Some strange, enchanted inspiration
You are the special one
Blessed imperial, your world is out of sight
And it's intangible, this feeling in your soul

Blink once if you want to be near me
Twice if you'd rather I live in Hell

""A healthy baby boy""
October 4th of 1925

His parents had a plan
He'd live a better life
Be a man of means
Who knows, he might go really far

And then the days slipped by
And turned into years
And many pages turned in the story of his life

Took a detour through a war
Cast a shadow across his soul
October 4th of 1944

Stories he would never tell
So he had to write them down to keep them captive
On Veteran's Day he pulls them out
It's a cleansing of the soul and a freeing of his mind

He didn't change the world
But he eventually met a girl
Their child would be his only legacy

And so he cried to God
""It's not what I had planned
And there's one more thing
I'll never understand

How did the days slip by
When did they turn into years?""
How many pages did you get for the story of your life?

Call it what you will, name it tragedy
But in the end he just looks back and smiles
It's just his life

You opened your mouth but before you could speak

I said no, I really, don't think, I want to know
I really, don't think, I want to go that far, now
Let's just stay right where we are now
Live, well enough, alone

I squint at the road but I can still see
Windshield reflections, you're staring at me
You've something to say, that I don't want to hear
And it gets hard to drive, when I'm covering my ears

So, I say no, I really, don't think, I want to know
I really, don't think, I want to go that far down
I'd rather stay uninvolved now

These fevered confessions, frighten me and though you're my friend
I swear, if you don't stop soon, it's a long walk home again

I wanted to hear the secrets you keep?

When I hit the brakes

Slowdown
Before it gets away
Slowdown
You've got to set aside
Some time to get it right

Sometimes you'll find
That even fools can offer wisdom
In their views of the world
And it's gold

You
Your life is in the fastlane
You need to take it easy
You really need to find
A way to slow it down

Slowdown
You've got to live for something
Slowdown
Before it gets away
Slowdown
You've got to set aside
Some time to get it right

Sometimes you'll find
That even fools can offer
Wisdom in their views
Of the world...

You've got to live for something

Before it gets away

Before it gets away

Adolescent's Orquesta,"No finjas que ya lo se todo soy mayor que tu 
Y no pienses que con eso voy a atarme a tus sentimientos 
Es tu primera vez ya me di cuenta 
Ya no llores, ya no temas 
Eso no es todo en el amor 
Tranquila que aqu?? estoy yo. 

Tampoco pienses que soy como aquel que burl?? tu inocencia 
S?? que siempre lastimo, no hablemos m??s del tema 
Pero algo aqu?? fall??, y para eso estoy yo 
Para hablarte del amor 

Ahora entr??gate 
Si lloro o tiemblo es por ti amor 
Es que Dios me mand?? para ti 
Adorarte para toda la vida 
Si??nteme 
Soy el hombre que muere contigo amor 
Te respeta y naci?? para ti 
Ni??a de mi vida. 

Soy como aquel que pis?? la rosa y crey?? que se marchit?? 
Y yo aqu?? afuera escondido para levantarte 
Te amar?? y cuidar??, y te proteger?? 
Y es que hasta mi vida te doy 

Y ahora entr??gate 
Si lloro o tiemblo es por ti amor 
Es que Dios me mand?? para ti 
Adorarte para toda la vida 
Si??nteme 
Soy el hombre que muere contigo amor 
Yo si te amo y vivo por ti 
Mi linda querida. 

(No me importa) 
Ya no llores no me importa tu pasado 
(Si yo te amo) 
Como yo me di cuenta tan tarde 
Algo que Dios me ha mandado 
(No me importa) 
Te ense??are que eso no es todo en el amor 
(Si yo te amo) 
Tu sentimiento aqu?? por dentro y nada hab??a pasado 
(No me importa) 
Para, somos una sola persona 
(Si yo te amo) 
Si la vida tiene tantas cosas bellas. 

No llores ni??a 
Tu sientes que se te acaba la vida 
No tienes la culpa de enamorarte 
Y que hayan jugado con tus sentimientos 
R??e mi vida 
Que ahora empieza la nueva vida que nos espera 
R??e 

Como evitarlo t?? corres por mis venas 
(As?? yo te amo) 
Eres la rosa mas bella mi alma es toda tuya 
(No me importa) 
Olv??dalo, de verdad te lo pido 
(Si yo te amo) 
Es que yo soy tuyo cuerpo y alma

Och en skog av gröna granar
Jag vill ha snötyngda hus
Tusentals ljus
Kulörta kulor I drivor
Bjällerklang
Som ackompangemang
På alla julens skivor

Jag vill ha mer jul 

Ge mig en svårknäckt nöt
Sötare gröt
Djupare dopp I grytan
Glittrigare glim
Och grötigare rim
Och mer Arne Weise I rutan
Jag vill ha rymligare säck
Segare knäck
Fetare fläsk från grisen
Krimsigare krams
Längre långdans
Och raskare räv på isen

Jag vill ha mer jul 

Jag vill ha mer, mer
Ge mig mer, mer

These niggas holdin the piece, cock the hammer, heard it click
Gun held in my hand, but the glock it didn't spit
Niggas takin my shit, I ran my clothes and my shoes
??? robbin a nigga, kill his ass if he move
But why'all ain't killin Lavell, without a fight tonight

Chicken wings and musket dimes

Swoop his ass up out his vines

Maybe why'all can check it like this here, check it
Let me show why'all trill, can a brother get ill
What's the deal if I still feel 
like I won't kill 'cause I just can't pay my bills
And my got damn girl won't take her pills
Make a nigga want to play the field, pray for real
Hopin all my partners stay for real
Can you say boy Crooked Lettaz ain't for real?
'Cause we makin that shit that the playas feel
You done made a deal, 'cause ya tape don't hit
Talk that talk, and ya boy can't spit
Ain't no bigger than a small time

Stick, move, can't, lose, do them shows, pay them dues

The preacher's Bible said there's no depiction of Christ
But then they lie to a brother, now my mind ain't right
'Cause if God is white, and black folks ain't shit
But they know that he wasn't, but they couldn't run the risk
Of their town praisin one who looked more like ???
They rather play in my mind and send us all to hell
But I'm here to tell the truth, fuck the myths and the lies

Adonis,"[Chorus]
I've been trying so hard, 
To erase the scars, 
Of living this life, 
On the boulevard.
(Oh on the boulevard)

Every morning Kenny wake up 'bout five am, 
And jog about seven miles before class start. 
Had dreams of being the next superstar, 
Like that boy who sang Bo'. 
Kenny's ambition was crazy, 
In his heart he was determined to get it, 
So he stuck wit' to it. 
Six days out the week Kenny hit the track, 
With his goals set high, he ain't turning back. 
Lost one too many friends over guns and crack. 
Kenny put it in his mind there's something better then that. 
His daddy called him flypaper the way he stuck to the track,
His momma said ""it's your time baby you can't turn back."" 
And through all the blood, sweat, and the tears, 
Kenny promised the fan for forty years 
To come, got to get it. 
He shall prosper, 
Jumping hurdles in life 'til the next one pop up.

[Chorus]

Every morning Kenny wake up at nine am, 
Hit the trap house and stay there til its five am. 
I call that trappin' pages. 
He always holdin his dick, always busting off, 
But I don't call that masturbation. 
He all about heart. 
And you will never hear ""Oh my god they killed Kenny"", 
Bitch this ain't South Park. 
This the dirty mittens scurvy conditions, 
Workers is stealin', stealers is workin'. 
You only as real as the nigga you murdered. 
Bullets fly 'til your chest leak, 
Treat you like you a crownless chess piece. 
Middle finger never up, that's a substituted waste. 
Why would he do that when can just tell you niggas ""Fuck You"" to your face? 
He could fill up y'all with Philly's boulevard bully, 
To pull your card with no regards for the laws, wearing a hoodie. 
Police on his trail, he toss the bird, 
Roll his window down like ""Can I help you office-err?""

I've been hustlin' for so long.
The streets just won't leave me alone.
It's a battle I've got to win.
I can't give in.

[Chorus]

Bound for destiny, for greatness
Yet they both struggled with the nonsense
As evidence they were meant to be more
Yet they can't seem to finally find the score 
'Cause the game they played was rigged from the beginning
And in the end I sit on the sidelines and cry
Both cues stuck in a parallel universe will lose their lives",On the Boulevard,2011
Adonis Rose,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

The mic is the teacher, to get you out the cage
From the get-go, the critics ranted and raved

Where the body, the mind, the soul become one
Intertwined with PEACE and hostility none

For the master plan is surely to attract (uh!)
The people it take, the speakers to quake, the points to make
The A.D.O.R. possesses what it takes
To make it feel good, the way it should
Give me the mic and Pete Rock and you know I could
Stand up get'cha all, uh, all night long (yeah)
It feels too right, too strong to be wrong
Let's turn it up, full blast, and make it last

Enter my center where the tormenters rest
Blessed by thy blessings, to learn a hard lesson
Protected by the thugs with the large Smith & Wessons
Got the bombs undressed (woo!)

C'MON! Ah, into the center of the haze
Where the style rocks hot, let's get it on the only way

Where the style rocks hot, let's get it on the only way

[Verse Two]
Feel on the rapture, let the haze catch ya
The props, the love and the gains is what I'm after
The raptor, beatin down rappers runnin wild
See the fullness, feel the pure Mecca child
The profile to fiend rocks on again
It's all hot here so go tell your friend
So he can tell his man and they won't pretend
Cause the burn so real that they all attend
My MC show, they break the front do'
Got the lime Alize for the Player's Club
Guaranteein all wins like Broadway Joe
And if you ain't heard, act like you know
That the, beast from the East is comin for his piece of pie
I'm in that freak mode, son it's time to do or die
See you know why, the dope got your mind high
You gotta stay fly once you come up out the get by

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Three]
So as you, analyze me, I paralyze you
So what'chu gonna do when the one man wreckin crew
steps up, I'm +Energizing+, +Ever ready+
I rock the beat hard, got a blast for the petty
If you're ready though, you can come and enter the stage
And feel the raw wrath, and the pleasures of the rage
The rampage, my people, will not be televised
Front if you want kid, we're always recognized
I, up and rise, my movement's generation
The penetration, soul sensation
On to live, that life divine
Yo I pass to my people or sip the wine
cause, time is short, this style gets hard
Representin to the grave, rough rugged and scarred
Worldwide! ... Worldwide!  So everybody

Steppin' up to bum-rush the stage
Get the crew motivator by the spark of the rage
The mic is the teacher, to get you out the cage
From the get-go, the critics ranted and raved
Cause Hip-Hop was too strong
The road to the riches we began to pave
Where the body, the mind, the soul become one
Intertwined with PEACE and hostility none
Is the message loud and clear, for all to hear
And may the crowds cheer (uh!) which is a season of the year
The flow, a-to a rugged kind of tempo
And what this all means it's time to let yourself go (go)
It's time to get you on to this ninety-delic tip
I'm not a hippie but yo be I'm hip
A ninety-delic definition means no more self doubt (yeah)

A feeling of good times, musical highs (yeah)
Rhythm, harmony, soul skills and that put together
For the master plan is surely to attract (uh!)
The people it take, the speakers to quake, the points to make
The A.D.O.R. possesses what it takes
To make it feel good, the way it should
Give me the mic and Pete Rock and you know I could
Stand up get'cha all, uh, all night long (yeah)
It feels too right, too strong to be wrong
Let's turn it up, full blast, and make it last
Yo I'm thinkin' bout the future, {fuck} the past
With the beat that's pumpin' (uh)

For Another Definition Of the Rhythm is what you demand (yeah)
Pump your fists and yell go, go

For all to feel, cause our feeling is real

If you can shake it (shake it), and not fake it (fake it)

I like black tea, I like black D
I never touched Tina, and that's the T
I know I'm what's the T, I said that I don't drink
So you bitches probably don't even know what to think
When you see me in the club gettin' crunk
Acting stupid, getting drunk
I got a hundred problems, drinkin' ain't one
I tried to quit drinking but it's too much fun
I keep it cute and I act my age
And you're never ever gonna see me drunk on stage

I smashed some pumpkins, rat in a cage
Let's pay women an equal wage
No seriously
What the fuck

Now let's talk about my exes
I cheated on Sharon with a guy in Texas
I'm just kidding he was really in Florida
But what the fuck fucking rhymes with Florida?
We were good together but we're better apart
And I learned a lot from that broken heart
Sharon and Chad, I'm happy for you
Cerrone the Cat I fucking miss you boo
Now every breakup turned out so well
I put a lot of really nice guys through some fucked up hell
But then there was this one guy
Girl
And if you have Reddit, you probably know all about this already
Uh

This psycho ex got heavy handed
Tried to Death Star my whole fucking planet
Talkin' shit, droppin' names
Screen cappin', playin' games
I've had it, officially!
The bitch tried to really really come for me!
He crossed me like the River Styx
But the sex was good 'cause I like small dicks

I'm not mad, I'm not pressed
The money's on the dresser, get dressed
To the twunk ass messes in the meet and greet
Tryna treat a Ru Girl like a piece of meat, ow!
You're spillin' my dress bitch!
You think you're a fan, but you're only a mess, bitch!
Real fans? I fucking love you
I'd lay myself down on the train tracks for you
In fact, I made this fucking record for you
Call me Delano, 'cause I Adore you (Oh)

Yeah, you (yeah)
Specifically (oh)

The AAA Girls went bankrupt morally
Willam met some models and serviced them orally
He's probably on his way to replace us quick

The secret I've been hiding like a ding-a-ling
I did some challenges, I won a few
Oh, yeah, that's a thing called All Stars 2
I can't blame you Adore
They went in really harsh that first day
And if it had been me in your position, who knows?
I might've done the same thing

I'm just lucky, I guess, I feel blessed, but I'm stressed
I wanna be the best, I just wanna be the best
A hundred thousand dollars, it ain't that much
To fuck up your mind and all your friends that you trust

I'm sorry mom, I wanna smoke some marijuana

Adrenaline Mob,"It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly

It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the fire
Stand up and shout-shout

You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl

You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the fire
Stand up and shout

You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again

You own the road
You are the fire go on explode

You've got the power

Sabiendo cual será nuestra respuesta
Voy sin saber lo que harás de mi

Prefiero callarme a confesar
que me haces sentir

He abierto mis ojos
Cancelando mis enojos
Y he sentido que te tengo un poco mas
Aprovecho y me cuelo enredándote en mi pelo
Insistiendo en que me vuelvas a buscar
90 minutos no puede durar el amor
Pideme mas

La luna brilla mas cuando esta inquieta
Quedando el sol detrás para alumbrarla
Así me siento yo, siempre andas detrás
A mi alrededor te intuyo
Son mis besos solo tuyos
Aunque bese a otro más

He abierto mis ojos
Cancelando mis enojos

Que estas cansado de andar y de andar 
Y caminar girando siempre en un lugar

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda 
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera

Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar

Adrian Bal,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,2003

I took a walk into the back of my mind
Through the trash and the warning signs
There was a party full of jokes and clich's
I couldn't think of anything to say
And so I slipped into the men's room there
I saw my hair a way it's never been before

I took the stairs from my head to my heart
I didn't know they were so far apart
The heart is like a little chapel somewhere,
The pretty lights and the empty chairs
But I'm gonna bring a broom next time
I'll sweep out all the broken strings I find

She walks me down to my private train
And lays me down in my sleeping car
She keeps my elephant out of the rain
And sees to the care of my vintage cars
She is the blood of my life
Without her I would starve

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna hide behind?
Who you gonna turn to
When there's nobody home but you?

What's a father to do
With all theses school-less injuns
Running in circles around the wagons
What's a father to do
With all these monster debts
Around my neck
On a sad sun deck
Oh, my children, the times are jaded
The simple life is complicated
Oh, my children

Now if the dark of the night
Arrives in the middle of the day
I'm gonna say my prayer
For sweetness and light,
Gonna fix myself a Coke,
And hope it's alright

If the bat-winged beast sweep down
For a feast on me
I'm gonna pin my soul
To a hot-air balloon
Gonna make it pop
And shoot me to the moon

A cup of coffee and a slice of time
If you'll excuse me I should say goodbye

Adrian Belew,"Wouldn't it be great
To see the African plains
Before they lay them to waste
And only the bones remain
Wouldn't it be poetry
To shoot holes in the poachers we see
With an elephant gun
Men in helicopters fly
Shooting rhinos from out of the sky
Why do we always assume
The planet is ours to ruin?
What a legacy we`re leaving behind
What a legacy
Wouldn't it be something
For the men killing dolphin
To be caught up by their necks
In their greedy fishing nets
Wouldn't it be irony
If the tuna fish canneries
Were to fall into the sea
The dolphins and the whales still left alive
Cry to the stars in the deep blue night
""There's nowhere to hide,
The people on earth will not be denied""
What a legacy we're leaving behind
What a legacy
Wouldn't it be odd
If there really was a God
And he looked down on earth
And saw what we've done to Her
Wouldn't it be just
If He pulled the plug on us,
And took away the sun",Men in Helicopters,1990

You can hear them cry

Never a tear on my burning dress.""

A brave prey who lays dying
And is surrounded by angry spirits
Hunters, guns, drums, and elephants

Filled with trees, filled with eyes
As she prowls around my feet
She throws back her head dress and cries
""Now you will be mine,

I gave her my best years
Well, what can you do but laugh
I don't expect she'll ever be coming back

When we climbed up the great Appalachians
Her engines would be raging like hell
Then we'd come back down to the rising towns
Where the cattle stare

In the frozen air
For me there nothing more sacred
Than the beautiful sound she'd make
Her long blue signal blowin' deep in the night,

It would get to me there, 
It would get to me there
Now I'm afraid...

Afraid of these silent hours
Awake underneath my old cap
I don't expect she'll ever be coming back

How do we now view ourselves,
Sitting victims in a shelter needing help?
How do we now regain control
Over the remnants of our life without a home?

If a bomb had hit us, nothing less would remain
Not a wall to lean on, not a fork or a plate
But at least we made it out and we're still alive
And we're starting over now in the middle of the night

It's a matter of time, a struggle to survive
But it doesn't need to be a lonely fight
If we stand by each other
We'll be sure of our survival in the wild

Underneath a burning sky
The tenants of the fire
Sit in silence as they ponder
Survival in the wild",Survival in the Wild,1994

Late at night when it's hard to rest

Recostado en la vidriera y esperándote

Ya nunca alumbraré con las estrellas
Nuestra marcha sin querellas
Por las noches de Pompeya

Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
Y mi amor y tu ventana
Todo ha muerto, ya lo sé

San Juan y boedo antiguo, cielo perdido
Pompeya y al llegar al terraplén
Tus veinte años temblando de cariño
Bajo el beso que entonces te robé

Nostalgias de las cosas que han pasado
Arena que la vida se llevó
Pesadumbre de barrios que han cambiado
Y amargura del sueño que murió

",Sir,2003
Adrian Iaies Trio,"Primero hay que saber sufrir
Después amar, después partir
Y al fin andar sin pensamiento
Perfume de naranjo en flor
Promesas vanas de un amor
Que se escaparon con el viento

Después, qué importa del después
Toda mi vida es el ayer
Que me detiene en el pasado
Eterna y vieja juventud
Que me ha dejado acobardado
Como un pájaro sin luz

Dolor de vieja arboleda
Canción de esquina
Con un pedazo de vida
Naranjo en flor",Naranjo en Flor,2007
Adrian Iaies Trio,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad

Adrian Ingram,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

To put the reason to the rhyme
Everbody has their day
But sooner or later we're all gonna stray
Gone astray
Just like a loaded gun, finger on the trigger
And having fun
Nobody'd gonna stand in my way

Don't lose touch, slip through my hands
And out of reach
Come onn back, we'll work it out someway
The stakes are high, but you can't gamble with your life
Can't you see I need you here today

Adrian Smith,"Late at night
Rain falling down
Sets my mind wandering
Took a drive on a highway
I saw you standing in the rain
Destiny was calling me
I would never be the same

You said you said your heart was aching, you were sad
I saw you cry, the night you lied to me, oh no!
You took my hand then faded with the light
They said you died out on the road that night

I'm in a cold cold sweat
Knuckles white upon the wheel
Danger flies on silent wings
I can't fight and I can't feel
Now I'm standing in the daylight
And it seems just like dream
If only I could touch you girl
But you're not there for real!

You said you said your heart was aching, you were sad
I saw you cry, the night you lied to me, oh no!
You took my hand then faded with the light
They said you died out on the road that night",The Lion,1989
Adrian Smith,"In his mind, he's been to hell and back again
Left a trail of broken dreams
The smile you wear just hides your fear

On the edge of the night
You can't tell what's wrong from right
What went wrong with my mind
I've been bad, mistreated, they don't understand
Never make a diamond from a grain of sand
Out on my own nobody, I'd change if I could
I'm not a bad man, I'm just misunderstood...

Life's unkind, so hard upon an only child
Took it all out on the world
Don't you know two wrongs don't make a right
Look into my eyes
See the pain of a lifetime

I've been bad, mistreated, they don't understand
Never make a diamond from a grain of sand
Out on my own nobody, I'd change if I could
I'm not a bad man, I'm just misunderstood...
He wants to love somebody, nothing less
No man can take the pressure and loneliness
He's over the edge

Adrian Smith,"Darkness descending
Night coming down in the city
She walks the streets in search of fortune
Down in a doorway a man with no hope or pride
He can't go on, he can't survive
Out in the jungle called the city
You'll never make it on your own
You got to have that

Silver and gold see you grow old
Turn with your back to the wall
Silver and gold out in the cold
Run but there's nowhere to go

He's got no future, all just because of his past
He's got a gun he's tired of talking
Hole in your pocket hole in your shoe
Chip on your shoulder you got that too
You steal a ride you're tired of talking

Out in the cold, cold winter city
You'll never make it on your own",Silver and Gold,1989
Adrian Smith,"Locked up, banged up, can't think for yourself
Twenty four hours in a teen foot cell
Rights of a prisoner, needs of a dog
Stare at a ceiling, make your peace with god

Night falls, my heart calls
Hours turn to days
Daybreak heartache, looking down in disbelief

I see myself it can't be wishing your life away,
Pray that that tomorrow comes
Cry your tears today, yesterday will never come, well, well...

Backed up, jacked up, it's worse than you think
Thirty long days for one little drink
No hand on the wheel, no foot on the floor
Just walls and a ceiling and a slamming of a cell door

Lights out, the nights shout
The days drag on and on
Day breaks my heart aches
No way out there's no space
I think this time I'm going crazy
Whishing your life away
Pray that tomorrow comes
Cry your tears today
Yesterday is dead and gone",Wishing Your Life Away,1989

Now I feel it's right to share

Life is not a cross we bear
Take a look around

Time flows like a river she goes
Make the best of what you've got
When a man is born into the earth he's thrown
Make this your paradise

You could be a king but it don't mean a thing
If what's sin our heart remains unspoken
Look for the truth before it looks for you
Your heart strong and never broken

There's a city in the sky built for you and I
Keeps us dreaming on and on, on and on
Now I search my soul, looking for a sign
Show you right where I went wrong

Adrian Smith,"And here, my prize, the Black Widow. 
Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. 
Her kiss is fifteen times more poisonous than the rattlesnake. 
And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death. 
You know what I think I love the most about her 
Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. 
If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy
I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling dimented child-king long enough!
And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor! 

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he'll brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be destroyed
And every girl and boy
Will learn to be employed
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

He sits upon his throne
And picks at all the bones
Of his husbands and his wives
He's devoured
He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene
and the children and the virgins
He's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our dreams are webbed in haze
Mindless, senseless daze

She was amazing Carmela, caramel complexion
Think God brought em into my life as a suggestion
We click, I like mink, she like iced out rings
The finer things in life, together we share drinks
Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry
If I got luck she will fill up my commissary
It was matching, I felt the bomb between us
She was the jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus
The earth to my sun, moon and stars we added up
Mathematically, it’s like I had a bad habit
Bitch you knew my lifestyle, check of a crime boss
She would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force
Finish my sentence, do my exact frame of mind
Knew everything I had was hers and she was mine
We were crazy in love, couldn’t get enough of each other
The center of attraction, we were made for one another

Nah, don’t even fall for that corkazoid
She got the drink blazed, try and turn into a android
She not yo peanut butter, more like a fuckin' nut case
You’re a grouper, that De Lucas mob brought you to place
They blowing trains on a beating rate, come in her face
They got the drop on you sun, you a fuckin' disgrace
You think God sent her? I’d ask the devil instead
They got plans for you Ton, they want you dead dead dead
So get rid of that cherry popper, she mad poison through pa, carajo
They bout to bring the poison
Yea Thunder, De Lucas mob want yo head on the platter

She a snake, mogy gone, get yo sprayed rubber
It’s a set-up, seen it before, Doofy got wet up

Nah you paranoid, letting yo mind get the best of you
She would never set me up or lace my drink
Watch how you talkin', you know what? You heatin' the mink
You dead wrong, confusion help with one of yo hoes
She’s erratic, that chick, believe me
A nigga knows I’m the el capitan, put this whole squad together
Keep talkin' bro, I put one in yo leather
Ball cap, Logan to do the hit, now that’s better

Ah man
Come on Ton
You sleepy eyes man

Get hunted like a rat in a field, I hate that
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps

Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm
I want bodies, balucas, spread into the waters
I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder their daughters

Hunt them down in alphabetical order
Each person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter
The butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker
I'mma send you right back to your maker
A few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil

And use everything in their power to shut us down

Got a new connect, Don Stone
Flew his private jet from Rome to talk business

Divinely touched by angels; There was no time for lust

Plus some'll tell that a teenage love Will never last
Looking through the glass of past scars
Fast forward to the future
Where the youth Them are a-changing

But this couple don't care what you saying
They're hearts blazing
Can't nobody tell 'em nothing
Their love is unstoppable

See, I was told all in love is unfair

Fishing, dishing, and wishing upon air

Is do it your own way, the long way

Visions of intermingled souls
Matching afros, juleps on a creaky porch
Life at a slower tempo
No regulations to encroach upon their relations Cantankerous kinfolks, damn
If they can't accept us then we gonna scram

Found himself the daughter of a kingpin

He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge
Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz
No friends, no foes, only evil to expose
Let's make a video
Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter
And I ain't lookin for no ransom
I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug!
I want him to watch me strangle his daughter
Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies!
M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
This is just the fuckin tip of the storm!
Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush!
As soon as he step in the building
AMBUSH!

At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate
Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
They raided the Kane gang [?]
The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place
He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee
He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight
Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang!
But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!""
And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane
Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings!
Finally it was over
The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
They shifted through the dead remains
The bedrooms, and the entry way
WHERE THE HELL IS LESTER KANE?!

Now what is this that stands before me?
Underneath this wack off coughing
It's Logan and her half beat offspring
I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing

Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had 
staked out the vacated building for eight days
They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route
The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house
Where to find Logan and her afraid child
In a dark corner where they were being held
They were blindfolded with taped mouths

Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear your touch and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my scene and start healing me scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Cane, you better show me
You're a man of your work, a criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up

I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber

Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent

Lifeless, his body left stuck in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer
Crime born syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seat in this cold world, my heart's aching

Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels on, thinking clusty
Me and the father ain't rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Cane or died I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life you find in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you is one force
There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods
Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
So you hesitating - I didn't hesitate but you

Um dia me beijou e disse ""não me esqueça""
Foi embora
E só esqueci metade
Que bom que eu não tinha um revólver
Quem ama mata mais com bala que com flecha
Ela deixou furo
E a porta que abriu
Jamais se fecha

Curto as coisas que acendem e apagam
E se acendem novamente em vão
Será que a gente é louca ou lúcida

Eu deixo

Há algo que jamais se esclareceu:
Onde foi exatamente que larguei
Naquele dia mesmo
O leão que sempre cavalguei?
Lá mesmo esqueci
Que o destino
Sempre me quis só
No deserto sem saudade, sem remorso só
Sem amarras, barco embriagado ao mar

Que está sendo amado, que está amando, e que
Encontrou tudo o que a vida poderia oferecer

Os nossos castelos, e cria um mundo de encanto onde tudo é belo
Até que a mulher que a gente ama, vacila e põe tudo a perder

Cada um pro seu lado, a vida é isso mesmo
Eu vou procurar e sei que vou encontrar
Alguém melhor que você, espero que seja feliz
No seu novo caminho, ficar contigo
Não faz sentido, melhor assim

Me dê motivo, foi jogo sujo
E agora eu fujo pra não sofrer
Fui teu amigo, te dei o mundo
Você foi fundo, quis me perder
Agora é tarde, não tem mais jeito
O teu defeito não tem perdão
Eu vou à luta, que a vida é curta
Não vale a pena sofrer em vão

Pode crer você pôs tudo a perder
Não podia me fazer o que fez
E por mais que você tente negar, me dê motivo
Pode crer eu vou sair por aí
E mostrar que posso ser bem feliz
Encontrar alguém que saiba me dar

Adriana Caselotti,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever

Someday my prince will come
Someday I 'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me

He'll whisper I love you
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away I'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true

Someday I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I know at the moment we meet
My heart will start skipping the beats

Someday we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away I'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true

Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know

Someday when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing and wedding bells will ring

Adriana Landeros,"Más que amor, lo que siento por ti.
Es el mal del animal, no la terquedad del jabalí, ni la furia del chacal...
Es el alma que se encela con instinto criminal, es amar, hasta que duela
como un golpe de puñal... ay, amor, ay, dolor...
yo te quiero con alevosía...

Necesito confundir tu piel con el frío del metal
o tal vez con el destello cruel de un fragmento de cristal...

No lo ha podido el saber

Ni el más ancho pensamiento

De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros

Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Pasaron, pasaron

Se quedó tu alegría y mi amor

Terribles, malvados
Dejando esa esperanza que no ha de llegar
Y recuerdo tu gesto travieso
Después de aquel beso
Robado al azar

Tu límpida voz
Tal vez escapó a tus ojeras

Burning a hole in my sky

And maybe it's all I need

On the ground, I think you could

It's just a path following

Has got you aiming at yourself

Ma un giorno disse
Vado in città
E lo diceva mentre piangeva
Io gli domando amico
Non sei contento
Vai finalmente a stare in città
Là troverai le cose che non hai avuto qui
Potrai lavarti in casa senza andar
Giù nel cortile

Mio caro amico, disse
Qui sono nato
In questa strada
Ora lascio il mio cuore
Ma come fai a non capire
È una fortuna, per voi che restate
A piedi nudi a giocare nei prati
Mentre là in centro respiro il cemento
Ma verrà un giorno che ritornerò
Ancora qui
E sentirò l'amico treno
Che fischia così
""wa wa""

Passano gli anni
Ma otto son lunghi
Però quel ragazzo ne ha fatta di strada
Ma non si scorda la sua prima casa
Ora coi soldi lui può comperarla
Torna e non trova gli amici che aveva
Solo case su case
Catrame e cemento

Là dove c'era l'erba ora c'è
Una città
E quella casa in mezzo al verde ormai
Dove sarà

Ehi, ehi

La la la la la la la la

Eh no
Non so, non so perché
Perché continuano
A costruire, le case
E non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba

Eh no
Se andiamo avanti così, chissà
Come si farà
Chissà",Il  Ragazzo Della Via Gluck [Parlato],1977
Adriano Celentano,"Tu non sai cosa ho fatto quel giorno quando io la incontrai
In spiaggia ho fatto il pagliaccio
Per mettermi in mostra agli occhi di lei
Che scherzava con tutti i ragazzi all'infuori di me
Perché perché perché perché, io le piacevo

Lei mi amava, mi odiava, mi amava
Mi odiava, era contro di me

Io non ero ancora il suo ragazzo e già soffriva per me
E per farmi ingelosire
Quella notte lungo il mare è venuta con te
Ora tu vieni a chiedere a me tua moglie dov'è
Dovevi immaginarti che un giorno o l'altro
Sarebbe andata via da te
L'hai sposata sapendo che lei
Sapendo che lei moriva per me
Coi tuoi soldi hai comprato il suo corpo non certo il suo cuor

Lei mi amava, mi odiava, mi amava
Mi odiava, era contro di me

Io non ero ancora il suo ragazzo e già soffriva per me
E per farmi ingelosire
Quella notte lungo il mare è venuta con te
Un giorno io vidi lei entrar nella mia stanza
Mi guardava silenziosa, aspettava un sì da me
Dal letto io mi alzai e tutta la guardai
Sembrava un angelo
Mi stringeva sul suo corpo, mi donava la sua bocca
Mi diceva sono tua
Ma di pietra io restai

Io l'amavo, la odiavo, la amavo
La odiavo, ero contro di lei

Se non ero stato il suo ragazzo era colpa di lei
E uno schiaffo all'improvviso le mollai sul suo bel viso
Rimandandola da te
A letto ritornai, piangendo la sognai, sembrava un angelo
Mi stringeva sul suo corpo, mi donava la sua bocca
Mi diceva sono tua e nel sogno la baciai

Di giusti al mondo non ce n'è
Come mai, il mondo è così brutto!? 
Sì! Siamo stati noi a rovinare 
Questo capolavoro sospeso nel cielo
Nel cielo, nel cielo! 

Leggo che 
Sulla terra 
Sempre c'è 
Una guerra
Ma però
Per fortuna
Stiamo arrivando
Sulla luna 
Mentre qui

Ci si ammazza gli altri dì 
Guarda un po' che società! 
Ipocrisia
Qua e là
Non va! 

Non esiste morale
C'è per tutti un complesso
Un problema del sesso 
E le persone serie 
Che non raccontano le storie 
Le hanno spedite in ferie! 

Questa terra è il monopolio 
Delle idee sbagliate
Qui si premiano quei films 
Dove c'è un morto in più

Si divorano i romanzi 
Con l'indizio a rate
C'è persino corruzione 
Dove c'è lo sport 

Noo ragazzi
Ma non rattristatevi così 
Piccolo? Perché piangi? 
Eeh, allora staremmo freschi se veramente nel mondo succedessero tutte queste cose
Eh, e poi, lo sapete anche voi, no? 
I giornali qualche volta esagerano sempre un po'
Guardate quello che scrivono su di me
E poi se andiamo a vedere 
Questo giornale chissà di quanti anni è 
Anzi, adesso voglio proprio guardare la data 
È di oggi! 

E se noi 
Tutti insieme 
In un clan
Ci uniremo
Cambierà
Questo mondo 
Se noi daremo 
Una mano 
A chi ha 
Più bisogno
Ci sarà
Solo amore
Solo amore
Ci sarà

Adriano Celentano,"Tu non sai cosa ho fatto quel giorno quando io la incontrai
In spiaggia ho fatto il pagliaccio
Per mettermi in mostra agli occhi di lei
Che scherzava con tutti i ragazzi all'infuori di me
Perché perché perché perché, io le piacevo

Lei mi amava, mi odiava, mi amava
Mi odiava, era contro di me

Io non ero ancora il suo ragazzo e già soffriva per me
E per farmi ingelosire
Quella notte lungo il mare è venuta con te
Ora tu vieni a chiedere a me tua moglie dov'è
Dovevi immaginarti che un giorno o l'altro
Sarebbe andata via da te
L'hai sposata sapendo che lei
Sapendo che lei moriva per me
Coi tuoi soldi hai comprato il suo corpo non certo il suo cuor

Lei mi amava, mi odiava, mi amava
Mi odiava, era contro di me

Io non ero ancora il suo ragazzo e già soffriva per me
E per farmi ingelosire
Quella notte lungo il mare è venuta con te
Un giorno io vidi lei entrar nella mia stanza
Mi guardava silenziosa, aspettava un sì da me
Dal letto io mi alzai e tutta la guardai
Sembrava un angelo
Mi stringeva sul suo corpo, mi donava la sua bocca
Mi diceva sono tua
Ma di pietra io restai

Io l'amavo, la odiavo, la amavo
La odiavo, ero contro di lei

Se non ero stato il suo ragazzo era colpa di lei
E uno schiaffo all'improvviso le mollai sul suo bel viso
Rimandandola da te
A letto ritornai, piangendo la sognai, sembrava un angelo
Mi stringeva sul suo corpo, mi donava la sua bocca
Mi diceva sono tua e nel sogno la baciai

Sta lentamente scendendo lungo il seno

Adriano Celentano,"A mezzanotte sai 
Che io ti penserò 
Ovunque tu sarai, sei mia 
E stringerò il cuscino fra le braccia 
Mentre cercherò il tuo viso 
Che splendido nell'ombra apparirà 

Mi sembrerà di cogliere 
Una stella in mezzo al ciel
Così tu non sarai lontano 
Quando brillerai nella mia mano

Ma non vorrei che tu 
A mezzanotte e tre
Stai già pensando a un altro uomo 
Mi sento già sperduto 
E la mia mano 
Dove prima tu brillavi
È diventata un pugno chiuso, sai

Cattivo come adesso 
Non lo sono stato mai
E quando mezzanotte viene 
Se davvero mi vuoi bene
Pensami mezz'ora almeno
E dal pugno chiuso 
Una carezza nascerà

E stringerò il cuscino fra le braccia
Mentre cercherò il tuo viso 
Che splendido nell'ombra apparirà

Adriano Celentano,"Semplici e un po' banali 
Io direi quasi prevedibili e sempre uguali 
Sono fatti tutti così gli uomini e l'amore 
Come vedi tanti aggettivi 
Che si incollano su noi 
Dai che non siamo poi cattivi 

Tu non sei niente male 
Parli bene e mi sorprendi quando tiri forte 
La tua moto dal motore che sento truccato 
E va bene guida tu che sei brava più di me 
Ed attendo che sia amore 

Ma io (ma tu) sono con te ogni giorno 
Perché di te ho bisogno 
Non voglio di più 
Acqua e sale 
Mi fai bere 
Con un colpo mi trattieni il bicchiere 
Mi fai male 
Poi godere se mi vedi in un angolo ore ed ore 
Ore piene 
Come un lago 
Che se piove un po' di meno è uno stagno 
Vorrei dire
Non conviene
Sono io a pagare amore tutte le pene 

Vedi divertirsi fa bene 
Sento che mi rido dentro e questo non mi conviene 
C'è qualcosa che non va ma non so dirti cosa 
È la tua moto che sta giù 
Che vorrei guidare io 
O meglio averti qui vicino a me? 

Ma io, io sono con te ogni giorno 
Perché di te ho bisogno 
Non voglio di più

Adriano Celentano,"Io non so parlar d'amore
L'emozione non ha voce
E mi manca un po' il respiro
Se ci sei c'è troppa luce
La mia anima si spande
Come musica d'estate
Poi la voglia sai mi prende
E si accende con i baci tuoi

Io con te sarò sincero
Resterò quel che sono
Disonesto mai lo giuro
Ma se tradisci non perdono

Ti sarò per sempre amico
Pur geloso come sai
Io lo so mi contraddico
Ma preziosa sei tu per me

Tra le mie braccia dormirai
Serenamente
Ed è importante questo sai
Per sentirci pienamente noi

Un'altra vita mi darai
Che io non conosco
La mia compagna tu sarai
Fino a quando so che lo vorrai

Due caratteri diversi
Prendon fuoco facilmente
Ma divisi siamo persi
Ci sentiamo quasi niente
Siamo due legati dentro
Da un amore che ci dà
La profonda convinzione
Che nessuno ci dividerà

Tra le mie braccia dormirai
Serenamente
Ed è importante questo sai
Per sentirci pienamente noi

Un'altra vita mi darai
Che io non conosco
La mia compagna tu sarai
Fino a quando lo vorrai

Poi vivremo come sai
Solo di sincerità
Di amore e di fiducia
Poi sarà quel che sarà

Adriano Celentano,"Al matinèe
Del giovedì
Ballo liscio
Al garden blu

Co l'orchestra serenade
Spengono le luci
Tacciono le voci
E nel buio senti sussurrar

Prego vuoi ballare con me?
Grazie preferisco di no
Non ballo il tango col casquè
Perciò grazie
Prego, grazie, scusi
Tornerò

Al matinèe
Del garden blu
Richii premi
E cotillons

Fascia d'oro per la miss

Perciò grazie
Prego, grazie, scusi
Tornerò

Adriano Celentano,"Questa è la storia
di uno di noi,
anche lui nato per caso in via Gluck,
in una casa, fuori città,
gente tranquilla, che lavorava.
Là dove see'era l'erba ora see'è
una città,
e quella casa
in mezzo al verde ormai,
dove sarà?

Questo ragazzo della via Gluck,
si divertiva a giocare con me,
ma un giorno disse,
vado in città,
e lo diceva mentre piangeva,
io gli domando amico,
non sei contento?
Vai finalmente a stare in città.
Là troverai le cose che non hai avuto qui,
potrai lavarti in casa senza andar
giù nel cortile!

Mio caro amico, disse,
qui sono nato,
in questa strada
ora lascio il mio cuore.
Ma come fai a non capire,
è una fortuna, per voi che restate
a piedi nudi a giocare nei prati,
mentre là in centro respiro il cemento.
Ma verrà un giorno che ritornerò
ancora qui
e sentirò l'amico treno
che fischia così,
""wa wa""!

Passano gli anni,
ma otto son lunghi,
però quel ragazzo ne ha fatta di strada,
ma non si scorda la sua prima casa,
ora coi soldi lui può comperarla
torna e non trova gli amici che aveva,
solo case su case,
catrame e cemento.

Là dove see'era l'erba ora see'è
una città,
e quella casa in mezzo al verde ormai
dove sarà.

Ehi, Ehi,

La la la... la la la la la...

Eh no,
non so, non so perché,
perché continuano
a costruire, le case
e non lasciano l'erba
non lasciano l'erba
non lasciano l'erba
non lasciano l'erba

Eh no,
se andiamo avanti così, chissà
come si farà,
chissà...",Il Ragazzo Della Via Gluck [Live],2006
Adriano Celentano,"Ti proteggerò dalle paure delle ipocondrie
Dai turbamenti che da oggi incontrerai per la tua via
Dalle ingiustizie e dagli inganni del tuo tempo
Dai fallimenti che per tua natura normalmente attirerai

Ti sollleverò dai dolori e dai tuoi sbalzi d'umore
Dalle ossessioni delle tue manie
Supererò le correnti gravitazionali
Lo spazio e la luce per non farti invecchiare
E guarirai da tutte le malattie

Perchè sei un essere speciale
Ed io avrò cura di te

Vagavo per I campi del Tennessee
Come vi ero arrivato chissà
Non hai fiori bianchi per me?
Più veloci di aquile I miei sogni

Attraversano il mare
Ti porterò soprattutto il silenzio e la pazienza
Percorreremo assieme le vie che portano all'essenza
I profumi d'amore inebrieranno I nostri corpi
La bonaccia d'Agosto non calmerà I nostri sensi

Tesserò I tuoi capelli come trame di un canto
Conosco le leggi del mondo e te ne farò dono
Supererò le correnti gravitazionali
Lo spazio e la luce per non farti invecchiare
Ti salverò da ogni malinconia

Perchè sei un essere speciale
Ed io avrò cura di te
Io sì che avrò cura di te

Lasciami sfogare
Io senza amore non so stare
Io non posso restare

E poi non provare
Un brivido dentro
E correrti incontro, gridarti

Non mollo, lo giuro

Per farti valere

Ti voglio aiutare
Su, fammi provare ancora

Adriano Pennino,"Vorrei avere un po' di soldi nelle tasche per andarmene in America
Ma da dietro una finestra guardo fuori mentre è cominciato a piovere
Pomeriggi tristi e vuoti, scuri come delle vecchie gallerie
I miei giorni sono uguali a quei vagoni fermi nelle ferrovie
Questo maledetto inverno non si ferma sulle porte, gela l'anima
Sto scaldando tra le mani questa penna per provare almeno a scriverti
Cambierebbe tutto quanto all'improvviso se tu fossi qui con me
Perché dentro la mia vita c'è quel vuoto che hai lasciato
E che nessuno può calmare tranne te

Tu che ne sai, che sto ancora a pensarti da solo
Tu che ne sai, e se cade una stella dal cielo la dedico a noi
Che respiro i ricordi più belli in un dolce replay
Ma diventa più grigio del fumo quell'arcobaleno
Non c'è sale nell'acqua del mare
Non riscaldano i raggi del sole, lontano da te
Dove sarai avrai già raccontato la storia che parla di noi
Ce l'hai ancora nascosto il segreto più bello che hai
Io speravo che non arrivasse nemmeno Natale
Passerà però adesso fa male
Perché ho perso la cosa più bella da stringere a me

Questo maledetto inverno non si ferma sulle porte, gela l'anima
Vorrei uscire dalla casa ma i ricordi non mi fanno ancora muovere
Il tuo viso non va via, rimane qui sempre davanti agli occhi miei
Se sapessi che ogni tanto ti ritorno nella mente
Crescerebbe la speranza dentro me

Tu che ne sai, che sto ancora a pensarti da solo
Tu che ne sai, giuro sempre che è l'ultima volta che parlo di noi
Stringo tutta la storia nei pugni, fa male alle mani
Tra un minuto sarà già domani
Ma domani sarà tutto uguale lontano da te
Dove sarai avrai già raccontato la storia che parla di noi
Ce l'hai ancora nascosto il segreto più bello che hai
Io speravo che non arrivasse nemmeno Natale
Passerà pero adesso fa male

Y por eso me voy.

When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me, uncontrollable

My focus is gone by the beat of your drums
Drums, drums, drums

I can't even sleep and I can't even analyze
Why I'm so tempted by? Do I need to slow down?
(No)
'Cause right now I can't even find it
I kinda like the way it's flowing

It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me, uncontrollable

It's uncontrollable
It's uncontrollable

The joy that it brings, it overtakes me
It fulfills my fantasies, all of my dreams
The joy that it brings, it overtakes me
It keeps on forcing me, keeps on pushing me

It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me

It's uncontrollable and I just can't help it
When I try to leave and I'm right back at it
It's so uncontrollable and I just can't hide it
When I try to leave it keeps on pushing me, uncontrollable

It's uncontrollable
It's uncontrollable

Adrienne Bailon,"[Chorus]
I could be your friend, I could be your tease
I can be a freak, I can be a P.Y.T.
If you ask, I'll be that
I could be your girl, I could be your wife
I complete your side, I could be watching me
If you ask, I'll be that
I'll be your homey, lover, friend, I'll be your everything
If you ask, I'll be that
Say you want me, I'll come running
I can be your baby, just you ask, I'll be that

My girl, my love, come through, rescue me
Throw me on the bed, no clothes, wrestle me
After smashing that, then will you cook for me
Promise I won't hit you, you don't have to be shook of me
Washing my boxers, shirts folded nice and creased
Plus when we argue, she will never pull a beast
Clap for my baby, award winning, best nookie
I been in the whole wide world, that's why I stay spending

[Chorus]

I want you in a scarf, boy shorts around the house
Wife beater, undercover, sitting on the couch
Isley's is playing, lights dim, vanilla candles is melting
It's a long time, don't let no one else in
Fresh out the tub, sweetness and peaches
Body work splash around your neck, the kid admire all your features
Niggas be hollering; peace ma, what up boo?
You suck your teeth and keep it moving with the screw, yes

[Chorus]

Happy birthday, red roses, big cakes
Donna Karen slippers, got your birthday gift by the lake
Big boats, thick ropes, ostrich purses
Snakeskin boots, Jared Jewelers, the mink cost mad loot
Ski trips, resorts, close your eyes, baby, make a wish
Blow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out
Will you marry me? Will you carry me?
Through rain, hail, sleet and snow
Don't say no, you'll embarrass me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll be that, I'll be that",I'll Be That,2009

I'll see you when I'm better

It's gotta get worse to get better
It went from no way, never to okay, whatever
Slowly but surely and sure as sure is blurry
Now things that once were me are no longer
Every so often God reminds me
But I'm always there in front to blind me
I value my pride more than peace of mind
My precious pride
There was a time when I had control but I let it go
I watched the world passin' slow-mo
My life's ahead of me
I can't catch up
Stuck in a rut
I went too willingly
These thoughts are killing me
I wish I could control myself but I can't

Thoughts lead to emotion which led to action
I hate the fact that it happened
The Lord can forgive and forget
But I'm not able to do it
Maybe there is where the problem lies
I'm unable to forgive myself plus I'm too proud to ask for help
Whelp, sorry for who I've become
I guess circumstances can leave you numb
Plus, I refused accountability
It seemed like such small things you found in me
I called you secluded and alluded to the fact that your concerns were silly
Don't over-react
Now looking back in hindsight, huh
I'm able to see that you were right
Is it too late for me?
I know it's not
It's just up to me to choose to stop

I'm not alright, I haven't been myself lately
I'm not okay with the way I've let my thoughts overtake

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

Say, lend me a coat?

How can you do this thing to me?

Maintenant chéri, si tu m’aimes, si tu m’aimes 
Viens-y, viens-y, viens-y, viens-y... !

Dans mes bras, dans mes bras 
Ouais je sais ça fait peur 
Les yeux dans les yeux 
Dans mes bras, ça fait peur 

Dans mes bras pour t’aimer dans mes bras 
Sans craintes et sans remords, laisse-le à moi ton cœur 
Et si les autres femmes tu les hantes, moi tu m’auras vivante 
Car c’est bien trop facile de toujours s’échapper 
Ouais je sais t’es sensible, ouais je sais chéri mais 
Maintenant qu’on est tous les deux, si tu l’oses, si tu l’oses 
Montre-toi, montre-toi, montre-toi ...!

Dans mes bras,dans mes bras 
Ouais je sais ça fait peur 
Les yeux dans les yeux 
Dans tes bras ça fait peur 

Dans les bras, de la mer dis-le moi 
Si tu m’aimes et sans détours, vite avant que je me noie 
...Que tu m’aimes et pour toujours embrasse-moi mon amour 
Perdue dans le bleu, du sable dans les yeux 
Non ! je sais pas nager, viens m’chercher, viens m’chercher 
Puisqu’il faut bien s’en sortir nous deux 
Maintenant si tu m’aimes un peu, sauve-moi!

Comme ma vie qu´est triste à pleurer
Mon truc c´était contact humain
Dire des points d´vue, serrer des mains
C´est toujours la même musique
Sur mon piano à fric
Avec mes doigts mécaniques
J´enregistre, j´enregistre
En attendant, j´encaisse, 
C´est fou ce que j´encaisse
J´encaisse
Tout en rêvant c´est passionnant
A la vue des autres qui passent devant
Mais des fois ça m´fait mal à l´œil

Comme si c´était ça mon bonheur
Comme si ils me faisaient une fleur

Juste une sale bête : le méchant cafard

Qui veut pas, elle m´embête avec ses mots en retard
Qui me tourne la tête, ça me fout en pétard

Ah, si je pouvais trouver une fin!
La la la la la la la
Mais ça se commande pas une fin
La la la la la la la

Ah, si je pouvais la rêver!
La trouver sur mon oreiller
Entre deux pétards, ça m´a tuée
Entre deux cafards, je vais me coucher

You see you're the best thing that's happened to me
Maybe I should fight harder for you
But I said I'd let you go when you wanted me to

Have no power, I see the way you run, you run
You run as soon as we start to have fun
Maybe I will feel better alone
Or just feel something, my heart is turning to stone

So, so slow
Can you feel me letting go?
I, I know that we turn away
When the cracks begin to show

And now we're sleeping with the television and all the lights on
One of us is leaving soon but we're both already gone
Stuck at the lost and found, watch things disappear
Looking for the missing piece but it was never here

Every hour, I find a way, a way, a way
A way to convince myself to stay
Back and forth, I can't juggle
Lying here need to stand up and struggle

Ivory tower, I know the way you think, you think
You think it's making my heart sink
Unamused, tired of the antics
I'm sick of arguing over semantics

So, so slow
Can you feel me letting go?

When the cracks begin to show

And now we're sleeping with the television and all the lights on

What if I was good to you, what if you were good to me
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
What if it was paradise, what if we were symphonies
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You're the one who could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me no for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore",Lonely No More,2005

Blinded by Stars


My blood does remember the rhythm of a drum

Beat by a boy soldier whose revolution won

I?ve carried pretty flowers to fallen heroes graves

& stood in silence honoring the price our fathers paid


This was their flag but this ain?t their fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This was their flag but this ain?t their fight


So what do you call justice & what is freedom for

Don?t let the towncrier decide if we go to war

'cause this ain?t about your medla

The choice is of the soul

& hate is never brave while mercy?s always, always sold


Blinded by stars tangled in stripes

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

This is my flag but this ain?t my fight


Now I was born a rebel, I question what I?m told

No wonder this young skin I?m wearin?

Feels so old


Don?t be blinded by stars tangled in stripes

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

This I s my flag but this ain?t my fight

Lonesome Road Blues


I walked on down that lonesome line

Hung my head and I cried

I wept and I cried under a willow tree

Out by the deep blue sea

My mama, my dear papa can be found,

And my brother on a county road

Now I been down that long plank walk,

I?m on my way back home


You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan

You cause me to leave my home

I cried last night and the night before

I swear I won?t cry anymore


Your fast mail train comin round that track

Killed my brown eyed boy

They took him down that smokey track

Brought him back on a cooling board

Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line

Just as far as I care to see

I have no money lost my brown eyed boy

These blues won?t set me free


You do cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan

You cause me to leave my home

I cried last night and the night before

I swear I won?t cry anymore


",Lonesome Road Blues,2004
Adrienne Young,"Gonna take a long time to get over you
Love's poison addiction offers me no rescue
Gonna be a hard road back to where I started from
'Cause you touched the deepest part of me and filled me
With your song
And I sang along

I believe in you and what you gotta do
But what you're goin' through is poison,
Poison to the two of us
Used to stand so tall
'Til I took the fall, greatest fall of all
Was when I fell for you

Our cloudy skies held lonely forms
Your anger familiar thick as air before a storm
Now lookin' back I know the truth was plain to see
I built my world around you 'cause I
I needed to believe
And I still believe

Time and time again we tried so hard to win
But the pleasures of a foolish paradise
Is nothing but a sin",Poison,2004

Sadie?s Song


Pretty boy, my faithless fallen angel

Took me completely in his arms

In his eyes, I saw Eden?s garden

But the serpent lay hidden in his charms

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there


He said, climb, little Sadie higher

Spread them downy wings and fly

You will find your crown of gilded glory next to mine

Climb, little Sadie, climb


Icy winds up on Lookout Mountain

Chilled two bodies to the bone

But for that man, I did gladly lay down my back

Upon a bed of stone

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there


Something?s wrong, I heard my voices whisper

I heard ?em whisper something?s wrong

A single shot, he said, ?Fare thee well, Sadie?

The round was cold, my breath was gone

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there

Soldier?s Joy


I am my mama?s darlin? boy

I am my mama?s darlin? boy

I am my mama?s darlin? boy

Play a little tune called soldier?s joy


15 cents for morphine

& 25 cents for the beer

It?s 15 cents for the morphine

Gonna take me away from here


I love somebody, yes I do

I love somebody, yes I do

I love somebody, yes I do

I love somebody and it might be you


I?m a gonna get a drink don?t you wanna go

I?m a gonna get a drink don?t you wanna go

I?m a gonna get a drink don?t you wanna go

Go down that georgie road

Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball

Chattanooga full of saloons
Knoxville full of republicans
And Memphis loves the Blues

Don't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball

Wish I had a sugar rump,
Sugar by the pound
Great big bowl to stir it in
Pretty gal to hand it around

Little bee makes the honey
Poor man picks cotton and corn,
Rich man see the money


Don't get weary, don't get weary children
Don't get weary, I'm coming from the ball

Hair so curly on her head,
She could not shut her mouth

Breathe into what I know

I know there's one god above us

How you see the clothes he wore

One truth over another
My pride your misery
Wrought this land from the hand of a brother
In the name of Liberty

While they went without at home
We sacrifice driving in our big cars
Chariots of modern Rome

Blind to history

For this waste of life and energy

We stake it all on the coming of a savior
Who'll right all the wrong we've done

My Sin is Pride

Will Kimbrough / Tim Littlefield



I let you walk away

I kept it all inside

Swore you?d be back someday

My Sin Is Pride


I could have reached out to you

But I felt like my hands were tied

I?m always bound to prove

My Sin Is pride


Wasted so many words

When I told the truth I lied

I never will confess

My Sin Is Pride


I?ve chosen a narrow path

Lost sight of the road so wide

But I never will look back

My Sin Is Pride


Nobody sees the pain

Nobody knows I?ve cried

I never will confess

My sin is pride

I never will confess

My Sin Is Pride

Walls of Jericho

Adrieenne Young


Lookin? much older

With dust on your shoulder

Well you crashed in this mornin?

Wearin? only your pride

Highways and freight trains

Drivers with no names

Well you played such a god game it was easy to ride


With a Poor Man?s scheme and

Rich Man?s dream

You ran for your life

Over El Rio into Laredo it was do or die

The stars hung bright on the other side


Well I offered a cold beer

And I said you could stay here

I swallowed my own fear

'cause I knew what was right

We spoke in a language that was

Here before Cambridge

Colored bright terracotta and aquamarine


With a Poor Boy?s Dream and a

Rich man?s scheme

You sacrificed the warmth of your wife?s hand

Your children and homeland for a roll lof dice

A bitter slice of American Pie


Mighty walls of Jericho

Toppled by the sound of tiny feet

Trumpets sound and we will know

Just who?s sitting in the driver?s seat

Oh these walls are comin? down

Getting back to the ground

And there?ll be victory

In the sound of their defeat


Well you slept when the dawn came

So I undid the latch chain I walked

Down to the riverbank and thought about life

Just when did this happen

Was it always the fashion

Playin? just to win disregarding the price


Such a Rich Man?s scheme using

Poor Boy?s dreams

To fight the fight

How far will we go pretending we don?t know what is wrong or right

The stars hang bright on the other side


Mighty walls of Jericho

Toppled by the sound of tiny feet

Trumpets sound and we will know

Just who?s sitting in the driver?s seat

Oh these walls are comin? down

Getting back to the ground

And there?ll be victory

In the sound of their defeat
