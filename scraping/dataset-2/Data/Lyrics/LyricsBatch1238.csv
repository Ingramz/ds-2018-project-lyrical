Ulster Orchestra,"Má fhághaimse sláinte as fada bhéas	 
Tráchtadh ar an méid do bháthadh as Anach	 
'S mo thruagh amárach gach athair's máthair	 
Bean as páiste tá ag sileadh súl	 
 	 
Ach lá chó breá leis gan ghaoith ná baisteach

Ulster Orchestra,"She'll come at dusky first of day
White over yellow harvest's song
Upon her dewy rainbow way
She shall be beautiful and strong
The lidless eye of noon shall spray
Tan on her ankles in the hay
Shall kiss her brown the whole day long

I'll know her in the windows tall

Above the crickets of the hay
I'll know her when her odd eyes fall
One May-blue, one November-gray
I'll watch her down the red barn wall
Take down her rusty scythe and call
And I will follow her away
I will follow her away",August,2003

Ulster Orchestra,"Then in the lull of midnight
Then in the lull of midnight, gentle arms
Lifted him slowly down the slopes of death
Lest he should hear again the mad alarms
Of battle, dying moans, and painful breath

And where the earth was soft for flowers we made
A grave for him that he might better rest
So spring shall come and leave it sweet arrayed
And there the lark shall turn her dewy nest",Midnight,2003
Ulster Orchestra,"He shall not hear the bittern cry
In the wild sky, where he is lain
Nor voices of the sweeter birds
Above the wailing of the rain

Nor shall he know when loud March blows
Thro' slanting snows his fanfare shrill
Blowing to flame the golden cup
Of many's the upset daffodil

Soon the swallows will be flying south
The winds wheel north to gather in the snow
Even the roses split on youth's red mouth
Will soon blow down the road all roses go

But when the dark cow leaves the moor
And pastures poor with greedy weeds
Perhaps he'll hear her low at morn
Lifting her horn in pleasant meads

Soon the swallows will be flying south
The winds wheel north to gather in the snow
Even the roses split on youth's red mouth
Will soon blow down the road all roses go",Where All Roses Go,2003
Ulterior Motive Orchestra,"From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

I've seen places, faces
And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say ""No""

To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I'd fly to you
From Russia with love",From Russia With Love,1996
Ulterior Motive Orchestra,"When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did

Ulterior Motives,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ultima Thule,"As I walk alone, I wonder
What went wrong without our love
Our love that was so strong
And as I still walk on I think of
The things we've done together
While our hearts were young

Tears are falling and I feel a pain

Ultimate,"I saw you laughin' at pictures in magazines,
starlings from way back when you were a kid
and like everyone did you worshipped them till the end
Then two albums later came short-haired invaders
and Flannel kicked Leather's ass
You cursed what you knew was once to be true
and tried to light Metal with gas
And the Poseurs are now laughing
as the Circle of Fads spins again
and now you dress like my old math teacher
Starling - I remember Metal Kings
Starling - Don't forget the Metal Kings
Hey, were you guessin' that this history lesson
would not have a chapter for me?
Yes it's true, I'm not terribly cool
but I don't have a plan to be
All the new Poisons just have different toys
and they all play their part perfectly
Albeit cooler, my Rockathon Ruler measures a small victory
Nothing's ever wrong that's real
And fakebooks can't show you how to feel
But it's over for me on the day my stomach's full

And we'll just laugh and forget what year it is",All the New Poisons,1998
Ultimate,"Do ya think we need it
Do ya think we feed it
Does its stomach growl when we ring those bells?

Down to brand new skin?

The circus tent is in town
I always thought it would end
Feelin' like it's the worst it's been
But you know, that's okay

'Cause I believe she said
""I want you to know that
Time turns into laughter
And we'll be fallin' faster.""

So that's all it costs to play,
But I'm not sure I'll ever see the day
I'm not confused

Did ya see his daring
Did ya feel like screamin'
Did it make you see the horror in a dream?
Can ya feel the fiction

The myth and my mission
To steal this bag of clowns
And join the Freak Parade?

Surrender - will you marry me?
Ever after - what does it mean?

[Chorus]
I don't feel like being alone, but I still don't know
But I'm just asking myself,
'Cause how's a diamond ring supposed to know

Don't insist it's all an awful bliss
You can't pretend like it isn't all that bad
Or did you miss...
How every time I get to see her she's just about to leave
And it looks like Halloween is still here on Christmas Eve

Surrender - will you marry me?
Ever after - what does it mean?

I don't feel like being alone, but I still don't know
Is a diamond ring just a shiny stone?
And I've felt like this for a long time, and I know it shows
But I'm just asking myself,
'Cause how's a diamond ring supposed to know

And by the time I figure it out
I'll probably be about the age of fifty-three
So now you've noticed how tight to my youth I cling,
Yeah, well no one said we have to let go easily

Ultimate,"Crank the amps and light the mixer
Let's fix the drummer's chair
The cooks are here to wreck the kitchen
While they sit and stare, let's take the dare

Concern about this girl I'm turnin' - this girl
This girl could eat my time up lovely
Or this girl could swallow me

[Chorus]
Do I dare? Do you care? Do I dare to
Write this song?
Do I dare? Do you care? When it's all there
The world stops turnin', engine's burnin'

Class dismissed, don't pay attention
Throw your notebooks in the air
Yeah, school is in, but did we mention
Today's the science fair - be sure you're there

Concern about this girl's allegiance - this girl
This girl could be your best friend one day
And this girl could up and leave

Ultimate,"Isn't it funny, to live for someone else's script
You spend a lot of money to catch that lift
And isn't it good too, to not always get all that you want
But we'll be singin' 'boo hoo hoo' if great it's not

'Cause everybody wants it so much better
Than anyone could ever let it be
I guess I should get off it or whatever
But please comfort me...

[Chorus]
George Lucas, is the Force with us?
Will it save us from heartbreak in 1998?

Demons with the cat claws threaten us with their fake grace
But angels without wings can't take their place
And if it's just a smart bomb in a theater far, far away
Well, we'll be singin' 'woo hoo hoo, oh man that's great!'

'Cause I never thought that this could happen,
That I could ever feel this way again
I know it's kinda dumb but it dosen't matter,
I can't hold it in

You probably figured so what,
it's late and we can fight another night
I miss you a ton and I doubt you know
I still don't like to be away too long

But still, when I call you it just feels all wrong,
'Cause if I try to talk...

Well, I'm still the one who's gone, still the one who's gone
Feels like I'm having too much fun
And I'm still the one who's gone, still the one who's gone
Feels like I'm having too much fun

I know you didn't call, but maybe the thought scared you
You figured I'm with someone else now

But I wish you would call me-
I'd tell you how I want so much for you to come along

And I will when I call you -

Ultimate,"I'm down to no more patience
Lack of sentiment life raft
Sit down, the large heart slave will see you now
Don't try to play it all down around me

You know I see right through enough
Not to take it all the time
All said, I really don't care
All said, I really don't see at all

How that's the way I feel about you, too
I'll stand down again
And maybe if I see it fall
I'll find I really don't care at all

Ultimate,"""No, I don't,"" I tell her tongue
I tell her, still I drink it all

And she keeps her eyes at the jukebox
On the needle 'til it falls

Summer doll, my will's so low
See her laughing on her own
See her dancing all alone, again
Tell my thoughts I will go home
Singing like a drunken dove
Dreaming like a bum in love again

Somewhere down her silver song
I saw her turn and gently gave around
My dumb eyes caught hers on me
Then she turned her heels

We'll never go, 'cause we couldn't talk
This silver date slips into the somber
Waitress' last call

We're comin' to town, tell me are ya nervous?
You won't see us
Familiar sight, she's drunk and drivin' round in circles
Held up to the light while we were out there
Out in the nowhere
You won't see us
The color of our younger years 
Invisible suits us fine
You won't see us
The color of those seventeen years,
Leavin' gave me quite a smile

Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical
Hella cold, I'm a gonna be off in hell old

Plus it's hard to focus, when you crooked and hopeless
I ain't home, but my mama don't notice
Nationwide with thugs, locked out it's just us
With the Feds and the police out to bust us

I'm gonna crack up and smoke with a corona

We're boxin' up for one- be on the run.
You'll find. this happens all the time.
Just wash it down with lies, and drive.

when we finally see sunshine, we'll be rottin' on the vine..

dear sirs, excuse me if that burns.
But when I heard those last few words, my stomach turned.
By side of mind, brothers first in line
We will get to you.. next time.

when we finally see sunshine, we'll be rotting on the vine.

but we're not alone.. 
But we're rotting on the vine (X2)

Another day to celebrate
Your beauty and your mystery

A reflection of You in all that I do
Lord, let me be, a light for Your truth
Light of the world, I wanna be used to shine for You

As simple as a passing smile
Or listening a little while
To someone that's convinced that they are in this all alone

But, here's my chance to share the news
To introduce the good that's You
Here You go again, You never cease to blow my mind

Lord, let me shine, shine like the moon
A reflection of You in all that I do
Lord, let me be, a light for Your truth
Light of the world, I wanna be used to shine for You

You lift us up to our feet
You hold the key to eternity

Just like the ones in the catalog.
Gonna show her how much I lover her 
Let her know that one way or the other,
Our love's gonna be written down in history

Wonder what to morrow's gonna really bring.
If I don't find work tomorrow
It's gonna be heartaches and sorrow,
Our love's gonna be destroyed by a tragedy

Things have been so hard 
and looking out 
Through your broken heart

He knows every star in the sky 
Every single tear that you cry 
His love is here faithful and alive 
I know that this world can be cold 
In his arms you're never alone 
That's his promise to you and I 

When hope had disappeared 
And you heart aches 
You might not recognize 
The touch of grace 
But on the other side 
Of every dying dream 
His love is waiting patiently 

[Chorus]

With every angel there's a love 
That never leaves your side 
His love is deeper than the ocean 
Or a mountain high 
You've got to know 
There's hope in your heart 
And if you listen with your heart 
I know you'll hear him say 
You are my child and I am with you

Drunk my brew, you started rappin soundin doo-doo

The fattest, MC of the era, cause terror
Could niggaz fuck with this? Never, but however
Many foes try to apprehend, they can't comprehend
Cause when they step to me they don't win
I bend, break MC's who fake the funk
Leavin wack rappers in the back of my truck
Then eat some rat poison and I drink some ammonia
Came out bein that gastric felonious

Fuck around with Dog and get slammed like a sumo

Shoot you from your head to your toe
You have so many holes in your shit it spells act like you know

Well I thought you knew motherfuckers..
Now take a second while I reveal myself into the industry
By smokin lyrical chokin teacher provokin MC
Clear the way for me, unique, delete the weak
As I defeat the claim to be sweet, by keepin it street
Lazy poet and I don't got to have them tactics to turn fake rappers
And crack addicts, tell the weak hit from my bomb shit
Ooooh! Damn, no stress or contest, the impossible
I stand on top of them, no doubt about it, I'm unstoppable
Got a train of focus, e'ry track I smoke this
Cannabis is nice, six I'm causin a ruckus
You can't fuck with us, known for keepin it true
Not fakin the funk like bustaz, so what you gonna do?
I address, I'm better than fresh
Mo' potent than stress, now try to test, nigga!

My bald head super sharp, I walk like Telly Savales
Niggaz on a tightrope, they style is off balance
Hyper mental like Larry Davis on the instrumental
Rappers actin poodle, but I'ma drop the kennel
No threats; don't sleep on me you slept on Bernard Goetz
With a Berkowitz twist, your projects heard of this
My unique style retarded, kids smell the piss
With hand grenades I cut your rectum out with razor blades
Emergency please, gorillas bleedin through they knees
My style werewolf - AOWWWWWWWWWW!
I howl on your elevator, open your door, see you late
I drop sticks of dynamite, open your mailbox
Don't look for guns, I paid some crackheads for yo' glocks

You could never be classic, your rappin skill's plastic

I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past

'cause it's the, ice water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you

Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas
[Incomprehensible] dead with a punctured liver
Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja
Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister

Eh yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Yo I keep my gun on me, what the fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all touch my property somebody gon' die, uh huh
This ain't no joke, it's for real, my niggas they totin' they steel
All it takes is a phone call and they ready to ride

Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the hell, the gates is open
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?

Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple

Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries

Keep it genetic, or dead it, ice water inc we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach

Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em dead in the club
And let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?

Eh yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Yo we wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Egyptian look, gazelles on, L's lit, this how it's goin' down
Ski mask, channel shit, move like a terrorist click
Nineteen eighties babies, worldwide, ya girl on our dick

All you know is Rae look good, he hood, envision the flips
I make money like them niggas who take money
Fresh out the can, Duran look, astro van
The ill Castro, rap son of Sam

More rugers, more bow and arrows still no losers
Forty five dollars ahead, I go at niggas shootin' lyrical leads
Stop absorbin', break shit knock that gay shit out ya head

Wyld in da club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club

a struggle to stay humble and trust
big trouble, in little me, causing complications
I run from confrontation, observations made from a distance
my defense to resist, I'm not convinced
that all my silhouettes can co-exist, so I drift

But I can explain how it holds its power.
Remember every dream that kept you in your sleep,
The places you would go, you've never been,
And everywhere we go, everything we do, 
Soon it all becomes a part of you.
When wishing on your star,
Remember who you are,
So why don't you just....

É como ter a mãe na zona
Você sabe que ela não presta
E ainda assim adora essa gatona
Não que eu tenha nada contra
Profissionais da cama
Mas são os filhos dessa dama
Que você sabe como é que chama
Filha da puta
É tudo filho da puta
É uma coisa muito feia
E é o que mais tem por aqui
E sendo nós da Pátria filhos
Não tem nem como fugir
E eu não vi nenhum tostão
Da grana toda que ela arrecadou
Na certa foi parar na mão
De algum maldito gigolô
Filha da puta
É tudo filho da puta
'Cês me desculpem o palavrão
Eu bem que tentei evitar
Mas não achei outra definição
Que pudesse explicar

Aquilo tudo que a gente sente

É tudo filho da puta
Sent By Carlos André Branco
",Filha Da Puta,2005
Ultraje a Rigor,"Meus dois pais me tratam muito bem
(o que é que você tem que não fala com ninguém?)
Meus dois pais me dão muito carinho
(então porque você se sente sempre tão sozinho?)
Meus dois pais me compreendem totalmente
(como é que cê se sente, desabafa aqui com a gente!)
Meus dois pais me dão apoio moral
(não dá pra ser legal, só pode ficar mal!)

Mama mama mama mama
(papa papa papa papa)

Minha mãe até me deu essa guitarra
Ela acha bom que o filho caia na farra
E o meu carro foi meu pai que me deu
Filho homem tem que ter um carro seu
Fazem questão que eu só ande produzido
Se orgulham de ver o filhinho tão bonito
Me dão dinheiro prá eu gastar com a mulherada
Eu realmente não preciso mais de nada

Meus pais não querem
Que eu fique legal
Meus pais não querem
Que eu seja um cara normal

Não vai dar, assim não vai dar
Como é que eu vou crescer sem ter com quem me revoltar
Não vai dar, assim não vai dar
Pra eu amadurecer sem ter com quem me rebelar",Rebelde Sem Causa,2005
Ultramagnetic MC's,"I'm like Cato, my rhyme's the Green Hornet
You know you want it, rappers get up on it
I flaunt it, throughout the metro-politan
The world's my area

Dance interior, fresh interior decorated
A painted wall with rhymes
That glow and show the biter slow reciter
Up who mighta tried to copy this style

Or change their ways, to wonder if you can
Take me out, on the microphone
I'm strong like Benzine, I kill a fiend
Rhymes in my tank, brains pumpin gasoline

Out, I use Exxon
And any rappers wack, my mind checks on
Meters and gauges, crankin up lyrical engines
Now I'm ready to roll

On you and him, your whole crew
Let's film it, now take two
Watch the movie, your brain will be the star
Thoughtless, when I take you far

To the galaxy, and leave your domepiece
In the hemisphere, now you're lost on Jupiter
Your brain revolves around, you get stupider
Tryin to think, where you're goin

On other planets, rhymes are flowin
Through the Milky Way, quicker than warp speed
Brains I feed with heatable rays
Ain't it good to you?

I'm a wise man, prophet of the bible
You wanna try me, then I'm liable
To go and flow and show, don't you know
Edgar Allan Poe, could not write like this

Mysteries, with a twist
And I insist, to uplift my metaphor
Slice dice and write, and make the brain sore
For, you and him

I kill a rapper, then begin
To wrote and smoke you're chokin then provoke
The joke the most, and walk around like notes
Programmed, you're equal to a dummy

Them want rhyme?  You do summies
Backwards, forwards, sideways
Anyway, I say hold it
Now you're in space, plus you're folded

Up, like molecules of matter
Plus you scatter, you wish you had a
Chance to shake, recuperate, recreate
The brain cells, I have ate

Scraped, soak em in solutions
Like Benzine, iodine producin
Student of Cee's, tryin to be, just like me
Ced Gee, the Ultramagnetic

A scientist, skilled with knowledge
Once a God, years of college
Accumulated, my wisdom and wit
Thoughts float, ideas are legit

To fit, the rhythm of the tempo
Also, the music more so
Have to move groove soothe and lose you
Now ain't it good to you?

Once again my rhyme blows up enemies
Wack MC's, across the nation on rotation
You get the hype at the station
Promotion, I put your brain in slow motion

Like lotion, and let it float in the ocean
Then I drown it, your brain begins to bubble
I bring trouble, hang with Barney Rubble
In Bedrock, and watch another head rock

Go through West to Washington and Ced block
The Avenue, passin you, bashin you
In your face, rhymes are crashin you
On the chrome dome, swellin your Astrodome

You're in an ambulance, I'm takin you home
To complete the ways I'm on a mission
I see your balls of clay with x-vision
I'm a scientist, your satellites are weak

They get dimmer every time I speak
On my gryoscope you hope to seek the style
That copacetically, bugs you out
On the mic, Kool Keith in a spaceship

Risin, not followin, plexin
Muscle flexin, lyrics for connection
Rhyme injection, rhythm perfection
Brain selection, has protection

My reflection, shines
Triple times your eye, invisible
I get by your brain
Now ain't it good to you?

Ah-yo Keith, how you say?
Just another Boogie Down Bronx Ultramagnetic sure shot
Done at the Ultra lab of course
Mixed at D&D with my man Andy

Ultramagnetic MC's,"[Kool Keith]
Well I'm the equalizer, known to be graphic
I clear static, breakin up traffic
Move, while I enter the groove
I'm on top, and happy to prove
to wack MC's who claim to be better than
No way I'm frankly more clever than
all of you, each and every one, my son
Pay close attention
I take your brain to another dimension
Hold it, mold it, shape it
You got a knife, yes I wanna scrape it
up and down, sideways, any way I can
be rude to you
But I'll rap and be crude to you
And eat up, toy ducks I beat up
I am the oven your brains I wanna heat up
Mega, supersonic degrees
I come around, roastin MC's
with fire, to burn the toy liar
Raw meat, turn the flame higher
Cook it, like a fish I'll hook it
For any beat, it's time that I took it
right, correctly to the top
with the rhythm and as your head bop
I'm hype, for the critical beatdown!

[Ced Gee]
I'm attacking them, my job is stacking them
For every rapper, must I be smacking them
once, or twice in the face
With rough beats, producin the bass
that blow out, cause power to go out
Inner spark, I'm ready to blow out
like this, altitude level
Reachin forth, stompin every devil
in sight, you might just wanna bite
My illusions, mental confusions
You're a mark, skulls I've been abusin
Losin, any rapper who follow me
Your girl loves me, now she wanna swallow me
Back up, move on to the rear
When I'm on the stage should be clear
Speakin, goin ear to ear
Places far, ducks would appear
for the countdown, so you wait to rhyme
and twist, stuttering, uttering
Parkay, margerine, everything butter
and another thing, you shoulda been a Muppet
A toy boy, a fake scream puppet
I'm takin titles, and punks better up it
to me, Ced Gee on the mic, and I'm hype
for the critical beatdown!

I am the teacher, preaching what makes sense
Class, you wasn't able to pass
For any germ or lice who come last
I'm boric, high computing acid
Get off the mic and won't you please pass it
to me, for a one-two check
Give me a pound and lots of respect
No hands, you dissapointing my fans
You on reverb, and talking to cans
Hello - how are you doing?
I come to wreck, and parties I'll ruin
with rhymes, pumpin up smoke
Diesel advances makin them choke
and cough up, the hard-headed I'll soften

[Cool Keith]
I'm ready
And now it's my turn to build
Uplift, get swift, then drift
Off, and do my own thing
Switch up
Change my pitch up
Smack my bitch up, like a pimp
For any rapper who attempt to wear Troop's
And step on my path
I'm willing as a A-1 General
Rhyme Enforcer 235 on a rhyme test
Whatever group or vest in line
I put 'em all behind
Play MC Ultra as a warning sign of my 
Skill, and what my mind deserves
I smell a grape in the duck preserves
And who deserves the right to be king of the screen
And shout wack poetry
What, are you buggin'
Germs that want to law me
Quit it, before I heat your ear off
Let your burn deduct another year off rappin'
For a face I'm slappin'
Gimme applause when hands start clappin'

Well I'm first to rock, Moe Luv's the disc jock
By my side and wit the mix
?Clyde? scratches, mathces, all cuts combine
The faster master, more quicker than the grand
Peep his hand going back and forth
North, wit the fader, smooth
?Peeking this? watch where the needle can groove
And move and lose it trying to bite
His fingers are ? as I ride the skills
Of a champ, the vamp, blow watts in the amp
And stamp your brain, as I ride and glide and hide
Moe Luv is on the mix tonight, Moe Luv

Ok, now Moe is on the mixer
So get ready, cuz here's another twister
About the way he gets the crowd to move
And groove and dance to the things he do
And prove the way he sway and lift and shape
And rock hard, all night he's on and on
Swiftly slicing, cuts are nice and smooth like rice and
Beans, another cut rises
Moe surprises more than one
2, 3, 4, 5, the jam packed crowd
Of biters and writers
Accumulating reciters observing
Cuts from the master as I move faster
Pass the wack DJs
Going on, flowing on, smooth and sailing on

[Kool Keith]
Now here's a funky beat, my rhyme is updated
For soft ducks, I played it once
A biter jumped on it
Girls got stupid, freaks humped on it
And from the back, I pumped on it
mostly, with skill, top finesse
East to West, but I guess, I'm right
while others are wrong
Tryin to teach, and usin my song
along, with your wiggedy-wack
Stay back, get back, sit back down
and think about it, whenever you're dissin me
You are the roach, the six legs wishin me
and pushin me, steadily on
Metaphor, better for, psychin more
On my tour, brains are sore
I'll be sure, I'm fresher
So tell me how I..
duck, wack rappers around
In town, never wearin no boots
Toy Bally, sharkskin suits
Rip a story, and threw his auditory
Canal Street, is my territory
For gold glory, reachin my hand
to smack rappers, and makin em stand outside
waitin for me, to tell them, my secret style
And show them, how really it's done
My son, now I'm back to you
And if you're bad I'll smack you too
A glass of rhymes, shattering

Hello!  I'm back again
It's Ced Gee, the champion
of knowledge and wisdom over all topics
I'm the chief, the general prophet
Topping, all the ducks who are delerious
about rhymin, I'm more serious
Like this, with twists as changes
I took time, and rearranged this
style like how versatile you ask me now wow
I'm like ??
The movie, you seen on TV
I'll be numerous, but believe me
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, maybe
Sealed and delivered, by me
The manufacturer
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya
And if ya run, I have to damage ya
mentally, by using my mind
Choosing adjectives hard to define
in rhymes, a dictionary wordpiece
From the Brainiac, I blew your domepiece
open, hopin you'll say to me
""That was dope,"" like an anatomy
operation on the turntables
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled
Equipped, with a white handkerchief
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this
Ultra smoker, dope man, no joker
With the line I wrote, and I quote them
Cause I'm feelin' it!

Now I be the headbanger, releasin' more anger

Check it out, one time
My tricky tricky style is so cocky I knock you out like I'm Rocky
And then I'll bet you the world, plus some loot, on the point
A licky lethaler rapper cause my rhymes are like potion
I think he burn like ?, to put your mind in slow motion
Simply, it's done, like makin a bungee
You lick it or roll it a sticky spark with the fellas
Let's contact Quinton, they call him the chief
Plus I'm votin destruction, on suckers they're nerds
Take their style toss it up, then add effects like a reverb
Take it and match it, cause the flow is exceptional
The Washington Congress, the House and Congressional
Professional, call it geronimo
Frequencies on the mickie, watch your girl give a hickie
Now you're flippin the ill way, diluted with ?

The right manage gonna be in the game

It's the top of the ninth
Josh Gibson is at the plate
The bases are loaded, it's a three and two count
And here's the pitch

Steppin' up to the plate, first batter

Cool Keith

Black baseball, it was a known fact jack
With the weather so hot, who could play like Danny Day
The greatest and the best, like the Satchel brother Paige
Long Tom and Little Bomb, in the Hall of Fame
Like Josh and bunt, be alert, duck
Everybody was down for beer and peanuts
Foxes in their Sunday's best, their brightest dress

And on deck, Ced G

Now baseball today troop, is mostly not racial
But back in the days it was all segregated
The whites had the majors and then the blacks had the negro leagues
They both had great talent but then us blacks have no history
Of all our great players, the teams in the ballpark
But we're here to shed light, restore the glory they haven't got

Black baseball, they paved the way
With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day
Black baseball
Black baseball
Black baseball

Bring er home

Now the ballparks they played in was very far from a stadium
They only sat hundreds troops as opposed to the thousands
But the stands they was packed, for the league that was fat
With teams like the Baccarats and the Homestead Grays
The Eagles and many more, came ready to play
In cities like Birmingham, Newark and Chi-Town
The bus trips were very long, paychecks would bring a frown
But not to these players, cause they really loved baseball
You could ban them from majors, but not from the game
With players like Leon Day, who pitched almost every day
His arm would hold up, blowin hitters with smoke away
And then there was Bullet Joe, also was Smokey Joe
King Richard and Savateen, and brothers like Ed Pole
Next, batter up!

Bring it home Keith!

They took the long great line that was so fine
Super and strong to play, three games a day
Hey hey, Thunder Twins are up and gonna win again
Make the other players say ""Oh him again!""
But whattya know?

Black baseball (baseball) they paved the way
With players like Dandy, the Devil, and Day
Black baseball (baseball)
Black baseball (baseball)
Black baseball (baseball)

Poppa Bell was Cool, broke any catcher's rule
On the base, at night, total speed rip the light
Comin' past flick flash he was so fast
Scouts watchin' in awe at what they saw
The best in the game, it's a shame, you don't know
Alex and Double Duty, and don't forget Juty
Talent was there, and it was black

Give them their credit folks, and build em a hall of fame
Where legends can rest, with uniforms and the whole shebang
And honor the players, coaches fans and the ballparks
From the Giants or Phillies, to the New York like Yankees
The Pittsburgh Crawfords, yeah they don't have to thank me
Just thank the Red Bull's, just thank the Abe Manley's
Just thank Rufus Lewis, a few names that grab me

One thing, two things, like ? blow casey

Let's see babe grim and his exoskeleton
He's pitchin a fastball, you swing and you miss
But seven times away clown, you're smellin the piss
Drippin offa your forehead, rollin down to new mexico
You're caught in a bid troop, you thought you was flexible
X-able, montreal expos
Hypodermic you turn it, you pick it up and you learn it
Now you're chillin with zinc as it kicks with the sodium
Pele came down just to sign some autographs
He laughed and he left, went to el segundo
For cheese and some bacon my philadelphia steak 'em
I got a hole in my pants, i said, ""asalaam alaikum""
Got a new jacket was breakin out to the trainin camp
I danced and danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced.. then i sat on the toilet!
Wrote a rhyme and then ordered, now i'm spinnin and winnin
Got the girlies up on it, cause i'm kickin and stickin
Finger-poppin and lickin, can you do me a favor
Can you go get the chicken - as you see we're a legion

On the microphone holding my own ground
Dominating forces
Change the sources, punks takes losses
Enough cause it's me on the mic
Feeding on words, small like a nerd
Haven't you heard this change of rhyme
Continuing the land of time
For my incredible, highly elevated
Smooth in the mind, more sophisicated
Motivated, as I relate it verbal
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbel
I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo
Shining, fog lights in the front
I'm by myself, no seats for a stunt
'Cause I want it like that, I got it like that
I have it like, I need it like that
It's better like that, I made it like that
I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes
Like an amateur but I'm a 20 year veteran
And better than, including the rest of them
I chew 'em all and spit out the best of them
One by one, I'm teaching my son
To ease back
Ease back

I'm Seth G wit a funky blend
Of beats and rhymes on time wit my DJ
He's not weak wit anything he plays
Rocking, slicing, rep is treacherous
Like a professor, he had perfected this
Simple potion, through devotion
Wit his blends, his motions and fastly approaching
Coasting, reaching higher levels
So when you see 'em, you best say hello
I'm a take out a knife,pen and paper and write
A rhyme so dope you can't think, can't cope
Ducks, who are you really kidding
You say you're dope, well you're admitting
That you can't compete because you're rhymes are weak
Full of more nonsense, past tense, incomplete
Weap and learn a new rap style
From Seth G, the wizard of know how
An innovation, elevation, psyching the nation
When I ease back

Well I'm entering, a style that's rappable
To keep you moving, feets tappable
Fingers snap, hands are clappable
Kickin, to the ultimate sounds
And every record, it spins around
And rotate, while the rhythm motivates
I pause once, then I hesitate
Like this, twist then change it
Another rhyme I have to rearrange it
For, an easier flow on
And this rhyme I can start the show on
After you, I'm ready to go on
Damage, and properly manage
House arenas, then take advantage
Of MC's, rhyme duck wannabe's
You need rhymes? No not none of these
So keep goin, yo stop beggin please thank you
Like a baby I'll spank you
A rap inmate, you know that I'll shank you
Hard, dead in your ear
So you can hear every rhyme that's near
And far, like the Northern star
Cause I'm on..

I come hard, boostin my stamina
Skills until my rhymes are full and damage ya
With action, causin distractions
I'm the center, the main attraction
Taxin, ducks I'm waxin
I'm Ced Gee, and true to five maxin
Attackin, smackin em serious
Into a coma, and more furious
With anger, I treat you like a hanger
Hang you up, grab your girl and bang her
Hard, hard and hard
Like John Leslie, a porno star is born
You know what I'm sayin?
I keep goin while the others are prayin
That I, cut, this, rhyme, short
In order, so, they, can +Break North+
Far, out of my range
Dodgin scanners, repulsive rays
I gave, so give me some praise
Better yet -- another raise is due
To the man that's hyper
I hit this beat, just like a sniper
Shooting, aiming at a target
I never miss them, call me a Sargeant
A Corporal, a General, a higher rank
My rhymes are sharp, just like a shank
Blade, cutting through boxes
I do it good so I might as well rock this
Party tonight, live and outta site
Excite riot, light and do it right
I'm on..

[Kool Keith]
I'll take a second, but now that I'm wreckin
Don't play me close, and keep checkin
Your background, and how you sound
Dissin me, at one point pissin me
If you're a girl, another crab kissin me
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
So what I made another song with that
Incredible, skill to be vital
Hand it back, I'm housin that title
Snatch, now who's the champ again?
I said a rhyme, and blew an amp again
For you, deep in your brain
I write cool let Keith remain
Stuck, inside your domepiece
And later on, you're gonna need a chromepiece
Shield, to protect your mind
I work hard puttin parts in line
To assemble, rearrange your afro
You are the toy, made by Hasbro
Trying, the dominant moves
Pick up the wack, and count the grooves
I'm on..

[Ced Gee]
I'm like a sparkplug, made by Champion
I speak loud, I blew a cranium
With highs and bass, sputtering words and syllables
Here's the format, from the general
Speaker, Ced Gee will only teach ya
Bite my aims, and you'll get weaker
Noticin, the way I keep pace
With fast tempo, pumpin style that shakes

Spanish girls, they like to call me Pancho
On the mic, innovating this pat-ter-en
You fell off, your brain is on Sa-tur-en
Take steps, and climb my ladder-and
climb... climb, climb
Pace the rhythm, and clock the time
that I leave, come back on beat
Different, telling and selling
Like a Skyjet, plane propelling
but dwelling, deep in your skull
My rhyme shines, and yours is dull
like dirt, it hurt to be wacker
But instead, I'll grab a big stack of
wack MC's, lay em down like tile
Scrap and garbage, germs I'll pile
to keep clean, I'm a movie scene
Ears turn, and needles lean
to cut scratches, in a part that matches
I'm leavin eyes, and brains with patches

Touch my mic, rip and smile
like a duck, you know you are a soft punk
Livin pink, your material sucks
Liver and worse than you can imagine
You best run, cause I'ma put a badge in
your brain, so you can see the real time
Grab a pen, and write down my rhyme
and learn it and learn it and learn it, until it sinks
inside your skull and you're no longer pink
but red, cause now you are a biter
Learnin from me, so I guess that is Oreida
Except if you try to be the original

Sometimes I rhyme offbeat, awkward
but different with the rhythm

As we gradually slowly we'll teach
all, how to rap, I will attract
all the def girls smack the ugly ones back
and sit, as I chill, I'm drinkin Moet
Expensive champagne cause Ced Gee is a poet
Rappin and teachin, reachin levels higher
Don't wanna be king, so don't call me sire

Ripping the mic, I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer. I'm coming out like beers
Like Rheingold, Miller, Coors, and Buds

I'm a eat 'em wit popcorn and treat 'em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack, wicky, wick able wack
Black jack, that's a fact, writing exact behind your back
The funk rhyme to master, blaster

Kicking up in a brainstorm, rainstorm
Rap storm, rap form, rap time, rap rhyme
Rap class, I'm here to fail and to pass
To continue, from the more, hype tip

I roll and rock, rock and roll
Jazz and pop, rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion, pain confusion
Look at the lights, what a night on the town

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

Now I'm back to funk, freak the funk
Hype the funk, swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on 'em, communicate wit the world
Man, woman, a baby boy and a girl

Poppa large looking out the pawn shop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write learn to talk, learn to walk
And watch your step though, I'm hype and ripe though

Kleptomaniac, my rhyme is psycho
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a rag top, an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards

The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull it's card
Jack or Ace, King or Queen, call me the deuce
I'm pouring L.A. juice hitting the top, feeling the rim
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them

On and on, on and on, on and on until the break of dawn
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime, switching off to Prime time
Specifically, strolling back in the west time

Rock the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope, hype the frame, the mic is smoking
Yo, I ain't joking
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp

You're dripping sweaty, coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand

Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is loud, you can pay as the manager
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom, taking life more serious

I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight, no grams to kill more
A son of Sam, how could I begin more
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows

You're in living hell, the funk, pound to pound
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing
I'm coming out in sighting
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula

Spectacular and not irregular in fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose

That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one
Look at the master, my range is higher
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast

Pulling kids out the ground

You reply your heart of the country

Do what you can for the heart of the country

Yourself waiting for a long time
Your back's to the wall

Sucking breath from nicotine
Standing tall against the crowd we sigh

Taking turns on telephones
Living lives in other homes
Listening for the passionate replies

Suddenly we find
Ourselves talking for a long time
Our voices are low
But now you must know

Giving all you have to give
Taking all you've got to live
Plotting all mistakes along the way

Find it hard to take it all
Reading names on other walls
Writing down the words we tried to sing

Yourself waiting for a long time
Your back's to the wall

To step in time and play the part
With velvet voices smooth and cold
Their power games a game no more
And long the chance to use it

Can you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?
Too many memories are waiting in your bed

Laugh like a maniac, walk like a king too

Ripped suit, zip boots, dancing like an insect

The city's pretty dead but the nights are still alive

Ultravox,"I took a walk down New York avenue
Wearing my latest disguise
Enjoying the perfume of utter dismay
I was effectively anesthetized

Nagasaki in our own coats

Up on the streets

I swagger like a neon guitar

Like a sheet from over me

Just a flicker and the crowd moves on

In winter
Overcoats close in
And the snow tastes of tin
On the steps of any station

I'd like to glide in the long green light
Of a July afternoon
Sliding down a vague conversation

Because I
I can't stay long
When the moment comes
Just a glance and the glance is gone

Watch closely
As a man with a hat
And a girl with a map
Synchronise with the track
And they go away

I need to drift through all the walls
And let the scenery dissolve
Into some other life

You're the man who dies every day
You're the man

We never saw you walk in, we never saw you leave
You flick the ashes off a lap on everybody's sleeve
You always play that funny pack of cards without an ace
And every street you ever walked is mapped out on your face

You're the man who dies every day
You're the man

You always kept a sunset behind your lonely shoulder
You never showed on photographs and you never grew much older
You flicker like a shaky shadow, moving like a thief
You never drop your facade and you never seek relief

I asked him the time, but when he turned around,
I saw it wasn't him at all.
I'm still searching.

You reply your heart of the country

Do what you can for the heart of the country

And those who laugh will surely fall
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall

Shed light upon their stolen life
They drive by night and act as if they're moved by unheard music
To step in time and play the part
With velvet voices smooth and cold
Their power games a game no more
And long the chance to use it

It looked as if, it were taken in the forties sometime,
Judging by the style.

He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane,
Perhaps he died in a car crash, years ago.
Right now, it's impossible to tell.

I almost thought I saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge.
I asked him the time, but when he turned around,
I saw it wasn't him at all.

I'm still searching.
I'm still searching.

I saw him in an airport, while he was sitting on a wing.

A whole world crying
Looking for something to say
We had it all and we threw it all away
Is there somebody watching
Somebody watching over the mess that we've made
We're lost and alone and afraid

Freezing breath on a window pane

A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful

It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me

Haunting notes, pizzicato strings

Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky

I see it every day
As children play
There's a future, watching, waiting
No-one can deny
The reasons why
We are hurting
Much more than believing
You're deceiving with all these bitter lies

I've just got to let you know this time
That we've seen through your disguise
Politically motivated total mind control
Just as I predicted
The innocent grow stronger through it all

Chorus:

It's no lie, it's a revelation
Open your eyes to the revelation

Visions in your mind
Unfolding in our time
There's a new world out there calling
We are justified
Almost hypnotised
We are leading
Somehow we are changing
Rearranging the lexicon of life

And there's nothing left to change this time
Here we all stand unified
Together we have motivated absolute control
And just as I imagined
We all realised we had it all

Side by side, to the revelation
Open your mind to the revelation

Yourself waiting for a long time
Your back's to the wall
But now you must go

Painting scenes from magazines
Sucking breath from nicotine
Standing tall against the crowd we sigh

Taking turns on telephones
Living lives in other homes
Listening for the passionate replies

Suddenly we find
Ourselves talking for a long time
Our voices are low
But now you must know

Giving all you have to give
Taking all you've got to live
Plotting all mistakes along the way

Find it hard to take it all
Reading names on other walls
Writing down the words we tried to sing

Suddenly you'll find
Yourself waiting for a long time
Your back's to the wall
But now you must go

Suddenly you'll find
Yourself waiting for a long time

Locked in the wishing well
While bird song gourmets dragged empty nets
I slumbered in my shell

Glowing lonely in the night
With all the pornographers
Burning torches beneath the sea

And a crumbling fugue of songs
From the reservoir of video souls
In the lakes beneath my tongue
In flesh of ash and silent movies
I walked at boulevards again
A nebula of unfinished creatures
From the lifetimes of my friends
I hope your innocence has depraved me

[Chorus:]

Broadcast me, scrambled clean
Or free me from this flesh
Let the armchair cannibals take their fill
In every cell across wilderness
We'll trip such a strangled tango
We'll waltz a wonderland affair
Let's run to meet the tide tomorrow
Leave all emotion dying there

Ultravox,"Enter me gently
I break in the light
Cover my eyes
With the rags of my life

Was I dreaming?
Or did you say
""The frontiers are falling
It's time to be slipping away
Let's slip away, let's slip away""

All things fall from me
The bonds and the veils
All things blow by me
My sorrows have sails

Was I dreaming?
Or did you say
""The empires are fading
It's time to be slipping away
Let's slip away, let's slip away""

What am I to do? Don't leave me
What is there to say? I really

We're just wasting time
Let the night takes its place
Color my eyes
With the dusk of this wonderful day
Let's slip away, let's slip away

Letters from lovers
Are lining my grave
Some came too early
And some came too late

Were you speaking?
Or did I say
""The frontiers have fallen
It's time to be slipping away""

""As you call me
My hands they fall open
My mouth, it is frozen
The [Incomprehensible] stumbles
I'm falling slow-motion, dissolve""

Ultravox,"Walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until

The feeling has gone only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

The music is weaving
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance

The image has gone only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me

Ultravox,"We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died along, a long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face

For far too long, I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye, dry eyes, I've watched your 'plane fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone

Chorus:
There's no regrets
No tears goodbye
I don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

In these our private lives.
We dance 'til dawn,
As they beat the drums,

Stories and lies

I can hear you crying out behind your paper smile

Won't give you strength to talk to me at all

Senza di lei
Non potrei senza una speranza",Notte Rosa,
Umberto Tozzi,"Come cresce bene il nostro amore
Non lo voglio abbandonare
Questo timido germoglio
Pelle di velluto non ti sveglio io
Con il freddo della brina
Penseresti ad un addio
Vado solo a prendere i vestiti
E ad uccidere il passato, ora ci sei tu

Donna amante mia
Donna poesia
Scoiattolo impaurito ti scaldai
Ed al mattino tu eri donna
Se perdessi te
Vinto me ne andrei
Sarebbe troppo e forse troppo sei
Ma dormi ancora un po', io ritornerò
Com'è difficile spiegare
Ad una donna la sua parte
Quando tu la vuoi lasciare
Lei mi sfiora il corpo e dentro muore
Come è triste far l'amore se non è con te

Donna amante mia
Donna dell'addio
Scoiattolo impaurito che farai
E chi si accorgerà che sei donna
Io ti cercherò
Dolce amante mia
Ma ti conosco, mi dirai di no
E qui sulla tua porta io ci morirò
Io ti cercherò
Dolce amante mia
Ma ti conosco, mi dirai di no

Umberto Tozzi,"In questa notte di venerdì
Perché non dormi perché sei qui
Perché non parti per un week-end
Che ti riporti dentro di te

Cosa ti manca cosa non hai
Cos'è che insegui se non lo sai
Se la tua corsa finisse qui
Forse sarebbe meglio così

Ma se afferri un'idea
Che ti apre una via
E la tieni con te o ne segui la scia
Risalendo vedrai quanti cadono giù
E per loro tu puoi fare di più

In questa barca persa nel blu
Noi siamo solo dei marinai
Tutti sommersi non solo tu
Nelle bufere dei nostri guai

Perché la guerra, la carestia
Non sono scene viste in TV
E non puoi dire lascia che sia
Perché ne avresti un po' colpa anche tu

Si può dare di più perché è dentro di noi
Si può osare di più senza essere eroi
Come fare non so non lo sai neanche tu
Ma di certo si può dare di più

Perché il tempo va sulle nostre vite
Rubando i minuti di un'eternità

E se parlo con te e ti chiedo di più
È perché te sono io e non solo tu

Umberto Tozzi,"Innamorati, innamorati, innamorati
Innamorati, innamorati

Nelle terrazze d'estate al blu 
Bevendo notte e felicità 
Convinti di non morire più 
Nei lunghi inverni delle città 

Il mondo chiudono con la zip 
Carte di credito a fantasia 
E se ne fregano della SIP 
L'amore è anche telepatia 

Gli innamorati con piccoli voli 
Galleggiano un metro più sù 
E della vita si mangiano il miele 
E a noi non ne lasciano più 

Magari piangono in fondo a un film 
E poi si picchiano per la via 
O al buio lottano con i jeans 
Giocando il sesso con allegria 

Gli innamorati si inventano il sole 
Nei freddi grappini di un bar 
Ladri sfacciati di baci e parole 
Che scappano dalla realtà 

Eppure gli innamorati ci sembrano strani 
Ma lo siamo stati anche noi 
Bianchi sui prati a migliaia di mani 
E adesso non voglio e non vuoi 

Innamorati senza pietà 
Come la figlia del paradiso 
Con le tue ciglia voltate in là 
Dietro un sorriso che se ne va (se ne va )

Ma ma ma ma ma
I grandi amori non vanno via 
Come le macchie di eternità 
Lo credi tu che non sei più mia 
Con le tue ciglia voltate in là 

Gli innamorati lo sono per sempre 
E ancora lo siamo io e te 
Come poeti di fine settembre 
Un po' ci sentiamo Prevert 

Oh, gli innamorati non lasciano ombre 
Le tengono ognuno per sé 
Gli innamorati lo sono per sempre 
E ancora lo siamo io e te 

Io e te (innamorati, innamorati, innamorati)

Con gli altri insieme a me per fare la città
Con gli altri chiusi in se che si aprono al sole

I muri vanno giù
Al soffio di un'idea
Allah come Gesù in chiesa o dentro una moschea
E gli altri siamo noi ma qui sulla stessa via

Che ci aspettano e si chiedono 
Perché nascono e subito muoiono

E sono giorni che guardo il cielo
E non vedo il sole

Ho solo fame di una giustizia che ormai mi ha rotto

Non voglio più non ci provare più
A soffocare il grido no
Ed io lo so che anche se dico no
Sono un privilegiato

Ma non pensare ch' io non abbia occhi
Perché ho già pagato
E proprio adesso che li alzo al cielo 
E che non c'è più il sole
Mi accorgo quanta gente piange
Per un po' d'amore

Ah ah ah facce d'angeli luridi
Ah ah ah voi giocate con gli alibi
Come sarebbe vedere in noi
Solo sorrisi e pace

Fra di noi amor mio cancelliamo la parola addio
Servirebbe solamente se io non avessi te
Se non avessi te o se ti perderò
Io me ne andrei perché sei tutto quel che ho

Morirei finché c'è vita se io non avessi te

And one fall she stood so tall.
She found some confidence and some wings and she, she flew away.
And she said, ""you can't hold me down any longer.""

I once loved a girl named rose.
And one sunny day she began to wither
So she took a dip in the pool, felt restored.
She said, ""I hate these thorns.""

I'm trying not to disappoint.

I'm not quite sure yet 'cause we just met
Your white dress contradicts your black hair
You probably dyed it, I don't really care
You said ""Hello, do you have the time?""
Well, it's not mine to keep
It's not mine for me to keep
You smiled and you said ""Let me buy you a drink""

Well, I just can't trust a girl that does the buying
I just can't trust a girl that does the buying

You gave up smoking a few months back
Well I quit last December, and I never looked back
Let's go somewhere fresh where I can see your face
You keep touching my arm, we're gonna crash at this place
I'm hooked on something you just said
You looked so lonely, or maybe it's just me
So the medicine went down smoothly
You went through my records
And you picked the one that I would have picked
Your eyes shined up as you sat on the floor
You tipped a glass and said ""Come join me""

You looked so lonely, or maybe it's just me

All your plans had fallen through
You had ambition, and I took that too
I dethroned you
I'm now the king of this castle
And you will atone for your sins

[Chorus:]
You're always up or down but you're never around
Well, friends like you I think I'm better off without

Everyone is talking, but they all sound the same
All these singers singing, they play the same games
You're as crooked as the California coast line
So I'm building you a tornado to get back east

And maybe your fear will subside

It knows of the history here
The windows are rattling, they are cracking
The air, it just wants in
I want thunder and I want lightning
I want to be taken away
But only with my girl at my side, as we softly float away

[Chorus:]
I've found a place where I can go
Where I fit in and I forget I'm living in this town
I could drive us all around
'Cause I've found this place where we can go

So I'm just an unconscious vessel that you steer through the storm
I'm tired of being invisible, I'm tired of being forgotten

and my mind wont shut down

Through the waters of beauty and grace
We will one day dock at the same port

There is a light placed up in the sky
Like the stained glass, time slows down
I wish I could sleep, I wish I could dream

I'll laugh my eyes out, I'll feel the rhythm
I'll pretend you're the reason
To make anything and everything that is scented blossom
I'll run my fingers through your hair until your eyes blink out

All night long I laid in the grass
And listened with headphones to the saddest songs
It was a spiral of a night
You were spread out across the sky
The way you skinned your knees chasing cars
They're taking you away

I'll laugh my eyes out, I'll feel the rhythm
I'll pretend you're the reason
To make anything and everything that is scented blossom
I'll run my fingers through your hair
Until your eyes blink out",Thinking of You,2006
Umbrellas,"I saw you running through the fields
Your hair was a mess and your face was wet
Your body was trembling
The summer's heat made your clothes stick to your skin
I just didn't know where to begin
I feel like everything, it's all my fault
I just wanted you to know the truth
I'm tired of the silence
It seems all too common when things are standing still
I just can't describe what it feels like
To be on the outside looking in
So I'm searching for that song that will make me break down
And fall to my knees in the middle of this broken street
It's like life and death, they're married to each other
It's a partnership that can't be undone
I just wish there was something I could do for you
As we sit here, watching the ashes as they fall
And we fall

It shouldn't bother you at all
It could take more to overcome less in a day
No matter how you break
You shouldn't be the one to take
Your own opinions as they twist in their own way
When all she wants is to be left
Off to the side and counted with the rest
All she wants is to be spared
From voting for a candidate who doesn't care
Though many more have been provided
When the only one decided
Is someone who's left to wait
And any promise worth fulfilling
What when only one needs selling
Isn't one to leave till late

No matter how it's read
Only so much can be said
About subscribing to a point that has no ground
No matter how it feels
Your speculation isn't real
Nothing can be guaged until it comes around
When all she wants......
And though the end may seem divided
Every story is two sided
But it's only yours you'll know
And truth be told if you are willing
Then that promises fulfilling
Is what only time could show

A struggle to stand and afraid if you try
Bleeding and pleading to change what you can

Whiskey will flow until the damn runs dry

There's nowhere you're from

Compared to hear who won

Hold on Lord I can't do it with out you

Will make you all move along to a lovely beat

Got too excited, made her feel like prey
Lost her in the last phase

Still the thought's enough to make me choke again

I had a friend who couldn't sit still
He would think until his hands began to spill things
And every morning he woke up
Never thought he'd done enough the night before

And it's hard to break the habits that we make

Choked words and unfinished sentences
These never ending subtle messages of home
Trees and notes

And all roads point right back to home

You rise and shine because the virgin mother said
Legs can't walk, givin' up
Givin' up is not one of the options
Givin' up is not in the plans

I know the trip is long on the body
So don't ask it 'Where they're yet?' like a child
'Cause patience is a virtue

Sink my teeth into it
Soak my feet in the mud of my past

Umphrey's McGee,"Generous come the gift from the source as it it
When allowed make us proud run the course as it shifts
Recovered through although you always knew it was there but you withdrew
Identified and pushed aside the only message they provide

Whereabouts run north and south they're only known from the word of mouth
Escape the wheels as they conceal the way this pact is sealed

As before once was town locked away in a drawer
Glance around tie it down tightly wound to the core
No consolation can be held but all the same it's just as well
If you've heard the you deserve given words you can never sell

We wait our days still so amazed at how these parts are finally played
The system doubt our open routes we follow faithfully devout

So the source runs its course through our minds we implore
Tightly wound souls are bound as it was once before",Conduit,2011

Set it out, control your thoughts

Bet it all and be let out

All is fair on two fronts

Now it's time, time to wait
Sliding deeper into hell
Come along drift your parts

If you could, I bet you'd wait
Never see the light of day

Umphrey's McGee,"Well basically it's not what it seems
It's too late to argue with me
You think you figured out this machine
Well your way off, you're way off

If I rolled up my sleeves
You should stand back, just stand back
You'll take it if it's coming from me
You take everything from everybody

You're falling down like a stack of dominoes
Your secrete was safe, but now everybody knows
Your demeanor was cleaner but now clean just ain't enough
This unexpected, misdirected you, you don't even know that you're stuck

So I can be just one of two things
What's good for you might not be for me
As superficial as it might seem
I got my mind made up, it's made up

Time won't work you tried
He's out of town and he ain't coming back
Your provisions made you go blind
What then are you looking at

It could be charity or not I don't know
Let me off of this suggestion before you implode
Based on the pretexts of your reflexes about my complaint
You need to more than reconsider so the bigger picture never goes blank

I don't care or not if you agree
It's way to late to argue with me
Details that you're trying to see
You're all talk you're all talk

I appreciate you trying
But you're way off you're way off
I feel like I've been shopping antiques
It's the same shit, it still stinks

You're falling down like a stack of dominoes
You're secrete was safe, but now everyone knows
Your demeanor was cleaner but now clean just ain't enough
This unexpected, misdirected you, you don't even know that you're stuck

On a sidewalk
That runs into a corner
Better turn around quick
Don't say I didn't warn you

Soon or late it was bound to happen 
Faster than you'd think
You need to more than reconsider

Umphrey's McGee,"When I was young, still a kid
I was unprepared, never thought before I did
And now as I look back I can't believe it
I told lies, needed proof, I was further from the truth
So I locked myself in the corner of my room
Yeah I thought maybe my view could be better
I never knew what I did, it would all come back
I'd be forced to sift through all the misdirection
I believed in

I relied on my youth, I could make up an excuse
And collected scars, yeah, I thought that I could choose
And my way would be destined to deliver

You never have as long as you want
So don't get caught up in the
We never could take back time that we're wasting

I only hope that you've been listening
But I doubt you could repeat a thing
Yeah I've been in that seat before
It's always easy to ignore
When no one wants or needs advice
From someone they don't think is right
And just cause I've been wrong before
It doesn't mean I don't want more for

You live in the long-term world and it's hard to endure
(But ya) Do cause you've already seen and
You know the routine now
(We) Maybe could meet in the middle
It's not too difficult
(To) Cause we're both just stuck with spinning wheels

The odds aren't any easier on either side
And just because you say it doesn't make it right
Don't think I ever could repay you
But it's still my life
I hope I never have to say or go forever a day without you

(You) Live in the long-term world and it's hard to endure (But ya)
(Do) Cause you've already seen and
You know the routine now
(We) Maybe could meet in the middle

Umphrey's McGee,"There's nothing more we need
Just a little sympathy
The timing couldn't be more perfect

Wait all the time
Just to find you were blind
The future seemed so uncertain

You're life is on the wall
The books will tell ya, your friends will tell ya all
There's nothing more we lack
Just a little self respect
The timing couldn't be more perfect

Sometimes we need a change
Before we go insane
Because life can be overwhelming

To really feel the cost
Right down to your core
I'd hit the floor for you now

Umphrey's McGee,"If you had to make it matter, but you just can't find the words
When you're waiting for an answer that you've already heard
Then you're drowning in the moment 'cause you never leaned to swim
As the distance grows between the shores, you know how this could end

Are you thankful for your well wishers, who put you on your way
Or bitter 'cause your currency is lost in the exchange
So forget about your handfuls, when it's worthless you're sublime
As the sun begins to grow red you're running low on time

I have to wonder, are you stuck under clouds of possibilities?
Or can't you turn against those urges? 
They'll desert you, guaranteed
If nothing's certain then that's worse 
Than this confusion as it intrudes on you and me

If you fit into your pattern, it should come as no surprise
As it's the safest the stars that shatter you learn to be polite
So be hopeful as a candle is worried for its flame
The more that you could handle here, the less you feel the same

I have to wonder are you stuck under clouds of possibilities
Or can't you turn against those urges? 
They'll desert you, guaranteed
If nothings certain than that's worse

Umphrey's McGee,"And if you see it layin' round, it's alright to take it
It's nothin at all, and if nobody saw, who knew?
But if the circumstance is right and your mistaken
I can't determine off hand, but I'd say its quite a few
There's a serious lack of forgettable facts and who makes them
If the word makes print there's no reason to think at all
Don't be sensitive or reluctant to confession
It's obvious who's the victim half the time
Never speak too soon when an idea needs to level
That declarations can be made won't make them true
And if you don't make room in your backpack for the devil
You'll have the weight of the world lifted off your shoulders too

Now I don't mean to be misleading
And I would hate to complicate your point of view
But if you really just presume that's my impression now of you
Well there's a lot of ground to cover, and even more than we need to talk through.

Now if you haven't gone too far by now don't worry
If you're stuck in the crowd and you've been thinking out loud, I'd stop
Now I'm not suggesting here that you should hurry
But if everyone's out for theirs, can there be enough?
Don't be flustered by your falls while they're occurring
They won't be factored in to the final score at all
So if morality calls you up and leaves a message
It's always better advice, so I would listen to it more than twice

Now I don't mean to be misleading,
And I would hate to complicate your point of view
I'm only trying to pass on words you need to hear
The explanations up to you
It's not enough to just show up with only words to say

Then spinning we all collide one big typo this puppet show

I’d usually begin this conversation differently
I know it's kinda one sided
It’s obvious the answer is a question I believe
That no body’s asking

What's really below or above us

I needed someone like you

You're way off, and hypocritical

If I can recognize that this is always at most a guess
Why should I apologize for being so unimpressed?
Well maybe someday I can listen to myself but I'm not there yet
I'm only asking for a little bit of help but I'll take what I can get

You have been a sheltered fort,
To every generation.
Sanctuary from the storm,
To every generation.

Our God is an awesome God.
He reigns from heaven above,
With wisdom, power and love.
Our God is an awesome God.



",Awesome God,1996
Unashamed,"Life my life by faith alone,
Life my life for God,
He gave his only Son,
To die on the cross.
The word of God is my light,
His righteousness, my path.
To walk with God is a daily task.
There is no looking back.
When the days are endless,
When times are tough,
I turn to God for my help.
He answers with love.

Nevermind those scientists,
With their crooked lies.
Nevermind society,
With their lusty eyes.
Nevermind the faithless,
They don't understand the truth.
They're trying to decide their lives,
Without help from above.

Take away my worldly things,
Take away my life,
There's one thing you can't touch,
My faith in God.

God, I surrender all I have to you.
God, I surrender all my faith in you.
My body as a sacrifice,
I give my life to you.
God I surrender.



",I Surrender,1996

Yet you're not listening.
I give you my hand,
But you push me away.
I'm just trying to help you,
To show you the truth.
I give you my hand,
But you push me away.

Trying my hardest to help you understand,
But you keep turning your back on me,
You keep shutting me out,
You ask for respect,
Yet you give none back.
You attack my beliefs,
And the way I live.
Honest and true,
My life is not my own.
To God I give the glory,
I fall to my knees.

Feeling your pain,
You're breaking my heart.
I'm just trying to show you
What God's love is all about.

Crying out to the one,
Who will save me from this pain.
On my own, I cannot survive.
My destiny, eternal life.

Falling short of His will for me.



",Never Ends,1996
Unashamed,"I feel I am falling,
From grips of righteousness.
Trapped in sin, there's no way out.
I am weak, the walls keep building.
I feel so helpless, I feel so all alone.

Bound in chains,
The power of sin grow over me.
I try to separate,
But it can't be done.

Darkness surrounds me,
Leaving me without help.
I can't get out,
I can't find help.
I'm trapped inside my own iniquities.

But it can't be done,
Without help from above.

I keep three hoes in my room at one time
Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't want to, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfucking wood on her
Cause I perform, a G like Warren
A nigga getting paid off shooting porn
They call me the black folks President

You would want to be a part of this, oh bitch ass nigga
Quit playing with the hoe, and let me borrow the bitch

Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail

Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back

Uncle Chuce,"The problem is at the end of the day
No good things come our way
We need some kind of way
I'll hustle every day

Can you tell me what the problem is?
What the problem is
What the problem is
Wanna know what the problem is
Can you tell me what the problem is?

The problem is we all out for self
In a world that's consumed by greed and wealth
It's a dog-eat-dog and we cannibals for capital
The will to survive in an animal is natural
But the desire to rule
In the pursuit of pure power is the path of the fool
We chase crown till we laying face down
Our worldly possessions keep weighing us down
In rain clouds I move like a quiet storm
No shroud, stand proud, why should I conform?
Beyond the norm I exceed the hype
Beyond all the bullshit and the stereotypes
Throw this in your stereo, this is my life
When a day's so dark you would swear it was night
9th came with the beat to help me carry the light
So you can stand your ground whatever the fight
You work for yours like I work for mine
On some P. Rod shit, got a perfect grind
What's next from the West like I'm first in line
From the coast that's known for the surf and shine
Write rhymes like I'm trying to save the earth in time
Before my girl get big and give birth to mine
I encourage you to live, put the worst behind
Never worry about the past, it ain't worth your time

Let me start with what I know and let me put it in this flow
We got all the goods we need but got no money to grow
Hood got all the coke and weed but got no profit to show
Junkies got 
Education at an all-time low, still catch an all-time high
Off the kush Dr. Greenthumb grow
I ain't preaching, I'm just giving you a real twenty-four
It's a cold world these streets don't feel anymore
There's no way you tell it 
The people's government, the big time villains
Rob us blind, steal it, just the way it is
Take you for a gang of loot, twenty dollars got you, I ain't?
Now tell me why's that, they blame the lies in rap
But what about the medium bullshit? They disguising that
How we got access to ammo and any size of gat
But we can't get a decent school for us to knowledge at
It's called the block madness
They know they turn us into crime addicts
On the block chasing superficial status
Now do the mathematics, how many of us die in war
On the street or for all who sleep and score
The same cops you pay to protect and serve us
And the country turns it's back even though you fought for it in service
When it comes to my life it's never one problem
You never know about it till you",The Problem Is...,2010

Maybe she's waiting. She waits for night.

Last night the pale moon was shining.

Last when all was still,

I was wandering alone in sadness

Out among the woodland hills.


I heard the birds a'singing

Out among the trees and view.

And all the birds, my darling,

Were singing, were singing of you.


Were singing, were singing of you (my love).

Were singing, were singing of you.

And all the birds, my darling,

Were singing, were singing of you.


I think of you in the daytime.

I dream of you by night.

I wake and I wish you were here, love.

And tears are clouding my sight.


Those flowers that slumber so sweetly.

The stars above the blue.

Oh, heaven itself, my darling.

Is thinking of you.


Is thinking, is thinking of you (my love).

Thinking, is thinking of you.

Heaven itself, my darling,

Is thinking, is thinking of you.


I opened my window so gently,

Looked out on the dreamy view.

The whole wide world, my darling,

Was sighing, was sighing for you.


Was sighing, was sighing for you (my love)

Sighing, was sighing for you.

The whole wide world, my darling,

Was sighing, was sighing for you.

Said if you don?t bring me another quart of corn

And it?s oh, it?s a hard life

When you?re a drinker born

The only thing I ever did wrong

Was take that first sip of corn

Let it rain, let it pour
Don't know what I'm waiting for
But underneath my bed
Are the words that you once said,
Hey babe, mm,
Let's marry in the summertime

Lock up the door, throw away the key
You'll get no more love from me
When the band is playing on,
I'll be dreaming of a love long gone

I'll hang my head and cry,
I just said my last goodbye, babe",The Last Goodbye,2007
Uncle Earl,"

When I go from this life, let me go in peace

Don?t want your marble at my head and feet

Don?t gather round me oh just to weep and moan

Where that I?m going I won?t be alone


The flowers you give, please give them today

Don?t waste their beauty on cold lifeless clay

One rose with love could do so much good

And I think all would give it if they just understood


Now God gives life freely, then he takes away

What we do for eachother let us do it today

For we have no promise that tomorrow will come

Don?t sing my praises lord after I?m gone


When life has departed it?s not me any more

Just a form that has suffered, A still heart that was sore

For the soul that has blossomed, it don?t need you anymore

So let it freely to God?s evermore


",My Epitaph,2007
Uncle Earl,"

Kristin Andreassen, Eric Merrill & Abigail Washburn, Uncle Earl


Is that how I lost you?

Love, I lost my one true.


Every place I wanted to go, been there.

Everything I had I had enough to share.

Never worried, only wondered what to wear

Every place I wanted to go, been there.


Chorus


If I ever cried, I knew it wouldn't last.

Candy bars I split, I got the big half.

Knew I had strong legs and I could run fast.

If I ever cried, I knew it wouldn't last.


Chorus


I lived up on the mountain and the view was long.

Knew the band would always play my favorite song.

Crowd of strangers, I knew just how to belong.

Lived up on the mountain and the view was long.


Chorus


Every place I wanted to go, been there.

Everything I had I had enough to share.

Never worried, only wondered what to wear

Every place I wanted to go, been there.

Uncle Festive,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Come now and see the sheen of what
We take in, fake up, throw out, up.

Blood, electric with joy,
The urge to cradle and the urge to destroy:
Take it out on me, out of me, out of sight,
It's all right if you do not want to make it all right.

HERE IT COMES, I CAN TAKE IT.
HERE IT COMES, RIDE THE WAVE.
HEY, BUBBLEHEAD, YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT WHAT YOU CAN TAKE.

Whatever moves forward will also move back.
If you don't expect anything, then that's what you get.
I see you in silhouette against electric light.

The language of bubbles that is spoken there;
Come clean. You wear me out.

Round the flowers you intend to keep.
But the sun is breaking through
The fuzzy mist between me and you.

Uncle Kracker,"85 miles out of Nashville, thinkin' bout
The way things change
Try an keep it by the reigns
I'm a lone drifter, big money flipper
Take anything you got on the rocks in snifter
I missed her in Kentucky, went down to Louisiana
I never had no lovin' like I had in Alabama
A man of my word ain't out to hurt nobody
I'm just a M see to keep the boogie in the party
Been singin' lodi dodi since 84
And I'll be singin' lodi dodi 'til I'm 84
I couldn't ask for more, life's been sweet
So you can save the planet,
I'll save your seat

I been gone for weeks, I ain't slept days
I can't find myself in this self made maze
It's been so long since I've been fine
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way
I never thought about change until
Spend a little time where time stood still
Been lookin' for a mill but I keep comin' up shy
I been a broke fool, I ain't tryin' to be that guy
Want to ride like lightning, roll like thunder
I'm tryin' to get some money, I ain't getting any younger
At times I wonder, at times I won't
Sometimes I give a fuck but most times I don't

even care, through stained glass windows these eyes stare
I try to stay straight but it's kickin' my ass
Every time I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past
I sit half mass like a soldier's flag
That's why my left leg limps and my Dickies sag
It's been so long since I've been fine
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way
Well I been around this crooked land
I come across walks, I shook Jim Beam's hand
I got no plans and no place to go
It keep getting harder to just say no
I see the people laugh and people cry
That's how some live and that's how some die
Well me myself I'm gonna sit right here
And I'm a watch this world break down in tears
All my fears and dark grey skies
Couldn't crack my smile or break my stride
Got too much pride, I got too much shout
I might be down but I still ain't out
Got too much time and that's all I have
When I leave this world I'll still be sad
It's been so long since I've been fine
I'm just tryin', to see the bottom of this bottle of wine
And I know I'll see better days

It's kinda hard to miss the crew
Because we all got limps
We come equipped with new kicks and stetsons 

The super saggy rags and the white trash connection
No flexin', huh, know what I mean
You can feel us fool, we don't need to be seen
It's all about the green, not the drugs we be takin'

That shits free with an LP in circulation
And we be wastin' time
Got them all state, all county, all hood rhymes
It's all good times, thank the lord

For dumb fuckin' people and credit card fraud
We're tearin' up your lawn, we got herds of Lincolns
Step into your crib and have your whole house stinkin'
Don't blink and don't think we're soft

Hide your money and your gold and don't express your thoughts
We get mad props, wreck all shops
Puttin' stops on crews
They get confused and lose, that's what we do

Styles stem from pioneers
Leavin' suckers in awe

Drunk DJ smokin' coiniac dips
Call me the sidekick, thug boy, kid with the limp
I rip through rhymes like a bullet in the breeze

And I float through tracks like a shark in the sea
A wee bit shy, but I comply by me
And I'm a mean mother fucker when I have to be
Got young g's with sleeves and thieves on hold

Strategically placed in case somebody feels bold
I told...you ho's you can't fuck with these cause
I make more papers then trees
See we believe in brotherhood forever is criteria

You fuckin' with Top Dog 
Your fuckin' with family
No I ain't feelin' ya, got all that I can do to hear
Any time you see me you should stand clear

You see me in my Lincoln
I'm in the clubs drinkin'
Who you gonna check bitch, what the fuck you thinkin'
You can check me, but that shit don't slide

You can get your life took tryin' to take my pride
You ride with who, man that shit ain't big
I roll with dogs that'll rock your wig
And got gigs all money

Detroit to Portland
Cellular receivers and beepers is what were sportin'
Your nothin of importance, I don't sweat you
Yeah the drinks on me, but the jokes on you

I'm all about the everyday nothin at all
See I'm not doin very much, I'm just havin a ball
I'm in bed by four, I'm up by noon 
I might sit around, I might write me a tune

I might go fishin' and again I might not
I might get me a forty or pour me some scotch
The watch on my wrist, that don't even exist
A lot of pissed people from appointments that I've missed 

I dissed everybody and their mom for spite
'Cause everybody's barkin', but nobody ever bites
Your talkin' loud, sayin nothin'
Get you dad, get your cousin

Go and get your boy cause he's as big as a house
Now take your pussy ass click and get the fuck out
I'm the estranged, deranged, I got domains like states
I live in plush hotels with them hourly rates

I do big plates eight times a day
The crew be livin' large at the seafood bay
Got a way with the world and now I'm lookin' to scramble
Ain't about to ass out on a no good gamble

Could handle anything, but I ain't down for broke
So before somebody slides, somebody's getting choked
I'm a no good freak, tweak skin like rashes
I lose a little love with everyday that passes

Ain't a masotistic, rock statistics, vocabulary
I'm a very shy simplistic
And get this, some people say I changed
I'm the same mother fucker with the same old name

A little extra game and extra cash could see
You could fuck me, but don't put it past me
You want to bash me and got no reason
I can lay up in the Caymans for four straight seasons

I ain't a punk, I refuse to be
I live for what is, not what used to be

I couldn't steer so I got me a chauffer
Hired a chef cause I was tired of stouffers
I got over and people showed envy
Cause I couldn't choose between a Lincoln and a Benzy

At the party big booty pinchin'
Chillin, like a villain, balloon fillin Whack MC killin, the fine ho drillin

With the million dollar talent
And the ten cent brain,
Been gone too long, too much cocaine,
But now that I'm back, on the block

I'm ready to rock
Left to right, all night
My game's tight, I wish you might
Take a bite

Fresh from the harvest
Who'll be the largest, hardest smartest label in town
Top Dog get down

The world goin' Kid Rock crazy
Wicked witches be flyin' on broomsticks,
Kid Rock be comin' with the boom boom boom biatch

So get a good look bro
Get a good gander

Persevered for ten long years
10 years, I was there for 8
And I ain't seen a meaner mother puttin' food on our plate
I've learned to hate, and that's a damn shame
Because I'm gettin' pretty good at this bitch ass game

Pissin' on my dog cause they're down on their luck
Now you're stuck like a pig in the poke

Legal roles and dumb (hoes) and death threats
Nat work for network and that works
And people jerk for perks that ain't theirs
And that hurts, you work your whole life

Cause a bunch of punks wanna poach your stuff
That's not your stuff
So don't touch that
And don't make me break with this baseball bat, cause

You're not playing nice
My dog likes to share
You're going to get smacked for not playing fair
It's in the air you can feel the tension
We don't take kind to senseless dissension
You bark like a dog. You fight like a dog
You live by your dog. You die by your dog
Now there's a calm before the storm
And I'd hate to be you when it starts to get warm
Clouds are forming. Crowds are swarming
You've had for-warning. Now pray for mourning, cause

I wish sometimes that I could say she never told me so
And I'd walk a million miles on down the same old broken road
Now you can always reap just what you sew I know that's true
And I pray some day that I wake and my poor feet won't fit these shoes

I want to go down to see her
She's my little queen
I want to go down to tell her
She means the world to me
I wish I was down to watch her
Play that tambourine
She always brought a smile to me
I'd do anything
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me 
Everything's gonna be alright
If I listened closely I can hear it oh so clear

Like a south bound train like fallin' rain like a whisper in my ear
Everything I'd like to hear you know I don't hear much no more
But I know someday that you'll come my way and you'll walk right through that door

I want to go down to see her
She's my little queen
I want to go down to tell her
She means the world to me

Sometimes I feel like something is gone here
Something is wrong here
I don't belong here
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town
And I've lost what I've found
It'll all turn around
In a little while I'll be thinking about you
In a little while I'll still be here without you
You never gave me a reason to doubt you
In a little while I'll be thinking about you baby
I'll be thinking about you baby

On the other side of a coin there's a face
There's a memory somewhere that I can't erase
And there's a place that I'll find someday
But sometimes I feel like it's slipping away

Some things are lost, some left behind
Some things are better left for someone else to find
Maybe in time I could finally see
I just wonder, wonder if you think about me

Not a single day passes that I don't think of you
I'm running on empty and a mountain so high
I can pull out your pictures and look in your eyes
I long for the day when your old man comes home
It kills me to hear you say daddy don't go

You say daddy come home
You'll just have to wait
I hope when I get there that it won't be too late

I can count on memories 'cuz they don't go away

She moves me like a Memphis soul song

I'm not always there I know but she don't mind at all
As pretty as a picture that hangs on my own wall
She's like Mississippi when the sun comes up at dawn
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

With an angel on my left side and the devil on my right
She's the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights
Of all the ones who've left me it's a wonder she's not gone
She moves me like a Memphis soul song
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

She don't care what the game is, she's always down to play
My world without her seems a million miles away
She don't have to worry, I know where I belong
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

I've been dealt some aces and I've played them all the same
But she's the only one that keeps me in the game
No fame or fortune could ever keep me gone
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

With an angel on my left side and the devil on my right
She's the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights
Of all the ones who've left me it's a wonder she's not gone
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

There's a magic down in Memphis that never seems to fade
Even now them voices carry like a lonely serenade
It's the memories that still and always will be on my mind
They move me every time

She sees the good in everything there is to see
Sometimes I wonder what she ever see's in me
I'm not always right you know but she's never led me wrong
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

In all my travels I've never found a way
To find the words that say the things I'd like to say
I've sang some melodies but she's my favorite one
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

With an angel on my left side and the devil on my right
She's the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights
Of all the ones who've left me it's a wonder she's not gone
She moves me like a Memphis soul song
She moves me like a Memphis soul song

And I can never get enough
No never get enough of a good thing

Another ""baby you, baby oh"" oh I don't think I'll ever know

I-I-I-I-I love you

I-I-I-I-I do

Time and time again we need a little break
From the give and take
We make the same mistakes
I know I've never been the one to let my feelings show
And I guess in that regard I'm really not alone
We could all use a push and when it comes to shove
We sing of life and love and a lack thereof
But with a little bit of luck we could never get enough of a good thing

Uncle Kracker,"Hey mom and dad, I don't know where to start.
I hate to break the news, but I got a broken heart.
That sweet southern belle, that I met in Tennessee
Got a hickey on her neck and it ain't from me.
Seems there's someone special she's been meeting at the gym,
but the crazy thing about it, is that someone's not a him.

[Chorus]
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.
It was cool for a minute, now its bringing me down.
People talkin' bout it all over this town.
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.

All my friends say, she's just going through a phase
and I believed her when she said I just need a little space
But then I found pictures on her cellular phone,
of them doing things, when I wasn't home
It hit me like a brick, I guess I should have seen the signs
This was more than just a friend and a bottle of wine.

[Chorus]

Yeah mom and dad, really nothing left to say
I'll be sure to keep you posted if she swing it back this way
I guess I'm not as sad as you think I might be
The part that makes me mad is that they didn't invite me.

I keep stylin', smilin'

I got no worries that I'm worried about
It's like I caught some crazy, happy disease

Ain't lookin' for direction,
Don't need it if it don't come free,
A billboard says ""Trust the Lord""
A piece of country I ain't never seen.

Just put the pedal to the floor and drive
Don't it feel so good to you?
I feel so alive

I tell myself that I've moved on but only half the way

And every time I close my eyes
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight
Your faded jeans across the hood
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good
And I'm wiser than I was that day
Now I'd have some words to say
Ones that just might make you stay with me
That's only when I close my eyes

Lately I've been talkin' to God again
And a string of things I didn't do back then
No doubt I'm better off havin' had you
Yeah you taught me how to love
Taught me how to lose it too

And every time I close my eyes
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight
Your faded jeans across the hood
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good
And I'm wiser than I was that day
Now I've have some words to say
Ones that just might make you stay with me
That's only when I close my eyes

And every time I close my eyes
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight
Your faded jeans across the hood

Uncle Kracker,"Bourbon and whiskey, tequila and scotch
Chocolate martinis and Jägerbomb shots
Ice cold cerveza replaces a day
Takes off the edge and takes us away

Play us a song about losing
Play us a song about love
Play us a song about freedom
Feeling wild and young

And play that piano
Let every song reach into our hearts
Play that piano
And let us forget who we are

They wanna shake it to mustang sally
They're screaming Margarita-Ville
Writing New Orleans ladies, somebody's baby
On 100 dollar bills

All the boys wanna hear Bocephus
Centerfold and purple rain
It's all drunken drama, somebody's mama
Got runned over by a damned old train

Sing us a song about dreaming
Sing us a song about life
Sing us a song about leaving
Cheatin' husbands and wives

We hide from tomorrow and yesterday's hells
We run from each other, we run from ourselves
Get lost in the music, get lost in the dark
What we all have in common is our favorite bar

I hope it's me

Uncle Kracker,"Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of the lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there, sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me sit down on my knee and whisper
""Oh, I love you""
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead, that's the bed, where we'd lie in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table, don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say ""good morning dear""
There's her ring, all her things, and her clothes are in the closet
Where she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you see the nursery, oh she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

Uncle Lucius,"Took my first breath, where the muddy Brazos, spills into the gulf of Mexico
Where the skyline’s colored by chemical plants, t’put bread on the table of the working man
Where the working man does his best to provide, safety and shelter for kids and a wife
Given little love n soul every day, making over time to keep the wolves away

Well I was barely thirteen when the company man, tried to dig my daddy’s grave
It happened on a French owned tanker ship, spilling poison in the Galveston Bay
Where the liquid fire filled his lungs and his eyes, silenced any mortal cries
Cold and the grip of death stinging pain, he fought like hell to keep the wolves away

For the next few years dad was sick as a dog, but he made a recovery just to spite the odds
Settlement came and we moved out of town, where the sky isn’t heavy with refinery clouds
Yeah he’s still alive he’s doing good he’s in his fifties
But the moneys running out, and he’s pinching for pennies
So goin’ for broke with every song I’ve made, ‘cos now it’s my turn to keep the wolves away",Keep the Wolves Away,2012

Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million
With the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million
All over the planet earth
Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war
That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality
Take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
That's the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through

There is only one God
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah

At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind
You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending, is about to come

If you take one step, I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know you got to be strong, gotta hold on

Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
Nor their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons
Peace we out

I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu
To survive must now be taught, to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread",Wu-Revolution,1997

The strong will survive, the weak shall perish
Why'all need more courage, I keep why'all nourished

Get in line, I let you know right now
You need to slow right down or you get blown right now
From what I see it's systematic how we push to addicts
Demographics make the street life hell or drastic

In the hood we see oppressive genocide
'Cause if it's on it's on, you know at least 10 men'll ride
But on the other side, corruption runs deep
I'm aware of the conspiricies, discussion is brief

They're building more prisons, spendin less on schools
On the block Smith & Wess-ons and Teflons rule
It's hard to escape it, certain laws are sacred

A long time, I'm doin fine, I feel teriffic
I bop up the street, see-walk to the beat
It's cold outdoors, so I got to keep some heat

I never know when a cutthroat gon' try to test me
Disrespect me, things could get messy
Yes he, shoot a good game, like James
I mean Jesse, watch out nigga, heavens to Betsies

Baby you are my dream come true

When a love has come and gone
But I'll help you dry your tears
And I'll nurse your broken heart

Is it can never be denied

I'll massage and crack your back

I hope that this letter finds you in time
'Cause your love is ending and my life's just beginning
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you
And it made me want to say

I don't ever want to see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby

I don't ever want to see you again
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend
That you were messing around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

It took me a minute to wake up and see
What the love of my life was doing to me
I wanted to lay down and die
'Cause my pride wouldn't let me cry
Somehow I knew I had to get over it

He said he couldn't understand
Until he felt your touch
Now he can see why I love you so much
And that's so unfair
I never thought I'd have to share
Your love that I thought was given
To only me and that's why

I don't ever want to see you again
But I stuck by you till the end

That you were messing around with
I didn't want to notice it

And you say you love me?
Love must've been blind
'Cause I sure didn't see this one coming
My best friend, huh?
They say keep the one's you love close
And your enemy's even closer
But I can't win for losing, girl
'Cause the one I thought was a friend to me
Ended up being my true enemy

Listen to me, baby
I gave you everything
My love, and my ring
And you, oh what you laid at me
And I don't want to see you again

I don't ever want to see you again
But I stuck by you till the end

And they played in the sunshine but when it rained, they couldn't stay
They didn't give me the difference that I had to have around me

You gave a lot to someone who was long gone
Helped me get over, gave me strength to carry on
Helped me move on, I need

I received a letter but there was no addressee
So I paid it no mind, in fact, I wanted to send it back
But something that I was feeling said open it

It said, ""Dear reader, once close friend of mine
I hope that this letter finds you in time
'Cause your love is ending and my life's just beginning
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you
And it made me want to say

I don't ever want to see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby

I don't ever want to see you again
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend
That you were messing around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

It took me a minute to wake up and see
What the love of my life was doing to me
I wanted to lay down and die
'Cause my pride wouldn't let me cry
Somehow I knew I had to get over it

He said he couldn't understand
Until he felt your touch
Now he can see why I love you so much
And that's so unfair
I never thought I'd have to share
Your love that I thought was given
To only me and that's why

I don't ever want to see you again
But I stuck by you till the end

That you were messing around with

And you say you love me?
Love must've been blind
'Cause I sure didn't see this one coming
My best friend, huh?
They say keep the one's you love close
And your enemy's even closer
But I can't win for losing, girl
'Cause the one I thought was a friend to me
Ended up being my true enemy

I gave you everything
My love, and my ring
And you, oh what you laid at me

Uncle Si Robertson,"Now the night before Christmas, I was sitting in my house
And there wasn't nothing  moving around, not even a mouse.
The socks were hung by the fireplace to dry,
In hopes that old Santa Clause would bring me some pie

My children are grown, so nobody's in bed
And I got the sound of duck calls stuck in my head.
Mama's in her gown, and I got on my cap,
And I ain't tired, cause I took a three hour nap.

When all of a sudden, I heard a big crash
I figured it was some coon, diggin' in the trash
I went to the window, and slipped on my shoes
Cause I don't like critters, snooping around in my refuge

Now the moon was bright, and there was no sight of snow
And hey, I have the eyes of an eagle, just so you know.
When all of a sudden, what seemed to appear,
Was a tiny little tree stand, and whole lot of deer. Hmm

I knew I had seen him, he was acting very silly
And I was convinced, it could only be Willy
Now he was yelling and screaming, calling out names
And those deer started moving, and all those suckers came!

Now I thought he said ""Hey, Dasher, hey Prancer, and Spitzer
Maybe Comet, something about Cupid, Donner and Wolf Blitzer
Let's head to the roof, from there they would spring
These deers had magical powers, and all of them had wings

Now I took off my glasses, cause this was too weird
Big bucks turned into ducks, is what seemed to appear
Hey they circled around, and I swear that they flew
These deer had bags of my garbage, and big Willy in there too

And then, in a a flash, they was tearing up my roof
I heard the stompin' and chompin' of each little hoof
As I drew out my pistol, not knowing what to say
Down the fireplace came Willy, he must have got away

He had on a mink coat, from his bandana to his foot
And his clothes were all nasty, covered it ashes and soot.
He had my bag of garbage flung over his back,
And he looked like a fat raccoon, lookin' for a snack

As I stood there, wondering why he was not in bed
I yelled, ""Hey, I don't have any cookies you crazy knuckle head""
His mouth was wide open as he stood there in shock
Then I realized, I was in my tighty whites, with only a top

Alright, quit laughing boy

OK, Willy looked like he was smoking a pipe
I know I never seen that, and it didn't seem right
Not sure it was Willy's face, but no doubt it was his belly
With the unmistakable shake, cause hey, Willy loves his jelly

Willy's chubby and plump, like a fat little mouse
And I got tickled at seeing him and said ""Why are you at my house?""
He winked at me and smiled, as he set down his stash
I saw it was not my garbage, and it certainly was not my trash

Hey, this cat didn't say a word, as he pulled out some toys
And not just cheap crap. This stuff was for big boys!
He was doing a job, and he was going to work
This could not be Willy, because Willy, he's a jerk!

He left me some goodies, then he sprang in the air
I wasn't sure what I just saw, but hey, I didn't care
And I heard him yell out, as he left with his pack
""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night, Jack!""",The Night Before Christmas,2013

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.

Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say:

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,

I can't forget the sound, 'cause it's here to stay
The sound of people chasing money and money getting away

A long way from happiness
In a three-hour-away town
Whiskey bottle over Jesus
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now

In between the dirt and disgust there must be
Some air to breathe and something to believe
Liquor and guns the sign says quite plain
Somehow life goes on in a place so insane

A long way from happiness
In a three-hour-away town
Whiskey bottle over Jesus
Not forever, just for now
Not forever, just for now",Whiskey Bottle [Live Acoustic][#][*],1990
Uncle Tupelo,"Shaking hands and fingers that do tremble
Soldier's Joy has been a bitter pill
Though in battle, a brave man I resemble
Alone I am a coward without will 

Pierce McGee from the great State of Missouri
To the Show-Me-State militia I belong
And to judge from the pride on the Confederate side 
I'd say five hundred thousand rebels can't be wrong

A rebel stand is no place for a traitor
A loveless Union cannot bend us to her will
Cannot command the soldiers who now hate her 
Nor demand the fealty of her generals 

I took a rifle ball in my shoulder
But my entire body filled with pain
I pleaded with them all at the field hospital 
""Oh, God, another shot of morphine!"" 

Soldier's Joy, oh what's the point in pleasure
When it's only meant to kill the pain
Lay down my armsand take the coffin's measure 
Or take up arms and send me out to fight again 

Shaking hands, was I a coward, was I brave?
With shaking hands, I took the bitter pill
Now tell the story on my grave, my soul they could not save
What the bullet would not kill, the needle will",Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy),1991

Your heaven looks just like my hell beautiful as far as I can tell

This isn't written for anyone alive just the songs that he sang

Will it be worth mine

And if Managua's bullets don't fly young men still would die for glory
Or for their countries

Try to accept that it's all worth whilewhen you've been disengaged
Severed from any world that's mine

You can hang the blame on the wall
It'll be a frame around us all deluged by stickers and billboards
The conversation turns to war
Never thought it would come down to this it seems every person for themself

Uncle Tupelo,"Hunted down
Someone said, no story, no gain
Wipe the clock right now
I despise what you crave

I remember you
When you wore a different face
Never heard a story of anyone
Who drove the blacktop insane

Leaning on a stoplight
Waiting for eventual change
What's it matter right now
It's not so easy to gauge

Every time
That you ask for more
It's the sound that makes the colors go blind

And everything comes in threes
But your face shows two
Lost in the watershed
Way out of tune

Ain't it hard
When the spirit doesn't catch you
Gravity's the winner
And it weighs you down
It weighs you down",Wipe the Clock,1992
Uncle Tupelo,"Early in the morning, sometimes late at night
Sometimes I get the feeling that everything's alright
Early in the evening, sometimes in the day
Sometimes I get the feeling everything's okay
Because everything cuts against the tide
When you're by my side
Name me a song that everybody knows
And I'll bet you it belongs to Acuff-Rose
Children in the playground, the folks in the home
Anybody anywhere who's ever been alone
Because everything cuts against the tide
When I hear that sound",Acuff-Rose,1993

The lessons we've traveled
As soon as we're out we're kicking our way back in

A miracle might point the way

Silver spikes and mace

Nothing left to lose
Been there, no luck at all

We tear out the threads and move along
We can't seem to find common ground

Carried it this far
Got the west side winds to keep it steady

Could carry that heavy load
If I really thought it would matter
Farcical hair appears
As a blind side, clean the slate

Working in the halls of shame
Lay it down in full view
Lay it down
What the hell were we thinking

Before the fire burned out?
I can't find you now
And I didn't know you then
Loneliness drinks the bitters

Till the cold winds warm again
It's a feel for the game
Mouth open wide, screams and hollers
Working in the halls of shame

Lay it down in full view
Lay it down
I gambled once and won, never made a dollar
And beauty fades to grey

And I pray the very best will guard her
And provide the way

Electricity tells a story

Or try to wash it away

Or pay up to the echoes of 'okay'
No more, no more will I see you
No more will I see you
No more will I see you

You've schemed more than you have
You've borrowed more than you know
Better to steal the crumbs
It makes it easier to go

Paralyzed by conscience
Looking for an opening

Never thought once to ask how's the temperature

Too busy with the finer points
Of each struggle we're after

No more will I see you

No more will I see you

There's an eardrum bleeding, yeah it's in my head
How could I still be so in love when I know
We've been had?

Republicans and Democrats can't give you the facts

Let me know what it's like

Don’t make it sound so simple

So don’t even try 'cuz this is your day

For I got chores to keep me busy, clock to keep my time
A pretty girl to love me, with the same last name as mine
When the flowers wilt, a big old quilt to keep us warm
And I got the sun to see your blue eyes, and tonight you're in my arms

Sometimes I get unwound when fancy cars drive past
Money don't get me down, I can't make it last
And I bite my nails and if that fails I go get myself stoned

Son, you finally got it made
Old Hank made it here, we’re all sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
No, I don't think Hank done it this way

Ten years down the road, one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Singing my song, none of them wanna hear us
And I don't think Hank could've done 'em this way
I don't think Hank done 'em this way

I've seen the world with a five piece band
Staring at the back side of me
Tell me one more time just so I'll understand
Are you sure Hank done 'em this way?
Are you sure Hank done 'em this way?

Not that stuff
Think it over again

In the back of your mind, it won't go away
Saying, ""take a look around and tell me everything's just fine
From what I can see now, we'd be fools or lying""

Now there's too many people trying too hard

""Got front and back, and side to side""
""Got front and back, and side to side""
""Got front and back, and side to side""
(Never let broke gold diggers ride)

I got a '64 Chevy in my yard
A white drop top, pearl paint job is hard
White plush inside ? is fresh
Triple gold double, A Dayton's is the best, ugh
I got them sixteen switches like Dre
Cos where I'm from fool that's what everybody play
UGK-1 written smooth on my plates
Cos real pimp players don't never roll fake
I'm bout to hit Dove Way, get past Troy's
I'm dipping by myself, I'm bout to call up my boys
I pass by the Colt I see some women looking fine
I hit the corner one more time to see the booty from behind
Got to the corner, hit the switch and made it jump
I got the JVC's and the trigger so it bump, ugh
I know you player-hatin busters wanna ride man
I got the, front back, and side to side daddy

[Chorus: x2]

[Pimp C]
It's pimping pimping, I'm hitting switches, checking out my strap
Making sure these snitches, ain't stopping riches, 5-Oh on my back
But I keep on dipping, steady pimping, kicking, how's about the winter man?
I'm chilling, hiding and winning, pockets feeling fat

[Bun B]
And I come round your corner shining, leaning, ever so sunning
Gangstas put down their gun and
Women and children come outside and start running
They catch a glimpse of the P-A pimp whooping whips
Never going out out like simps, walking your block with gangsta limp

[Pimp C]
Some fool roll Lincoln, some fools roll Jag
But the crew from Texas roll them Lacs, white gloss and rags
With the candy paint and wheel and grill, and wooden dash
'94 I gotta keep it trill, down for my cash

[Bun B]
I got's my stash so I switches, keep on burning
And these tires keep on turning
I be rolling through your scene, flashing green, freaks be yearning
To be down, the Under Ground Kingz drinking Crown with the Coke
Never broke, we make the concrete bound baby

[Chorus: x2]

[Bun B]
It's the tough boy, boulevard niggas, rolling around tan up
All four corners on your block fool, nothing but that bunny hop
Happening, high gassing, daily routine, my load is plush
Interior crush and fool I'm through clean
Don't be like the rest, I must excite the best
In your soul so letta player take control
And do what the hell ya been waiting
To see and that's me rolling on three Dayton's
Wit one of them things in the air, it's hanging up there
Shining steel fat man, but I don't care if everybody sit back and stare
Everywhere we go they lining up as if we're starting up a parade
And everybody thinking they get paid
But I don't really give a damn, what a six pack?
Twelves in the trunk, chrome dip, don't even trip, I ain't nobody's punk
Go swing down sweet rag top and let me ride
On a skank, baby don't wait let's glide and slide right

And this not a threat, bet that, I ain't gonna let that shit slide
Gotta get that bitch right, want him dead by midnight
I followed him from his crib to the crack spot
I watched him go in and come back out, I got ready to pull the Mac out
Sandwiched him by the feeder of 610
Unloaded the pistol, now dirt is now what his dick in
Shit, I seen a slab get stripped
The discs, seats, and sound gone, and candy paint burnt to a crisp
These niggas gettin' hated on for the '84s that they skated on
Jackers in the dark alley waited on
The fool comin' out the gamblin' shack
Pistol to his back, took 4 ounces of crack, and a fat doja sack

He occupying his time trying to get boys for they blades
Getting 'em for they Chevy 'Burbans, they jumping out of who doos
Coming down swinging, jumping out of candy blues talking 'bout give it up smooth
Baby boy, it's some hating going on in P.A
Mostly over stinky bitches and who sold the most yay
Niggas stunting, pulling pistols ending up in the grave
When I pull I always pop, that's why I'm living today
Girl-ass niggas 'causing plex between friends
And when you bust on your boy don't neither one of y'all niggas win
You end up killing somebody that you really ain't wanna kill

Player haters, scan'lous hoes, and 'Lac-driving slab hurters
Acting bad after 8, you can catch us on the late
Rolling dice, blowing, and sipping on the bar straight
We got the red drank, orange drank, purple drank
Laughing at these mark hoes that say they never heard of drank
Half-gallon Big Gulp, Big Red, big cup
Drink mixed up, blowing sweets, and lighting sticks up
Now in my new world, slow down, I can see
Niggas talking shit, trying to see if what they said got to me
But ho-ass type of skills say a lot to me
You just gon' fuck around and get yourself shot, to be
Or not to be, motherfuckers plot to see me crack
Under pressure, so they just impress a nigga to see me react
These niggas try to start me down like a scary clown
Don't dare me, 'round here we fuck your game up like Larry Brown
And carry pounds of killer 'round like groceries
With a presence that make you not want to stand close to me

Underground Kingz,"Listen up I got a story to tell
Ay fool, listen up I got a story to tell
Say dog, listen up I got a story to tell
Say man, listen up I got this story to tell

Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
Now this was not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, tryna push me
He used to hold dick now he wanna be in my shoes
Hatin' like a baby mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryin' to hold on to my little chunk but not a punk in the parking lot bumping his gums
With his Ki's in the trunk, oh what I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump
You aimin' that bitch in the sky you chump
Point that motherfucker this way and dump
Oh what you scared to go to the pen?
Thinkin' them niggas gon' tap your rump?
Man I thought he played bold but he ain't even fuss
Man the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to buss
But his trigger stayed cold I wasn't surprised
I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise a sheep in wolf's clothing
On the prey, who tried to hunt the hunter
And got hunted down his goddamn self in PA
Niggas it's where we stay
Ain't none of that K-K-K'n or playin' so see A
Or E about your life 'fore you test yourself
And make a nigga break you off some peace to rest yourself
Oh yes your health is what's in question
And I hope that this ass whippin'
Teach you a motherfuckin' lesson

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South boy's comin' up cold
Talkin' down on my name and what it's all about
You niggas better be gettin' some cut and get my name out yo mouth
'Cause I dunno why you got flex with me
Testin' me but I'mma pull my shit and let you see
That all that carry the jack ain't able to survive
So you haters need to quit with that po' hustlin'
And take another ride

Niggas jumped and crossed the line
The movies got these boys fucked up in the mind
Not to mention the wine and codeine syrup combined
Easy access to 9s
And shit talkin' hoes that's fine
And all they got time for is pourin' Swishers down
Committing crimes amped off water
And some exaggerated rhyme
So if bein' hard ain't in your heart
Then don't start niggas'll tear your weak mind apart

Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school
He don't know I hang with killers we'll erase that fool
Wouldn't give a fuck about him but he kin to my son
If you think that I'm that nigga then you picked the wrong one
'Cause I live by the gun, die by the gun
Hot bullets burn some say that them bitches stun
So raise your own children don't try to raise mine
And when you see me step with caution 'cause I'm buckin' for mine, bitch

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You done crossed the line now you gon' get fucked
I already told you before but you ain't barring that
So this time I'm handlin' mine and gon' erase you off the map
Such a shame but it's all in the game
And since the early 60's ain't a damn thing changed
We got haters over here and haters over there
But I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air

I see you trippin' off that water and you feel like you bad
'Cause yo bitch done chose a pimp and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt 'cause I fucked your girl
Put big dick in her world, bust nuts in her curls
When I hit it from the back she said ""baby I can't take it""
Push my dick up in her harder bitch I'm straight up tryin' to break it
You a simp-ass nigga you told that bitch that you love her
But I'm straight up fuckin' that pussy like that nigga off they colors
But I ain't gonna get shot 'cause you ain't shootin' shit
The best thing you can do is go and try and beat that bitch
'Cause this man's style showstopper pistol popper you ain't ready
If I let this hot thing hit you fool, your stomach like spaghetti
Fool you talkin' loud but you move too slow
Tellin' niggas all your plans got you tied up in a van
Nigga what the fuck is up (up) in the place to be
First I want the money nigga then I want the fuckin' Ki's
Kidnap robbery 'cause you said you wanted me dead
Since you want a nigga dead
Buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40 nigga I be comin' fed
Got the sawed off pump with night vision infrared
So play me like a pussy and you will get fucked
Nigga I'm hangin' out the truck b-buck buck
Hit your nigga in the leg hit your bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay
So your ass will get touched

Speak the wrong words I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched cause yo ass deserve
To get done real bad in front of yo kids
To show 'em what real type of bitch you is
And it's that boy named 3 to the 2 forever stayin' true
Just a player makin' do and I gotta tell it to the
Whole wide world how you got bitched razor necked just like

Fuckin up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home

Tryin to sell that fuckin dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'mma go to Port Arthur and run them fuckin niggaz

Brought his fuckin gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac

Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope

Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest

Breathless gasping for air, for in thy dreams you where
Awakening to the bleakness in my room
As my eyes begin to blear reality sets and starts the fear
For do dreams come true or do I die alone
Waiting like the petals of a wilting flower fall off
Until there is non and the once beautiful flowers dies naked
With no one to clothe it
Will I hold you in the grave or will the grave hold me?
The numbing dreams never end the swallow's wings still amongst
The idle wind
My colored world turns to grayscale
Recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel
Contradiction of thy thoughts standing calm love not lost
Searching till I find my princess whose passionate eyes cut right through me
For what is life if love only exists in thy thoughts?
What is romance if it is all fiction?
Nothing but a portrait left empty, a passing cloud of hurt
By to meet my love in the flesh is to find my whole heart
Your heart breaks though me your love is the key
Longing for my hearts door
To what day till I see sunrays shine upon your face
I dream of you the way you look
The beating of love in your heart
Your wolds are like the flowing of a spring, knowing thy love
Waits for me until eternity's end
Is this poetry or is this love's sickness
Engulfing my every being
Take the heart from you and the blood ceases from me

Breathe taking the closest thing to me and my savior
Falling in love to a person I have never met but knowing she has salvation's fragrance
By God's grace this love will be free and able to fly away above
The earth to a point of exhaustion
But your breath will keep me alive
Words are pointless for this love is speechless
Preparing fro the curtains close
Laying their clutching hands so tight I can feel your heart
Telling me it will be all right
Ascension to heaven wehre this love can not only walk
But it runs through the endless fields of joy
Where love neither ends nor begins but flows everlasting
This was thy dream this daybreak and will by thy prayer
That I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day
And butterflies sing with us as we write love symphony

With zero apologies
My God, where have I been'

While I sink to the bottom
I'll sing out as it fills with water
I hope I've done enough

When this thing breaks
I will be you, you will be me

And riddled with dizzy

When this thing breaks
I will be you, you will be me

I will never break through

If Your work leaves our hands

Let us because we all have ears
Let us because we all have eyes

Is one of the best collaborations of all time
Kansas City's
Humboldt County's
Show 'em we are what we are (hey yo!)

When I rap no never know what the fewer, better
A mouth full of cheddar make a greedy setter
Got a mean vendetta, my team is too clever
Never ever gonna stop, 'cause I rock forever (forever)
You ain't never gonna see me when I be me
When it comes to the rhymes, can't beat me
All the girls say, you complete me
Even some 'em weekly wanna meet me (haha)
Bust on the scene like Jeezy (yeeeah)
And everybody want a Potluck CD
After the show, collect the dough
Then we go to the hotel blowin' smoke
You gonna hold the Po' because my flow is dope
Because I'm invincible, you can't sink the boat
Fuck American Idol, we rock hardcore bitch
Get stupid, get dumb, matter fact let's thizz
Underrated in about my peers
Put the pump in the back of the Benz
Quick better tell all your friends
It's Potluck and Tech N9ne rockin' again
And we rockin M-O with Krizz Kaliko
His flow is so cold, gotta go gold
And a lock in the do' like a fo-fo at a show
Man I'm never so-so
Under syllable criminal won't forget it but let it go
In the stereo, sure up and gettin' high
Motherfuckers starin' but pity for 'em baring
But when they lyric go and if you wanna bet 'em they gonna die
Now we gotta roll the riches (no lie)
Hanging up the colder bitches (don't cry)
Gotta stand in the street with my hand on my dick
Cause I wanna be sayin', I'm rich bitch (bitch!)

When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See I'm fuckin' with ya'll, 'cause we are what we are

Anybody got another pill
I gotta get a motherfucker to give me the artificial loving
I wanna be trippin', I gotta be high
Tryin' to kick it hella wicked until we die,
Never the nigga to get a milli when I'm trippin' and buckin' it
I'm the nigga in the party with your bitch and I'm fuckin' it
But you gotta be ready to get up and go
If you wanna start up a fight over raggedy ho's
Me and Potluck, put the cocks up, in a hot slut
Tryin' to bust a nut before the slot locks up
Given a minute to get us up in it but everybody shiver when I deliver the jock pops up
Underrated he made it a bomb with the heat
Makin' it so it ain't never calm in the street
Tech the nigga with One Ton, nigga we come from nothin'
We bustin' like hell spawns on a bu-bu-bu-bu-beat
Verbally you heard of me, murder thee, mental capacity
Flippin' with Missouri in back of me, pack a be
Thinkin' I'm 'bout to be Tech attack a motherfucker with the tongue
Nigga you better be steadily bringin' the melody,
Readily, 'cause every nigga's thinkin' ahead of me
We'll never be fetty because I bring it like a bullet from a gun
So what you really wanna do?
Get back on the road, get a sack, crack a brew
Put a bitch in the back and I give her what she really
Want a motherfucker to makin' it do, what it do
With the Carrabou Lou, 151, Malabu Rum, and Pineapple Juice
You know the party gotta be fun, compatible groups of nigga's
Chillin' with your home girls in 707 with the liquor

Bartender can I get another round
With a little bit a ice and a lot more Crown
Keep it strong with the clowns when I'm in your town
Bet it all goes down, 'cause I got that sound
Say what I want to when I jump up on your rhythm
When I smoke better try Humboldt
Better hit 'til you cry and choke
Now know why I rhyme so dope
Party all day and night with a hoe
Gotta get that dough like I just passed go
Where the next show better be the best, yo
Kick it at the hotel, I just get so frisco
All the way to 'Isco, flow magic and I say presto
Let a nigga get a little sip of X-O
I pull the best one and tell the bitch let's go (come on)
I do what I do, rap what I be
Flow straight heat, gettin' high in the street
Got what I need, grow a mouth full of seed
You can take it from me, we the top of the peak
Do what I can for the fan, I am what I am, I'm another weed man
Green like a vegan, not a mean man
I don't gotta green thumb, I gotta whole green hand

Undertow,"I can't deny what I had spoken,taking back all that I said.
I wish I could erase those words I had chosen just to get you back again.
Now I wallow in sorrow to the fact that you are gone.
I place the blame on myself,admitting that I was wrong.

I realize the damage I caused to secede from the pain.
The words that slipped from my lips were used for my gain. 
The last thing I wanted was to hurt you like that but my selfishness had its way and sympathy was what I lacked. 
I wish I could take it back.(x4)",Apology,1994
Undertow,"Held back...
Held back by a thread,by a memory of what used to be.
I just want to live my life but this thread is choking me.
I tried and tried to please you but it never changed a thing. 

Now you're tearing me in two with all the broken memories you bring 
And how its killing me as the days just eat away.
I just want to forget you but my mind won't let me escape. 
The past has its grip and is beating down on me. 

I fight back with all my strength to find I'll never be free. 
Was it all a game to you,did you ever care?

Did you ever care?

Held back...
Held back by a thread,by a memory of what used to be.
I just want to live my life but this thread is choking me.

Was it all a game to you,did you ever care?x2",Escape,1994
Undertow,"Where do we go from here?

The voice of failure is what I fear
Should I cry in anger or reflect on despair?
Seduced by the past with emptiness that lasts
The shallowness that shows and the selfishness that grows

Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?

I refuse to sit complacent and watch it all slip away
I'm not content with the effort that I've made
Pondering on solution, I know the answers lie there
But striving for improvement is clearly unaware
A true commitment with no possible gain is just 
Taken for granted and thrown back in our face
I have reason to believe that we can rebuild from the past
Redeem and prosper if just given the chance

Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?",Where Do We Go,1994
Undertow,"Follow your rules so I can be myself.
Listen to what you say so I can think for myself.
Everything I say has been said before.
Everything I think has been thought before.
Who is in control?

All my beliefs have been traced out for me.
My fate has been laid out for me.
I look in the mirror and all I see is you.
I look at myself and all I see is you.
Who is in control?

I'll fight you,Ill resist you.
You can't control me.",Control,1995

Why do I starve myself from what I need and feed on what makes me bleed?
Everything so right,so I must make it wrong.
Everyones insight but I push you away.
Kill this pain.
(Kill this pain!)
Why do I walk away from all that I work for?
Why do I open up just to close the door?
You throw me a line and I choke myself.
You've given me everything but I still cry for help.
Kill this pain.",Kill,1996
Undertow,"Tell me how you feel. Your opinion means everything to me. I can't make up my mind.
Open my eyes to what you see. Tell me what you're thinking. I need to know.
Without knowing what you think, I feel so alone.

Why do I let you make the call? Why do I let you decide it all?
My world is decided by what you think,without your voice I sink.
Hanging on to your every word. Deciding what's right or wrong.

The strength that your words bring, make me feel like I belong.
Holding you so high.
Your thoughts became my religion.
Everything you say clouds my own decisions.",Everything,2004
Undertow,"When I leave,it will be like I was never here. 
When I leave,you won't think of me much longer. 
I'll just turn and leave forever. I won't forgive. I won't forget. 
When I leave,you'll replace me and my image. 
When I leave,I won't say goodbye. 

I'll just turn and leave forever. I won't forgive. I won't forget. 

And when I leave,you'll never get me back. 
With one handful of emptiness and a fistful of anger,I will leave your world and never come back.

I'll just turn and leave forever. I won't forgive. I won't forget.",Never,2004

Who stabbed our backs
With words of doubt 
And faith to match
You left us sullen
We rose above
Just in time

The capricious fuel the fire
The kindred tow the line
We take it on the chin
Rewind and start again
We waded through the mire
We slashed and set on fire
We always saw it coming
Had your number

To all the ones
Who shifted blame
To dreams
Of high resolution
We called your bluff
Called you out
Dropped you at sunrise

We offered you our dreams
With open arms
Wasn't enough
So good riddance",The Capricious,2003

Held the heart
Of a child
Inside of you

Took on the 
Roles expected

Who fit the scene

Let this world
Drag you down
But it has finally

[Chorus]
And I 
Can't help but feel responsible
For the change I've seen
In you
Who weeps 
On the inside
While my heart 
Screams with you

I'll always
Cherish the boy
You try so hard
To leave behind

Circumstance
Fend the vision
That has come
To cripple you

If I 
Could take it back
I'd let you go
I'd watch you bloom
