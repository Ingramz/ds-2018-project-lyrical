Glen Campbell,"(How do I tell my heart not to break)
Today I met you on the street I smiled at you and then I tried to speak
But you just turned around and walked away
Tell me what could I do oh what can I say how do I tell my heart not to break
On down the street I saw you run to him
He seemed so happy holdin' you again how many times will he kiss you tonight
Tell me what could I do oh what can I say how do I tell my heart not to break
I know how to tell my eyes to stop crying
I know how to tell my hands not to shake
I know how to tell my friends not to be concerned
But how do I tell oh but what do I say how do I tell my heart not to break
Please don't break how do I tell my heart not to break

Glen Campbell,"Every time I see her passing by all I do is hang my head and cry
And I can't forget her so I've tried all I do is hang my head and cry

Glen Campbell,"There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends who you knew in the city
And now they finally brought you home to me
When you left you told me someday you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Now everyone is watching you finally got your dream
You're riding in a long black limousine
The papers told of how you lost your life the party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see
And now you're in that long black limousine
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams
Are with you in that long black limousine",Long Black Limousine,1963
Glen Campbell,"Oh you tell me that you love me 
Yes you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married 
But tomorrow's never there
Many weeks have I waited 
Many many long nights have I cried
Just to see that happy morning happy morning 
When I'd have you right by my side
But tomorrow it never never comes 
No no no tomorrow ain't never ever gonna come
Now you tell me you tell me you love me
Can you say that you want me
But tomorrow never comes",Tomorrow Never Comes,1963
Glen Campbell,"Arkansas, land of opportunity
Arkansas, oh, what you do to me
Prettiest place I ever saw
Was back home in Arkansas

Lakes and rivers and Backwood trees
Gentle mountains, it reached to the sky
Oh, how I hated to say goodbye to

Dirt roads that lead nowhere
Except the houses that need repairing
And front porch people wearing a smile
And they cover every mile of

Glen Campbell,"Now darling you know I love you so well yes I love you more than words could ever tell
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine
But now you've gone and left me with trouble on my mind
Now someday you may be lonesome too walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking it won't hurt you to cry
Just remember that I love you and I will the day I die

Before you call him a man?

Glen Campbell,"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone, 
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry, I want to die

It's not unusual to go out at any time,
But when I see you out and about it's just a crime,
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual, it happens every day, 
No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time 

Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine.

It's not unusual to be mad with anyone,
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at any time
It's not unusual, to find that I'm in love with you

Glen Campbell,"I see that worried look upon your face, 
You've got your troubles, I got mine.
She's found somebody else to take your place;
You've got your troubles, I got mine.
I too have lost my love today, 
All of my dreams have flown away.
Now just like you I sit and wonder why; 
You've got your troubles, I got mine.
You need some sympathy, well so do I,
You've got your troubles, I got mine.
She used to love me, that I know, 
And it don't seem so long ago 
That we were walking, that we were talking
The way that lovers do.
And so forgive me if I seem unkind,
You've got your troubles, I got mine.
(Counter: And it must seem to you, my friend 
That I ain't got no pity for you, 
Well, that ain't true, 
You see I love that little girl, little girl, little girl.)

Glen Campbell,"Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall
Your love for me is over but sweet me'ries I still recall
Each season brings its changes but in me there's been no change at all
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
I thought some day I'll forget you but the chances now seem very small
There's too much of you still here with me to ever forget you at all
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall

Glen Campbell,"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall, that's all.

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go.",By the Time I Get to Phoenix,1967
Glen Campbell,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound,

All the troubles come my way
But I just won't worry
I'll be lucky someday.

My money's gone, ain't got no friends
More debts than I can face
But I just won't worry
I'll be lucky someday.

Let it rain, oh, let it pour
'Cause it just can't get worst no way
And I know maybe soon
My luck will change someday.

Glen Campbell,"I know that it would make you cry to find that I have gone didn't even say goodbye
You'll hate me for a while because I promised love and left you just regret
I know that I could never be the kind of man that you have in your mind of me
Though you said we must part it would break your heart
But you're young and you'll forget

You're young and I know time will help you find a perfect man to really love you
And not a man like me who's like the wind and must be free
But a man who's worthy of you

You'll be glad someday for you're young and you'll forget

A man in Kentucky sure is lucky to love down in Bowling Green
Bowling Green folks treat you kind better you think your own mind
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky in Bowling Green you walk your own line
Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold
It warms your body and I know it touches the soul

Glen Campbell,"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind
To feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind
When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now t'would be the sweetest thing t'would make me sing
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind

When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears
To help me leave all my blues behind

When through a sleepy haze, I see her lyin' there
Soft as the rain, that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight, shinin' on her golden hair

When I awake, and see her there so close besi-ide me
I want to take, her in my arms, the ache is there
So deep insi-ide me

Glen Campbell,"I spend the night in a chair thinkin' she'll be there but she never comes
And then I wake up and wiped the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day without her

It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door of an empty room
And then you go inside and sat at the table for one
It's no fun when you spend the day without her
We burst the pretty baloon it took us to the Moon
Such a beautiful thing bit it's ended now
But it sounds like a lie if I say I'd rather die than live without her

With your hand resting in mine I feel a power so divine

Glen Campbell,"I was born in southland twenty some odd years ago
I ran away for the first time when I was four years old
I'm a freeborn man my home is on my back
I know every inch of highway every foot of backroad every mile of rairoad track

I got a gal Cincinnati I got a woman in San Antone
I've always loved the girl next door but any place is home
I'm a freeborn man...

Got me a worn out guitar I carry in an old coal sack
I've hocked it bout two hundred times but I always get it back
I'm a freeborn man...

May not like the way I talk but you'll like me when I'm gone

Glen Campbell,"Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that's made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old

I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you all clothes that your young body crave
But if you'll say that you just love me and always be mine
Just think of the tears the heartaches and sorrow you'll save

While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
But to this old world I'll soon say my farewell at last
Cause I will be gone when you read this last letter from me",Last Letter,1968

where my poor restless heart's gotta run.
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done,

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon

And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Performed by Glen Campbell 
To dream the impossible dream 
To fight the unbeatable foe 
To bear with unbearable sorrow 
To run where the brave dare not go 
To right the unrightable wrong 
To love pure a chaste from a far 
To try when your arms are too weary 
To reach the unreachable star 
This is my quest to follow that star 
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far 
To fight for a right 

Without question or pause 
To be willing to march into hell 
For a heavenly cause 
And I know, if I'll only be true 
To this glorious quest 
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest

Have you got cheating on your mind, on your mind
I've seen the way men look at you
When they think I don't see
And it hurts to have them think that you're that kind
But it's knowing that you're looking back
That's really killing me

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

Pretty pencils to write ""I love you""

Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by

'Cause she makes me feel like a great big man
I'm a gonna go tell her mama what I think about her say thank you ma'am
For giving me your daughter Ann

She sure is stacked from her toes to the pretty little nape
Of her neck she's packed like a seed in a grape she's smooth as marble skin
When I see her I believe I'm a real young guy
And every time I go to work I think I might die if I can't hurry home again

If the good Lord worked all night a makin' me a female plan
I'd say no thanks Lord I'll just keep Ann

How could I ever look at any other woman when I've got Ann
Oh I feel so good when she takes my hand
I'm a gonna go tell her daddy what I think about her say thank you man
For giving me your daughter Ann

When I come home and I feel like I've been run over
By a ten-ton truck she can rub my shoulders and soothe my aches and pains
If I lose my job and I'm down to a silver dollar
And I feel like a dried up gourd in a holler she soothes my brow like summer rain

Glen Campbell,"Pity a man for he don't know
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road

When a man is one and twenty he thinks he knows it all
He can't see down the road of life where he'll ever fall
But fall he will as he travels through life
With all its pitfalls troubles and strife

Now at 50 he's goin' real strong
He has him a family and a nice little home
But old age is creeping up his spine
And the day is comin' when the sun won't shine

Now at 60 he won't have to guess
He's already missed the boat that leads to success
But he's done his best and he can't see why
The fame of life just passed him by

Now at 70 he can see the light
And he knows he's never been very bright
But he's done his best as he's travelled by
And now all he can do is just sit and sigh

Pity a man for he don't know
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road

Now at 80 he's ready for the wreath
He's wore out his hair and two sets of teeth
He has rheumatism in his hands and feet
And nothin' seems good to eat

So you can pity him as he goes up the line
As he wobbles on the spindle and his almost blind
And you can tell by the way that he travels alone
That it won't be long before he's goin' home

But if he's kept the commandments as he's travelled through life
He'll have a home in heaven where there'll be no strife
He's worked all his life to get things the way he wants 'em
He comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed",Fate of Man,1968

A seeker of fortune, connoisseur of great wines
Dashin' through meadows of yellow and green
Tryin' to catch the impossible dream

A-drinkin' tequila goin' out of my mind
Havin' a ball on a couple 'a bob
A-treatin' the ladies to corn on the cob
A-leavin' the straight life behind

Hummin' a song in the sun and the rain

I can just see me on a tropical island
A-ridin' the surf and drinkin' coconut wine
Havin' me fun with the girls in the sand
Chasin' the sun through an innocent land

At seven she'll throw a kiss towards the door and smile at my empty chair
For there's nothing there for a man to cling to nothing to pull me back home
Only a girl that's a stranger to me breathing on flames that are gone
Home isn't where I hang up my hat every night

And home isn't anything like cold arms holding me tight that's not right
And home isn't some place to go just to feel all alone that's not home

And maybe I'll find home someday",That's Not Home,1968

So I work real hard to strike it rich but every time I do

When everything's ain't going right, I hurry home to you
You kiss my lips and you comfort me as only you can do
But the eagle flies on Friday night and my senses fly off too
How come every time I itch I wind up scratchin' you

I dream of coming home to you; a knight in shining armor
'Cause it seems to me that you rate much more
Than a broken down, busted farmer

Glen Campbell,"Friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving God
And they're precious beyond human evaluation
But you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke
And the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless nights
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
Somewhere where nothing much ever happens
But a few of my friends are big people
They'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court
They're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words
And yet they're no more precious in God's eyes or in mine
Than those wonderful nobody's who live and die in small towns
Who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement and concern
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
The most important thing they have in common is their ability
To share with you your most sky splitting joys
Or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends",Friends,1969

Could make me doubt you as far as I'm concerned.

Than to look for happiness with someone new
For always in my heart there'll be a flame that burns
For you alone dear as far as I'm concerned.

Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew when I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
I've lived I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing

And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me I did it my way

Well, I never thought that I could make it alone
Thought I would die but I seem to carry on
And I thought my life would surely leave
And, though almost, I have not ceased to be

And even though I thought I lost everything
Today I found that the birds still sing in the morning
And the world keeps spinning 'round
And the world keeps spinning 'round

When someone says goodbye, another dream ends
And just before you give up another dream begins
Someone changed their mind, tears fall to the ground
But you know that one man's smile is another's frown

And the table will turn someday, that's how life is
I have no doubt 'cause you know that time don't stand still
All the world keeps spinning 'round
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round

Dawn will find me here and I think about
One that I thought I couldn't live without
One day she was here, the next day gone
But the love that was never clear was just alone

And how can you lose something you only thought
That you found so you wipe away the tears with a smile
All the world keeps spinning 'round
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round
All the world keeps spinning 'round
All the world keeps spinning 'round

Sweet country girl it's not hard to believe
Pretty flowers bloom wherever she's been walking uh-huh

Shadows erase in the last light of day night time is startin' to settle
Red colored stone Lord is leading my way to her cottage way down in the meadow

Big cities far behind me well it's love with her to think I'm a gonna stay

That bompy little couch that made into a bed
Shower down the hall and footsteps through the wood
She said, ""It's just fine""

Times were hard for us for quite a while
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile
Not wanting me to know she's carrying my child
She tried to ease my mind

And for my woman's love, for my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love

Through the years of moving town to town
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found
And wondering if we would ever settle down
Her love never died

And if I have many things today
I owe it to the love I had along the way
No matter what went wrong, no matter come what may
She stood by my side

And for my woman's love, for my woman's love

And you don't want to be where you are
Where do you run when there's no run to run and you've already run too far
What good is love when you offer your love but nobody wants to buy
Why do I cry and why am I wondering why
What can you say when there's so much to say but nobody listens to you
And what good are dreams if there's no more than dreams
That don't have a chance to come true
And what can you do when love that you do will ease your troubled mind
And where do you go when you come to the end of the line
What can you say...

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for

I found the love that I couldn't ignore

But quickly drove away.

Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me
Her lips were like the scented flowers
Inside a rain-drenched forest

But that was so long ago
That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away
That I might bleed some more

The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground we walked upon
Those were good days

The last time I held her hand
Her touch was autumn spring
And summer and winter too
The last time I let go of her
She walked away into the night

I lost her in the misty streets
A thousand months, a thousand years
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is

The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And she walked alone
The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves

Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten

So what my friend if all your dreams you have and realized
Just look around you you got a whole new day to try

Today is mine today is mine to do with what I will
Today is mine my own special cup to fill
To die a little that I might learn to live to take from life that I might learn to give
Today is mine

Like most men I cursed the present to avoid the peace of mind
And raise my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind
But as I view this day around me I can see the fool I've been
For today's the only garden we can tend
Today is mine...",Today Is Mine,1971
Glen Campbell,"Today I may not have a thing at all except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you
Right now it may not seem like spring at all we're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you
No one knows better than I that love keeps passing me by that way
But with you there at my side I'll soon be turning the tide just away
As long as I've got arms to cling at all it's you I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream beg or borrow on some bright tomorrow will all come true
And all my tomorrows belong to you
As long as I've got arms to cling at all...

Glen Campbell,"Feeling of loneliness that I can feel right now
Love has looked at me but tried to change me
I wished that love would take me just for what I am.

Just for what I am I want someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me to feel like that old memory
Just for what they see just for being me

I want someone to love me just for what I am.
Cry ain't just a sound it's a sadness
Sadness that lives with me and follows me around
Love wants me to be someone I can't be
I wished that love would take me just for what I am.

In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
Are you going away with no word of farewell will there be not a trace left behind
I could have loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You've got reasons of plenty for going this I know Lord this I know

Pawn shops itching for your old guitar
Where you've gone, it ain't nobody knows
The sequins have fallen from your clothes

Once you heard the Opry crowd applaud
Now you're hanging out at 4th and Broad
On the rain wet sidewalk, remembering the time
When coffee with a friend was still a dime

[Chorus]
Everything's been sold American
The early times are finished and the want ads are all read
Everyone's been sold American
Been dreaming dreams in a roll away bed

Writing down your memoirs on some window in the frost
Roulette eyes reflecting another morning lost
Hauled in by the metro for killing time and pain
With a singing brakeman screaming through your veins

You told me you were born so much higher than life
I saw the faded pictures of your children and your wife
Now they're fumbling through your wallet & they're trying to find your name
It's almost like they raised the price of fame

Her father thinks that I will leave her crying
But I know she would follow me right down the roughest road
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon
And when I come to call her pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's cause he's just as wild in his younger days

To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed 
That you belonged to me

Lord, it felt so fine

Through the mountains and the pines
And then the darkness fell
And the moon's a harsh mistress
It's so hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart

But I know that I am just another man
And in knowing that I know that I'll get more or less what I can get

But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning.
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together.
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.

Lay your head on my pillow.
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
Blowin' soft against the window,
And make believe you love me one more time,
For the good times.

Glen Campbell,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

And it seems a little sadder

'Cause it's a shame to make
The same mistakes again
And again
It's over.

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

Glen Campbell,"If you see your brother standing by the road
With a heavy load from the seeds he's sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way
Just stop and say, you're going the wrong way

You got to try a little kindness
Yes show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets

Don't walk around the down and out
Lend a helping hand instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day
Will help someone along their way

You got to try a little kindness
Yes show a little kindness
Just shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets

Glen Campbell,"Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him and he blames her
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is

And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again

Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for
A stranger here, a stranger there
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more

And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return

And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy kiss
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

",Cheatin' Is [#][*],1979
Glen Campbell,"I was a highwayman.
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder.
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around.

I fly a star ship.
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...",Highwayman,1979

When baby you walked in my world that day
Then you looked right into my eyes and a voice that could make the devil cry
You just sang my poor heart away
Friends may come and friends may go but lovers either stay
Or break your heart oh you just fall apart
I thought I could take it or leave it but I can't hardly believe it
But nobody ever sang a song about me before
And I begged you baby as you walked out the door
Please don't play my song for somebody else
It's so beautiful let me keep it for myself
Please don't change the chorus and put in another man's name
Please don't take my song away oh baby please don't take my song away

I heard a voice that made me shiver

Why I took this time to write
The cards and letters there's been to few of those
But I just stopped to realize
How long that I've been gone
But there's a few small things I need to know.

Dear Daddy do the whipperwill still echo through the night?
Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light?
And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road?
I miss you so.

Well years keep slipping by me
Like miles out on the road
But I don't guess I'll change my way of life
There's no harm in holding memories
But please tell me if you can
If I can bring those old times inside.

Dear Mama can you still find the dipper in the stars?
Do the roads still go for hours without cars?
Does the frost still shine on the grass outside the door?
Just like before
Tell me more.

Is Sis still planning marriage sometime soon?
Can you still reach out and touch the moon?
Do old songs still ring out through the hills for days and days?

Glen Campbell,"Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love where did I go wrong
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Thrown its chilly arms around me

I search for all that's truth and bright

And see the lamp of Gods tonight

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Look at Frosty go.
Thumpetty thump thump,
Thumpety thump thump,
Over the hills of snow.

Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day,
So he said, ""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away.""
Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""
For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
""Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day.""

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

And then showed me how to live it
And taught me that you measure love
By how freely you can give it

Is the lesson that I learned
That when a love is true
It has nothing in return

Unconditional love, that they gave to me
It wasn't mine to keep and I knew someday
I'd hand it down to you and hope that I can be
The one who makes you see
The importance of unconditional love

And there were times I know I let them down
But never once was I rejected
And when I stood alone to face this world
Somehow I still felt protected

And it will last through the years
And you can trust that I'll be there
Through the good times and the tears

Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink.

'Bout the man back home in Kansas

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.

I couldn't really see

Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines.

Glen Campbell,"She may be weary, women do get weary 
Wearing the same shabby dress 
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness 

She may be waiting, just anticipating 
Things she may never possess 
While she's without them, try a little tenderness 

It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care 
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds

That keeps you in the back roads

That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can

Glen Campbell,"I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around....
And around and around and around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman [Live],2003

My friend I'll say it clear, I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've lived, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got if not himself then he has not
To say the things, he truly feels and not the worlds of one who kneels

Waking to the sunlight, being cradled by the moon
Catching fireflies at night, building castles in the sand
Kissing mama's face goodnight and holding daddy's hand
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

Running barefoot through the grass, a little hide and go seek
Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground

Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me

And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe

Glen Campbell,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind [*],2006
Glen Campbell,"I was alright for a while, I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello

Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Since you said so long left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying
I thought that I was over you but it's true so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling, what can I do for you?
No, don't love me and I'll always be

To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep

Glen Campbell,"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.
I hope you had the time of your life.

Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time

For what it's worth it was worth all the while

I don't do that much talking these days

These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days

These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'll see another highway

I'll keep on moving
I'm bound to be improving these days
These days

And if I seem to be afraid to live the life
That I have made and sown
It's just that I've been healing so long

I've stopped my dreaming

Sunday morning
Sun shining from your eyes
Sleepy face 
Smiling into mine

Sunday morning
Lots of time with nothing to do
Lots of time to spend with you
On Sunday morning

It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday morning

Sunday morning, Sunday morning, Sunday, Sunday
I love Sunday, Sunday morning

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything's alright
Sunday morning
Everything's alright

Like a ghost on the canvas
People don't see them!

No, they never see soul!

Others they color their dreams

The spirit always knows what it sees

Never can have us

And folding out mysteriously
Where lies the chance we take to be
Always working
Reaching out for a hand that we
Can't see
Everybody's got a hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me

Invitation to the last dance
Then it's time to leave
But that's the price we pay
When we deceive
One another animal mother
She opens up for free
Everybody's got a hold on hope
It's the last thing that's
Holding me

Look at the talkbox in mute
Frustration
At the station
There hides the cowboy
His campfire flickering
On the landscape

That nothing grows on
But time still goes on
And through each life of misery
Everybody's got a hold on hope
It's the last thing that's holding me",Hold on Hope,2011

Glen Campbell,"Dear friend of my mine
Weather's fine
Today, I saw some ruins
Of the Roman world's decline

And I climbed all those Spanish steps
You've heard of them no doubt
But Rome has lost its glory
I don't know what it's about

I wish you were here
When the shadows fall
And all the rushing traffic's still

I wish you were here
When the bells are ringing
On the seven hills

I make my way to a small cafe
I wonder what you did today
Wish you were here

Dear one at home
I just flew in from Rome
And Paris is a postcard
All decked out in color chrome

And so, I climbed the Eiffel Tower
And prayed at Notre Dame
But I just can't find the romance
And I wonder why I came

I wish you were here
On the Champs Elysees
Lovers walk hand in hand

I wish you were here
They take one look at me
And seem to understand

This city of light is a lovely site
The first bright star I see tonight
Wish you were here

Now, I write this from the plane
Drinking cheap champagne
And wondering why
Two people got so far apart

I wish you were here
Here in London
Where the rain the pouring down

I wish you were here
On this airplane
Headed back to New York Town

I'll never leave you alone again
I'm coming home but until then
Wish you were here

I wish you were here
Wish you were here",Postcard from Paris [Alternate Mix] [*],2013

With two girls in a light blue Desoto
One's names was Jane
The other was plain
But they both had racing motors

Next I caught a ride with a gamblers wife
She had a brand new laid down Rambler
She parked outside of town
And laid the rambler down
And said she sure could dig it if I rode her

I'm doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing' I'd rather do
Look for me someday
I'm gonna be there, honey
With something special just for you

At a truck stop for toothpick and water
Caught a ride with a fruit picker's daughter
We drove into the night
Said 'The fruit's just right'
She said all I could eat for a quarter

Next I caught a ride with a hobo woman
Who said she was from Texas too
The way she did what she did
When she did, what she did to me
Made me think of you

Bet all my money on a race horse baby
One they said can't lose
Now I'm down here in the pouring rain
Trying to get to you, Trying to get to you

And I'm walking and I'm talking to myself
And it's raining and I'm freezing to death
Trying to get to you, trying to get to you

Make sure your clock has a snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover

Glen Glenn,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana,
Rode into town one day.
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion,
And walkin' behind was a bay.
The red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder,
And his lips, they were sad and tight.
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,
And his heart was heavy as night. 
Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window,
An' watched as he passed her way.
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion,
But cast greedy eyes on the bay.
But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony,
Meant more to him than life.
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin',
Had ridden when she was his wife.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern,
An' looked up the stranger there.
He bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money,
He just didn't seem to care.
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion,
An' laughed as she grabbed at the bay.
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her,
She never heard anyone say:

""Don't cross him, don't boss him.
""He's wild in his sorrow:
""He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
""Don't fight him, don't spite him;
""Just wait till tomorrow,
""Maybe he'll ride on again.""

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset;
The stranger went free, of course.
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman,
Who's tryin' to steal your horse.
Tthis is the tale of the red headed stranger,
And if he should pass your way,
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion,
And don't lay a hand on the bay.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum
And don't we have a lot of fun

Ha, ha, ha, you and me
Little brown jug, don't I love thee
Ha, ha, ha, you and me
Little brown jug, don't I love thee
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose
Tip her up and down she goes

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear

If I'd a cow that gave such milk
I'd dress her in the finest silk
Feed her up on oats and hay
And milk her twenty times a day

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk
She jumped the fence and strained her milk

And when I die don't bury me at all
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep

The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop

And no hero out of books 
Is my man

That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too

He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Glen Gray,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

I've come to say goodbye,

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Glen Gray,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2001

No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2003

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

You took so many through the light
And now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart

Well the ruins of man, the bloody rag
Neither fool the bull, the powdered hag
The nights they make the rattle rag
The wolves that follow the outed man
The falling star, the way we are, divine
The rules that never ever multiply

You must have fallen from the sky
You must have come here on the wrong way
You came among us every time
But now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart

Well, they call you saint, the basket case
The rules of thumb you have to break
The raging skull, the rag to the bull
The nails that drag in either hand

But I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me
And always fool me

And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
You'll make it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black
You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

You'll make it now

Or am I dreaming
I can't tell dreams from truth

I think of you smiling
With pride in your eyes

Satisfy me

Are you really sure
That you believe me
When others say I lie
I wonder if you could

To be a better one to satisfy you

This might be it for me and you
Maybe we can draw that line
Maybe another time.
Well I wanna do what's right
But maybe not tonight.

Memories of another town
Those pretty eyes, that pretty frown.
In the long grass where we lay 
And let the whole world fall away.
And though in time we've walked apart,
You were always in my heart
Maybe we should say goodbye
But maybe not tonight.

I remember you were just a child
Burning brightly and running wild
We married on an August night 
No priest, no church, just the big moon shining bright.
Maybe we should be moving on,
And figure what is done is done
Maybe we should break those vows
But maybe not right
Maybe we should do what's right
But baby not tonight.
Maybe we should both just do what's right
But baby not tonight.",Maybe Not Tonight,2012

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
I said, 'Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'
She said, 'I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around'

[Chorus]
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
'Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?'
He said, 'Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?'

[Chorus]
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, 'I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog'
I said, 'Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man'
He said, 'That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can'

[Chorus]
Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line

To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone",The Weight,2017

Still as beautiful as first day we met
But something's different, doesn't seem so long ago
Amazing how the years can go

When we wanted different things
You wanted a family, I was chasing my dream
I didn't know what I had back then
How could I go off through the growing pains of being a man?

I really didn't understand
I took you for granted, now it's out of my hands
Now I wish I had it to do all over again

'Cause all I do is dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it
I just close my eyes, I just close my eyes and dream

Don't know what I had thought I really figured out
Looking back had no clue what it was all about
I tried to explain what I was feeling but when I couldn't get through
I would just turn around and get mad at you

Frustrated not knowing the reasons for the things I do
Couldn't see just why you and I would fall apart
Humble by drift and heart
But now I can clearly see how things ended up because of me
If this is how it's supposed to be then I'll just

Dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it

Wishing it could be that way again
But even if it can't be, and we we're made just friends

The biggest love that's for sure

Girl, it's plain to see
What you mean to me
Still in love with you
Want you to be my boo
What we gonna do?

It's never too late
Don't wait 'fore we lose it all
You're my love, the only one I'm thinkin' of
It's never too late
Don't wait 'fore we lose it all
Oh, don't think twice and let this love pass you by

It's never too late
Don't wait 'fore we lose it all
My missin' part, baby, finish what you started
It's never too late
Don't wait 'fore we lose it all
And any chance to be, don't take that away from me, oh baby, listen

No, no, no, no
Never too late
No, no, never too late, baby

It's never too late
Don't wait 'fore we lose it all
You're my love, the only one I'm thinkin' of

",Never Too Late,2002
Glen Lewis,"I told her, deeper than the deepest ocean
Vast as the universe, high like any mountain top
Put your world in reverse
Ain't nothing in these words rehearsed

So maybe we can make a first
Let me begin with a simple phrase
I'm a sinner for lovin' you the way I do
Life's been peaks and valleys with winds of change
Still loving you was all the same

I never believed that love could be for me
Now I see clearly you were meant for me
And now I know the truth is to be with you
'Cause I know your love will always be there

So maybe if you give me
Maybe just one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe we can make it
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

And if you hold on
Maybe give me one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe make it better
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

Find out how deep this love can go
'Cause there ain't no guarantee
You leave or stay with me that anyways the right way
But surely we gon' make today, understood

If you would I'll be good
Knowing at times you couldn't stand it
Feeling taken for granted but I'm here to tell you, baby
I ain't going nowhere, I'ma be right here

Best believe, if love is all you need
Ooo, wee, baby, thick like gravy
Ups and downs, highs and lows
Where we'll stop only love knows

So maybe if you give me
Maybe just one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe we can make it
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

And if you hold on
Maybe give me one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe make it better
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

It ain't gonna be this way
We can work it out if we take our time
You know that it ain't gonna be this way
We can work it out if we take our time

So maybe if you give me
Maybe just one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe we can make it
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

And if you hold on
Maybe give me one more day

The way it feel
So good to me
Make me feel, so real, real, yeah
Said it's alright, said it's alright

Family shade from a tree, special memories
'Bout the way it used to be
Hanging on the corner
Doing what you wanna, so happy

Out at the movies with ya love
Feeling high above
Any troubles you'd have
Just being glad to be alive and it's alright

It feels so good

Glen Lewis,"I was thinking you and me 
Could start again, fulfill a dream 
Read that somewhere we would find, paradise 
Walls of change have clearly fell 
Sure with loves cry out for help 
If you'd only try with me and see that we 

Should be trying to find a 'cause 
Before a problem flaws 
But know that just to be with, you in a love that truly free 
That could be you and me 

It was something to see, 'cause you know we're too far gone 
To ever be, the same way we been so long 
It was something to see, we can make it if we hold on 
The way it should be, with love leading us along 
  
Love so beautiful to me, now's the chance for all to see 
All you need is to believe, that love's the key 
With peace between us, you and me, then a crystal city's where we could be 
Then there'd be no mystery, just free to be 

Only trying to find a cause, 
Before a problem flaws 
But know that just to be with you, and in love was all it was 
It should ever be because 

It was something to see cause you know we're too far gone 
To ever be, the same way we been so long

Glen Lewis,"Look at what a mess I made
If I paid attention, maybe then you might have stayed
Deserted you, in the middle of the night
One to many times and askin' why

Where did all the promises go?
Of love you had, not like you don't hear me though
That's what she said to me
I treated it like it was talk just something momentary

Now she's leaving from me being, neglecting of her heart
How I regret it now and I don't know how
I let it get this bad but now I wish
I had the chance to tell you my baby

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

You first left I, blamed it on everything but myself
Girlfriends talking to someone else
Present the picture doin' all I'm supposed to do
Getting close to you

Woke up from my sleep 'cause I couldn't breathe
From my heart being so weak if only my tears could speak
They'd say, it was such a mistake
Still I love you babe, hey babe

And now she's leaving from me being, neglecting of her heart
How I regret it now and I don't know how
I let it get this bad but now I wish
I had the chance to tell you my baby

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Just before you said bye bye

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

Tell me what I'm supposed to do
Now that you left me this way
Friends tell you don't be talkin' bout
Your love oh I can't do without that

Now what am I supposed to do?
Life just helplessly whithers away
Tell me if you would ever have that feeling
Like life itself just ain't have no meaning

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

So sorry, sorry

",Sorry,2002
Glen Lewis,"It was in November
When while out one night with friends
That I saw her there
She was just standing there

Something in her distant stare
A faint look of despair
To her I was drawn
Asked her was anything wrong

I told her my name
Said how you do
'Bouts to say you take care
It was nice to meet you

Then she stopped me desperately
As if to say don't go, but then she said to me

""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""
""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""

Not knowing what to say
But I could see
She was going thru some things
And needed someone to be
There to listen, probably wishing
She was someone else

And in my heart felt bad
And I just knew I had
'Cause I'd want the same myself
So we got into it
And while she talked I thought to myself
How could it be

That she'd have no one, not even a friend to come
And she'd have to turn to me and say

""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""
""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""

Seeking the wrong kind of attention
Always in abusive situations
And don't know how she got it good
Was starting to sound like it could be
The reason for misery

Slowly I could see
She had problems nothing
I or anyone could say or do
Would help what she was going thru

Then suddenly, she stood up across from me
And as loud as she could be, screaming out
""Some one help me please""
Realizing she was gone wishing I'd mind my own saying

Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy

And you need someone to love you babe

'Cause baby I can take you high

Whenever you need me

But I can't seem to let you go

Glen Lewis,"I have cried all night
Trying to make it better
I recognize my pain
Things are getting harder
For us to be in this love

And my tears wash away my smile
And I'm drowning in my sorrow
There's no hope for today
I can't see my tomorrow
'Cause we are no longer in love

This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love
This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love, love, love

I've been blazed all day
Dreading confrontation
I've waited until now
For this conversation to take place
That we're wasting time

With this love, I'm trying to be nice
Don't want you to be a hater
We've had our beautiful sons
So we gotta be one, sooner or later
'Cause we've got so much more, than this love

This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love
This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love, love, love

Can we still be, can we still be friends?
It will all end in tears if we decide
To leave, but stay, I'm so confused
I cant go on this way, I just can't go on, on this way

This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love
This love, your love, our love
It used to be our love, love, love

What happened to my love baby?
Now we got to think about our sons
So now it's over babe, now it's over baby, babe

",This Love,2002
Glen Lewis,"Wear a disguise, I see it in your eyes
Afraid to give, once a heart willing to try
The love you had found, again would let you down
Locked away, now a heart longing to die

So unsure and feeling insecure
Your heart just can't endure to rise above and fly
Set you free to bring you back to me
The promise that you'll be, keeper to my, my heart

Now on we go to where no one knows
But I know that I love you even more
Tears we cry asking myself why
Did I let the only one that I love go?
You were meant for me
Darling, can't you see this is your song?

Now where you are, forever seems so far
Feels like I could never love again
Wishing you were here to take away my fears
And life without you's a pain I couldn't bare

So afraid, you'd hurt if I had stayed
Despite all you had gave, I held it all inside
Gave your all but soon I'd let you fall
Not meaning to at all, I realized, can't deny

Now on we go to where no one knows
But I know that I love you even more
Tears we cry asking myself why
Did I let the only one that I love go?
You were meant for me
Darling, can't you see this is your song, your song?

Follow me
I'll show you the way
To a brighter day
Upon the wings of our love

Turn off the moon, do it soon
I can't enjoy this night without you 
Shake down the stars
Dry up the streams
Stop all my dreams.

Cut off the breeze, do it please
I never thought I'd cry about you 
Shake down the stars 

I gave you my arms, my lips, my heart
My love, my life, my all
But the best that I had to offer you 
I found was all too small

Glen Miller,"The sky fell down when I met you 
The green of the countryside had turned to blue 
I had the moon right on my fingertips 
And when first we kissed 
There were stars on your lips

You gave to me all this and heaven, too

And I met you!",The Sky Fell Down,2012
Glen Miller,"Skylark, have you anything to say to me, 
Won't you tell me where my love can be? 
Is there a meadow in the mist 
Where someone's waiting to be kissed? 

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring 
Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? 

And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night? 
Wonderful music, faint as a will-'o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, 
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things, 
But my heart is riding on your wings 
So if you see them anywhere 
Won't you lead me there",Skylark,2012

That night of love and glory 
A night that left my heart romantic scars 
We stood so near to heaven 
That I reached clear to heaven 
And gathered you a handful of stars 

Sweet remembered hour 
When love began to flower 
With moonlight through the trees like silver balls 
And as the moon grew older 
I reached across your shoulder 
And gathered you a handful of stars 

I placed my fingertips upon your lips 
And stars fell in your eyes 
Moonglow made a halo of your hair 
Suddenly you looked at me and dreams began to rise 
Oh, what things unspoken trembled in the air

And then our lips were meeting 
And Venus seemed to melt right into Mars 
Then while we stood caressing

Who's giving that line to you?
You think it's divine, do you?
You're a crazy Humpty Dumpty heart.
You're letting a grin kid you,
You never did win, did you?
Just a silly Humpty Dumpty heart.
Don't mean to criticize, or say I'm wise,
But if you will just recall, you sat on a garden wall,
And you know what happened
You'll still have a chance won't you?
You sure want romance, don't you 
Hope, you're lucky, Humpty Dumpty heart.

It was fated to be...

Steals across the meadows of my heart

The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

I tried to speak but couldn't, Dad was whistling and drinking beer

Jumped up and he ran away
Dad had shot right through his chain

Glen Phillips,"There comes a time in life
To pull on your coat and go outside
To taste the vinegar of life, bitter life
To taste a second time, its sweet surprise
Sweet surprise

It's not that hard to figure it out
When there's no question, there's no doubt
I burned an effigy to time, senseless time
To view the miracle, but the wine still was wine
And that was my crime

There is a face in the stone
We let it out to find its form
To shape the testament of will, strongest will
Pride, humility, a bitter pill

Sweet surrender, oh my Lord
I never thought I'd see

You'd give yourself to anybody
Who would cross that line

And it was never a question
He was (you were) crowing for repair
You'd give him love and affection
You couldn't keep him there

He was under the bed
And the more skin you shed
The more the air in your throat would linger
When you call him your friend

Forget the words that once rang so true
Did we expect that life was ever fair, my god...
I sowed a field of rose and reaped a whipping rod

And everything I've held too tight inside
Could make a part of me die
And if my lips could only speak the name
The dam would break

What is this ice that gathers 'round my heart
To stop the flood of warmth before it even starts
It would make me blind to what I thought would always be
The only constant in the world for me

And every hour of every day
I need to fight from pulling away
And if my mind could only loose the chain

And feet to take me where I want to stand
If there's work to be done
There's these two strong hands
I don't need anything that I don't have
I don't need anything that I don't have

Some years the rains don't come
And some years floods clear out the plains
If those waters washed this town away
I would still have enough
If she was with me

I've a roof overhead, the stars if I choose
But I've got no itch to fly, got no need to move
Got almost nothing

I was that birkenstock geek rock dude
You were the back flip, doe-eyed,
Tree-climbing, earth-mama, beautiful evergreen girl

And I never thought that I could be
Gettin' my grey hair with you beside me
And there's something I'm blind to but you still see

And it couldn't be better, I know
It shouldn't be easier to hold
I should stop waiting for the other boot to fall

I wanna be the toy in your cereal box
I wanna be Charter in your peace talks
I wanna get almost too familiar
But still notice the way that you walk

If you said you were going away
I'd run on the tarmac
And I would lay down in front of the plane
Just to get you to stay

'cause it couldn't be better, I know
It shouldn't be easier to hold
I should stop waiting for the other boot to fall

Got everything I'd ever wanted here
Everything, then this constant fear
I'm sure I'm gonna lose it all
Just waiting for the other boot to fall

If you thought I could be replaced
I wouldn't just stop w/ an ear
I would cut off my whole fuckin' face
Just to make my point clear

It shouldn't be easier to hold
I should stop waiting for the other boot to fall

His baby's curled up on a stranger's floor
Momma's thinking family dinners weren't too much to ask for

Everybody here's got a story to tell
Everybody's been through their own hell
There's nothing too special about getting hurt
But getting over it, that takes the work

One way or the other we'll all need each other
Nothing's gonna turn out the way you thought it would
Friends and lovers, don't you duck and cover
'Cause everything comes out the way it should

Blessed are the humble, blessed are the meek
Blessed are the hungry, blessed are the weak
Blessed are the ones on the other side
And blessed are we just for being alive

One day I stopped wanting anything at all
The heavens opened up like a waterfall
No use in worrying about when it ends
Just for now be thankful for what I get

One way or another a man's gonna suffer
Makes no difference the way you wanted it
But friends and lovers, don't you duck and cover
'Cause everything comes out the way it should in the end

Everyday, I promise (that)
I will change, the next day
New Years came
And everybody took the same vow we get it, better start it now

Awaken by degrees
Information as disease
The march of progress is
Kicking me lifeless
Good God, look at what we've lost
Built on a holocaust
Gave beads and blankets
For what was priceless

Everyday, I promise (that)
I will change, the next day
New Years came
And everybody took the same vow we get it, better start it now

Things are gonna change this time
Things are gonna change
Every empire has its day, then it fades
Things are gonna change
Things are gonna change

How come it got so bad?
The noblest experiment
Maybe its all done
We'll start a new one

Everyday, I promise (that)
I will change, the next day
New Years came
And everybody took the same vow we get it, better start it now

Everyday, I promise (that)

What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,1990
Glen Reynolds,"I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
‘Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in-
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light

Told me to tell y'all what I say today
Do the things that keep a smile on her face
Say the words that make her feel better ev'ry day
You bet you better keep on you Ps and Qs
If you don't the woman you can easily lose
Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it
No one seems to understand about the pain that it cost me

Woman's got to have it
I believe that I should know
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me

A woman's got to have it
I believe
She's got to know that she's that she's needed around
When you kiss her
You got to let her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground

So if you've got a love
And maybe you've got eyes to keep her
You've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it (all right)
How she wants it
And every doggone time she thinks she needs it

Your woman needs it
The same as mine
A woman got to have it

Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Behold the holy ones they come
I hear the sound of wings

Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings
To my immortal home",Angel Band,1999

And this is what I said

Well-a, well-a, well-a, well-a

And I did a lot more

At the grocery store

Now, Mom, you'll find
The key next door cause
This little girl's gone rocking

I left some biscuits for the pup
I put fresh water in his cup
And now I'm off
I'm gonna live it up cause
This little girl's gone rocking

Well, I'm be home about
Twelve tonight and not a
Minute, minute, minute later
Don't forget the front door lock
That's all for now
I'll see you later, mater

That you wanted done

Glenda Collins,"Johnny loves me
He just told me so last night (Johnny loves her)
Now each star I see belongs to me
And they're all shining twice as bright (Johnny loves her)
Johnny loves me
Johnny's heart is really mine (Johnny loves her)
Love is everywhere and I could swear
The world's a great big valentine
I feel so pretty, I'm all aglow
When he says I'm wonderful
He makes me feel it's so
Yes, Johnny loves me
Now each day is bright and new (Johnny loves her)
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through
""Johnny loves me and I love my Johnny, too""

Glenda Collins,"Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli
Lollipop lollipop...

Call my baby lollipop
Tell you why
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance
Man, I haven't got a chance

I call him 
Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli
Lollipop lollipop...

Sweeter than candy on a stick
Huckleberry, chimry or lime
If you had a choice
He'd be your pick
But lollipop is mine

Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli
Lollipop lollipop...

Crazy way he thrills me
Tell you why
Just like a lightning from the sky
He loves to kiss me till I can't see straight
Gee, my lollipop is great

I call him 
Lollipop lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lolli
Lollipop lollipop... ",Lollipop,1997
Glenda Collins,"If ever you got rain in your heart, 
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

And let it be like they said it would be 
Me loving you girl, and you loving me. 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me) 
Run to me if you need a shoulder 
Now and then, you need someone older, 
So darling, you run to me. 

And when youÂ´re out in the cold, 
No one beside you, and no one to hold, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

And when youÂ´ve got nothing to lose, 
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me) 
Run to me if you need a shoulder 
Now and then you need someone older, 
So darling, you run to me.",Run to Me [#],1997

Glendon Smith,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,2002
Glendon Smith,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,2002
