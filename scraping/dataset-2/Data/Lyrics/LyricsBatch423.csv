Jeff Hamilton,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love,2001
Jeff Hamilton,"All I want is a room somewhere
Far away from the cold night air
With one enormous chair
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Lots of chocolate for me to eat
Lots of coal makin' lots of heat
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still
I would never move till Spring crept over mi window sill

Someone's head restin' on my knee
Warm and tender as he can be
Who takes good care of me
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

Who takes good care of me
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? (loverly)
Loverly (lovely)
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?",Wouldn't It Be Loverly,2001
Jeff Hamilton,"There may be trouble ahead 
But while there's music and moonlight and love and romance 
Let's face the music and dance 

Before the fiddlers have fled 
Before they ask us to pay the bill and while we still have the chance 
Let's face the music and dance 

Soon we'll be without the moon, humming a different tune and then 
There may be teardrops to shed 
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance 
Let's face the music and dance

Soon we'll be without the moon, humming a different tune and then 
There may be teardrops to shed

Jeff Hamilton,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2004
Jeff Hamilton,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark

Jeff Hamilton,"Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a gota 
De orvalho numa pétala de flor 
Brilha tranquila 
Depois de leve oscila 
E cai como uma lágrima de amor 
A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusão do carnaval 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia 
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim 
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar 
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada 
É como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo, por favor 
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza não tem fim 
Felicidade sim",A Felicidade,2006
Jeff Hamilton,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Jeff Hamilton,"The dawn is filled with dreams
So many dreams, which one is mine
One must be right for me
Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars
So many stars

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine
One must be right for me
Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell
How will I know, out of, oh
So many stars, so many stars

Jeff Hamilton,"I have a feeling, it's a feeling
I'm concealing, I don't know why
It's just a mental, sentimental alibi

But I adore you
So strong for you
Why go on stalling
I am falling
Our love is calling
Why be shy?

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?

Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it

We might have an end for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love

We might have an end for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover

Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young

Let's fall in love",Let's Fall in Love,2007
Jeff Hamilton,"Nothing's impossible I have found
For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off, start all over again

Don't lose your confidence if you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again

Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired but you'll be a man my son
Don't you remember the famous men who had to fall to rise again?
They picked themselves up, dust themselves off and started all over again",Pick Yourself Up,2007
Jeff Hamilton,"Tell me that it's true
Tell me you agree
I was meant for you
You were meant for me

[Chorus: x2]
Dearly beloved, how clearly I see
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me
Angel eyes knew you
Angel voices led me to you
Nothing could save me
Fate gave me a sign
I know that I'll be yours come shower or shine
So I say merely
Dearly beloved, be mine",Dearly Beloved,2008
Jeff Hamilton,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by, flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Jeff Hamilton,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,2008
Jeff Hamilton,"I'm cool. I'm lookin after myself
As I would never place wealth before my spirit
I fear it's unhealthy, the devil creep around you so stealthy stealthy

Til ya get bold, rush the gold an before ya time is over
Ya soul is sold, where's it gettin ya?
Competition start swearin ya, goldiggers setting you up

Soon be forgetting your existence
Do ya need a for instance?
I hafta admit admire your persistence in stickin to a game plan
That brings ya pain man
And at the end of the day nothin is gained

Listen to the voice within. I'll see ya later
Pay heed to the grand oral disseminator..
",Reverence,2008
Jeff Hamilton,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you",Since I Fell for You,2008

And stay awake both day and night

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be (smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, smack dab in the middle, boys now
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Ten suits of clothes to dress to kill

And fifty chicks not over twenty-two

Oh, I wanna be (smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, now boys you can see why
I wanna be smack dab in the middle now

A street that's paved with natural pearls
A wagon load of bonds and stocks
Then open up the door at Fort Knox

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)
I wanna be (smack dab in the middle)
Ahhhhh, now listen boys throw me
Smack dab in the middle right now
So Ray can rock and roll to satisfy his soul

That's all right!

A lot of bread and gangs of meat
Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound

Then throw me (smack dab in the middle)

Ah, throw me now, smack dab in the middle right now

Jeff Hamilton,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon (Inst): Blue Moon,2008

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Jeff Hanna,"It's been ten long years since I left my home
In the hollow where I was born
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
And the foxhunter blows his horn

I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville 
And worked in a sawmill or two

What have they done to the old home place 
Why did they tear it down
And why did I leave the plow in the field
And look for a job in the town

Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away

Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I've lost my love I've lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead",The Old Home Place,2001

It's the same thing every time
And the last thing you will hear
Is the first thing on your mind
Though in telling our lives on and on again
And you try to see the times when it's open
And worry not of regret

Please remember the scenery
It was clear and calm for me
The place just hung with open eyes
And we all knew my machine
Still I'm breathing standing
Trying hard to reply knowing why
The one who sleeps while in motion
Is easily placed as you'll find

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Jeff Harrington,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

When you crossed it
Had your number, baby,
But I lost it
I know your love,
Was just a flimflam

Well, you can't pull the wool over me,
Cause I'm a confidence man

I can talk old ladies,
Out of all of their money
I can talk young girls,
Into calling me honey
You can talk all you want, baby,
But I got fast hands

I know your mother
Taught you how to bake a pie,
And read a book
Your daddy
Taught you how to tell a lie,
And not get shook

Let me tell you somethin', baby
You better learn,
If you're gonna con the con man,
You're liable to get burned

Now, now, now,
We were stretched out on the floor, baby,
It's all elastic
But you stretched it too tight,
And it snapped like plastic,
And the pieces went flying across the badlands.

Well, you can't pull the wool over me,
'cause I'm a confidence man.

Is where you're bound
But love is a cheap perfume,
It hangs around

Jeff Healey,"Well she's got to be a 20 on a scale of 10
Walking on an edge that's razor thin
One in a million from her head to her toes
A hole in her heart as the next man's money goes

She's a cruel little number
Wild little weed
Momma's little princess
Daddy's bad seed

Mind of a maniac
She's breakin' all the rules
Cruel little number
Why do you have to be so cruel?

She ain't tight with the ladies
She don't kiss and tell
She want a black Mercedes
500 S E L

She knows the scent of a dollar
Don't want a check in the mail
She blew the price of love
Right off the end of the scale

She's a cruel little number
Wild little weed
Momma's little princess
Daddy's bad seed

Mind of a maniac
She's breakin' all the rules
Cruel little number
Why do you have to be so cruel?

Her heart can't be broken
'Cause it's stainless steel
You can beg, you can bargain
But she's never gonna cut you a deal

She's a cruel little number

Momma's little princess
Daddy's bad seed

Mind of a maniac
She's breakin' all the rules

Jeff Healey,"The bar was filled with smoke and lies,
I couldn't see a thing, it burned my eyes
I pushed a strange woman off my lap,
She had a snake tattooed on her back

The doors opened into the night,
The silence kissed my worried life
I heard a song comin' from the back,
It played over and over again

[Chorus]
I stood just around the bend, over the hill,
Across the river bed, one step closer to hell
If I forget about my past, forget about my guilt,
I go back to the house that love built, that love built

I went back to the bar again,
And headed straight for the band
I need to remember not to forget,
All the life and the love we had

So play that song and make it right,
Get me out of this lonely night
Slapped all my money into his hand,
Said play it over and over again

And you're feeling good today

For me and you to meet

Have you told your people

Over land and sea 
Yet a moonbeam on the water 
Casts a spell o'er me 
A vision fair I see 
Again I seem to be

Back home again in Indiana, 
And it seems that I can see 
The gleaming candlelight, still burning bright, 
Through the sycamores for me. 
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance 
Through the fields I used to roam. 
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash, 
How I long for my Indiana home.

Fancy paints on memory's canvas 
Scenes that we hold dear 
We recall them in days after 
Clearly they appear 
And often times I see 
A scene that's dear to me

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came

They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears

She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You've had time to think about it for a while

Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won't matter who loves who, you'll love me or I'll love you
When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape

Well, I can't provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie
You'll know all about it, love it'll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I've never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver
I've never asked to set yourself up for a fall

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die
Stick around, baby, we're not through don't look for me, I'll see you
When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don't want to be a fool starving for affection
I don't want to drown in someone else's wine

For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that's howling in your eye
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling, when the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Where my memory is not so short

This time I'm asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you'll give it to me now I'll take it anyhow

When the night comes falling from the sky

Buried three foot deep in mason jars
He forgot more times than not
Where he left it stashed out in the yard

He told us before he died
?Boys, don't do what I did
Save enough to get you by
And go spend all the rest?

It?s only money, that's all it is
Harder to make it than it is to spend
Can't take it with ya, so don't let it get ya
It?s only money, yeah

Tonight?s a California Merlot
May I suggest the calamari
Oysters or the escargot??

And in those blue eyes I got lost

In the window of a jewelry store downtown, oh, no
She said I like the way it sparkles
As she kissed me and I pulled my wallet out, yes, I did

If it makes her happy
I don't care how much they charge
I still got a closet full of grandpa?s mason jars

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels

Trying to get to Holland or France.

You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.

Honeymooning down by the Seine.

Peter Brown called to say,

You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.

Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed,
I said we're only trying to get us some peace.

You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.

Last night the wife said,
Oh boy, when you're dead you 
Don't take nothing with you but your soul think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

She's gone to his head,
They look just like two Gurus in a drag.

You know how hard it can be.

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change

Jeff Kievit,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013
Jeff Kievit,"It's all there in the gospels
The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects 
But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty 
The stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still

""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I cannot be missing, the lads'll expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

And whatever it was that ye've done to be here
It's the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears

Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast

And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
And whatever got said, they'd be counted at least

You see, ""The Queen's took a taxi herself to the station!""
Where the porters, surprised by her lack of Royal baggage,
Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage,
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.
There's a fight over seats, ""I beg pardon Your Grace,
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Aye, but where are they going?"" All the porters debate,
""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide,
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide.""
There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome,
Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home.
There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales,
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails.
""Why, they haven't got tickets,"" ""Come now, it's just a detail,
There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail,
For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail!""

And your knowing glances are mine

Jeff Langley,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?

Thinking he was a trusty tree,

Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

I'm standing 'round my window
You say you're going away
But I believe in love

The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

But while the stars are coming out
And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

And even though you do

Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...

All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend

Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
I can't say any more

'Cause I need you
Yes I want you
Yes I love you 
As I look from my window

To the streets where you stand
I am gazing through dark glass
We can't walk hand in hand
Though your friends try to tell me

Though your friends you defend
They keep my heart from your heart
We must be in the end

Yes I need you

Something to be seen

Playing in the big lights
Trouble came for free

Music was my saviour
Took me to the fast lane
Answered all my needs

Far away from people we know?
We could live our lives together
Happiness wherever we go""
And I will always love her
And I will always care

All the love she'd thrown away as a child
All the things she thought she had seen

Jeff Leach,"I woke up to a feeling, it was cold by my side
You had gone with the sunrise, leaving tears in my eyes
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind 

Well I walked out this morning, down a street with no name
To a club called ""The Loser"", like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription, it's the only one they do 

I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting ""Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!""
Felt a hand on my shoulder, heard a voice cry ""Just in time!""
Felt the quick push, felt the air rush
Felt the sidewalk, fell in line",Suicide,2001

Jeff Lisenby,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Jeff Lisenby,"There's a time each year
That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es

And life is one beautiful rhyme

Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""

When we never thought it a crime

With faces brown as berries

I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

No way to control it, it's totally automatic

Jeff Loomis,"One by one, the fools suck you in
Like many others before
No guilty conscience, just another sin
They're truly rotten to the core

Contracts with criminal intent
Spelling out the things they're gonna do
Liars, taking back their word
Draining the life right out of you

Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade

Paid for the service, signed the dotted line
But then get nothing in return
Result, I'm sinking, running out of time
Response, it's none of my concern

When you're exposed
The first reaction, defend it with another lie
Attempted character assassination
You cannot kill me but you try

Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade, go

Payback is mine
You tried to make a mockery
It's payback time
A failed attempt to bring an end to me

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Two faced, these sad little people
Enjoy the spotlight while you can
Disrespecting, those who you deceive
You're just a flash in the pan

Evil, to take you for a ride
Then try to damage all you've got
Pure scum and headed for a fall
Karma will catch up and then you'll rot

A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York

We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall

Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
I am the fairground man at heart 
I run the roundabout this part 
I fill this fair but custom have I none

I turn the handle round so fast it makes my elbow ache 
Nobody seems to care 
No-one rides upon my roundabout no longer anymore 
Oh what a horrid fair!

Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout 
Climb aboard my roundabout

Money there is none - I'm thinner than a skeleton

But wait a minute, I'm so thin 
That all these aches and pains could be a chance for me 
I could be a horror or a ghost in a ghost train 
I think I'll go and see

I meet the man who runs the ghost train 
He says, ""You're just great! 
I'll pay you top class wages 
If you'll just hang from this gate""

A year is passing lots of food and money come my way 
Oh lucky man am I 
But who's this telling me, ""You're fired! 
You're much too fat to be a ghost, be on your way!"" 
So here I am

Jeff Lynne,"Did you see your friend crying from his eyes today
Did you see him run through the streets and far away
Did you see him run, did you see him fall
Did his life flash by at the bedroom door

Did you hear the news it came across the air today
Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay
Did you see him hide, did you see him crawl
Does his life mean more than it did before

Did you see that man running through the streets today
Did you catch his face, was it 10538

I've seen lovers flying through the air
Hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you.

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
Woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That i've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Her mother would not dare
To let her anywhere
She was a lonely girl

John and paul and ringo and george
Were playing lovely tunes
From the window of her room
By the light of the moon

Hey girl there at the window I wish you would come and see me
Ive got so much to tell you so much I want you to see

In the fields lived a lonely boy
Whod wander every night
Just to see her window light
Then he was happier

Then hed sit upon the ground
Just to listen to the sound
Of the music going round
And he would call to her

Hey girl there at the window I wish you would come and see me
Ive got so much to tell you so much I want you to see

One night her mother said I think its time for bed
The little girl crept down the stairs free as a bird

Hey girl there at the window I wish you would come and see me
Ive got so much to tell you so much I want you to see

She met the boy sitting on the ground
And they listened to the sound

They were happy now

Jeff Lynne,"Down, down, you can see them all
Rising gaily to the top
Keep on rising babe, you know you got a long drop
You better cling 'cos it's the done thing

Down, down at the Policeman's ball
They're all dancing in a line
Keep on gruntin' boys, you know you're doin' fine
Come quickly, I've been strangled

Down, down at the Military, yeah
They're all marching round and round, oh
Keep them boots shined and that stiff upper lip down, yeah
Ablution revolution

Down, down at the launching pad
Giant phallus stands erect
Ten thousand tons of waste throb then eject
Look out space, we're gonna change our place

Down, down in old England town
There was air and now there's smoke
Let's build more cars and drive away before we choke
Suddenly it's always night time

Down, down at that nice Trade Fair
All the money gone astray
Let's inflate this price and float away
Just you and me and everyone

Jeff Lynne,"Played too hard and he died too young
To be certain of earning his burnt out love
He won a place in history
And his name will live eternally

Lived the life of a movie star
And he waved to the people from a big black car
Down in a book with the greatest names
As a lonely maid cried, ""Take the pain""

Tell me a story, mister
There ain't no time left to lose

Ten man tried in the dead of night
But the great man's final words to right
In a room that was soft and red
The great man spoke outside my head

Tell me a story, mister
There ain't no time left to lose

So glad of your company, your morning music,
My wife she ran away, she left our home,
And though you're here with me, I'm on my own.

Hello, Mr. Radio, you friendly speaker,
You played my request today, request to see her
Your voice comes riding home across the air,
You travel 'round the world, but still you're here.

I heard on the news today the world is no good,
But if she returns today mine could be so good
I look into the sky, your waves rush by,
The weather man has lied, it makes me cry.

Hello, Mr. Radio, do I disturb you?
Sometimes I forget my place, I seem to know you
I miss you when you close, you'll never know,
And when your programs go, I'm on my own.",Mr. Radio,1971
Jeff Lynne,"Saw the folks down below crying
Heard them on the radio lying
Distant bells in the air ringing out, do they hear?
Do they know it's growing very near?

Everybody sitting here
They don't realize
They've got no time

Saw the transmitter sway slowly
Saw it crash in the lane coldly
Saw the sea rushing into the coast now they've seen
Now they know it's growing very near

Everybody sitting here
They don't realize
They've got no time

Saw them gather in slow motion
Setting sail on the tired ocean
Heard the clouds rolling by, shouting down from the sky
Hear them speak their last goodbye

Everybody sitting here
They don't realize
They've got no time
No time

Waiting for the wind, 
To blow away the veil of time 
Slowly now the threads of age

Are starting to unwind
Queen of the hours, 
Along, along, along the path of time, of time 
She is still, the clock shall tell, 
The tale when all is well, is well

Black was the night that 
Came in from the east 
And caused the land to sleep 
Riding on a storm it carved 
A message in the Isabella Creek.

Dawn is the death wish 
Night has passed away 
It left a sacred flower 
Open up the grave and bowed it´s life 
Unto the Queen of the hours.",Queen of the Hours,1971

My heart's beating a rhythm, singing out rhythm & blues

Go get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up now

Do you remember when life was just a new day?

You know the story, don't you?

Sitting here upon the Milky Way
Ahh, look at the dancing girls
Sitting, holding hands across the world

You got a brand new lady
Just like the one you left down in some other place
Reading all the letters
Saw your face coming through on the Ouija board

Ahh, look at the dancing girls
Sitting, holding hands across the world

Jeff Lynne,"I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell
Maybe you'd understand

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it?s turning
While my guitar gently weeps
From every mistake we must surely be learning
And still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei.
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why.

Nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles

Things can go bump, in the dead of the night

Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay

We played our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy
That swept that afternoon
To paint that love
Upon a white balloon

And fly it from
The top-est top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something
Just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes
And saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard
But the Captain shook his head

And away they soared
Climbing through
The ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party
The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party

The sun machine is coming down
And we're gonna have a party

And we're gonna have a party

I am so awfully misunderstood

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to

I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known

Jeff Parker,"You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean
if you think back about what you really said, what it's all about, honor, loving and
obeying till death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should it
should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what
you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the fights we had?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take $1 million to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how I tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scared the life, my name
But I can't understand, 'cause if you love me
How could you turn me into nothin' least
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so inviting and your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, after lasting for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years and break away to the blue-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend: I'll never be back again
But we're not really bitter babe
I promise you all the love in the world, good love in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied just to have me by your side
Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave, you're mine
God judged me on His side; you've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Of love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'd love to get in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day when you'd put me through what you put me 
through
You try your best, you say I gave you no rest

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Jeff Peterson,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And took a walk down through the park

On some solitary rock

The heart makes very clear

Into a chamber reserved for the Queen

Opened it slowly and started to read

Give it to the pawn who came, she cried

And this is what she told the gathered round

Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color

When the magic would spin

2:00 PM: I missed my class again 
Did you miss yours too because you’re sleeping in? 
Are the two of us both imagining seven-hour round-trips into each others’ beds? 
And everything so unexpectedly started to change in the dreams 
But I was preoccupied with how the magic would end 
Because nothing intangible remains sustainable 
Hope is a scheme
Will I ever see you again?
Will I ever see you again?
And if I see you soon will you want to see me? 
Or will you just want to sneak away? Did I creep you out like a scary movie? 
I hope that we feel the same, I hope that we feel the same

I made out in the van with a girl I like 
We were kinda drunk, but it seemed alright

If there’s someone thinking of you, when you’re feeling alone when you’re feeling alone

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

While the prairie is blooming I fear for my time

Hold my hand, little loved one, and listen to me

My dreams were like diamonds, I’d hold them and run
But treasures on earth are empty and cold
Your fortune will find you in the worth of your soul

When I get to Heaven all the angels will sing
And there I will dwell in the mansions of kings

They buried my mother ten years ago
Spring on the wind covered prairie the morning dove sings
I wander this earth and fear not my home
In the stillness of evening I hear her song

Jeff Taylor,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999

As the evening sky grew dark

Tingle to his bones

As she was walkin' on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.

Who lived and suffered in this world below
But they've gone off to heaven, but I want to know
What are they doing there now?

Oh, what are they doing in heaven today,
Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say.
But what are they doing there now?

There's some whose hearts
Were burdened with care
They paid for their moment with fighting and tears
But they clung to the cross trembling in fear

Where sin and sorrow are all done away?

Where sin and sorrow are all done away?

Jeff Wayne,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century 
That human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space 
No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinized
As someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets 
And yet, across the gulf of space
Minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes
And slowly and surely
They drew their plans against us

At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way

And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it
A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilvy came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape 
He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him
Before he could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said

Are a million to one, but still, they come

It seems totally incredible to me now that

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,

Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. 
The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Journalist
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, 
More and more people joined the painful exodus. 
Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, 
Their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. 

Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, 
And here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, 
Cutting through bridges as though they were paper. 
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, 
Had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. 
This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, 
Without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. 

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. 
I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. 
At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. 
At that very moment, it was raised, 
And I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Jeff Wayne,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!",The Artilleryman and the Fighting Machine,1981
Jeff Wayne,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Jeff Wayne,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London,1981

Jeff Wayne,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century 
That human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space 
No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinized
As someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets 
And yet, across the gulf of space
Minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes
And slowly and surely
They drew their plans against us

At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way

And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it
A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilvy came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape 
He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him
Before he could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

It seems totally incredible to me now that
Everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other
From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains
Ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance

It all seemed so safe and tranquil",Eve of the War,1981
Jeff Wayne,"It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.
Next morning a crowd gathered on the common, hypnotized by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous, disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated.
A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly heat.
People clawed their way off the common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep.
I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life, working eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight would sweep the common, and the heat ray was ready to follow.
In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the common to form a cordon.
That evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror that my home was within reach of the heat ray.
At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.",Horsell Common and the Heat Ray,1981

","Red Weed, Pt. 2",1981
Jeff Wayne,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,1981
Jeff Wayne,"There were ships of shapes and sizes
Scatter out along the bay
And I thought I heard her calling
As the steamer pulled away
The Invaders must have seen them
As across the coast they filed
Standing firm between them
There lay Thunder Child

Moving swiftly through the waters
Cannons blazing as she came
Brought a might metal war-lord
Crashing down in sheets of flame

Sensing victory was nearing
Thinking fortune must have smiled
People started cheering
""Come on Thunder Child""
""Come on Thunder Child""

The Martians released their black smoke, but the ship sped on, 
Cutting down one of the tripod figures 
Instantly, the others raised their Heat Rays 
And melted the Thunder Child's valiant heart

Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing Heat Rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliverance
As we watched the sinking wreck
With the smoke of battle clearing
Over graves in waves defiled
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child! [Repeat x 2]

When the smoke had cleared, the little steamer had reached the misty horizon, 
And Carrie was safe
But the Thunder Child had vanished forever, 
Taking with her man's last hope of victory
The leaden sky was lit by green flashes, cylinder following cylinder, 
And no one and nothing was left now to fight them
The Earth belong to the Martians.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,

Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper. Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way

And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it
A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilvy came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape 
He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him
Before he could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said 
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

It seems totally incredible to me now that
Everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other
From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains
Ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance

It all seemed so safe and tranquil",The Eve of the War [From Jeff Wayne's the War of the Worlds],1991
Jeff Wayne,"The summer sun is fading as the year grows old
And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn

Way back up in the pines
It's where I hold the sweetest memories
In the hills of Caroline

My daddy wasn't much of nothin'
Spent his life doin' time
But mama learned me about Jesus
In the hills of Caroline

I met a girl her name was Hattie
Fair and tender, sweet and kind
She showed me how to love a woman
In the hills of Caroline

I always thought that we would marry
One sweet day she would be mine
But Hattie's gone, to live with Jesus
In the hills of Caroline

Let my heart feel love again
Let her in

Jeff White,"I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through

I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

And others who broke my heart they were like northern stars

Jeff Wood,"I was eight years old, we were poor as dirt
Mom was pregnant with my sister and dad was out of work
I wanted a bicycle to ride with my friends
A shiny western flyer in candy-apple red
I couldn't understand why that bike never came
But money can't buy what I got in its place
Dad tied wooden blocks to the pedals of his Schwinn
Rolled out that clunker and said with a grin

Use mine, go ahead take it, what else is it for
I wish I could do more, just go slow
You're gonna do fine, this is what life's all about
Use mine

Senior prom, I was scared to death
But I finally called up Julianne and she said, yes
On top of the world when the big night arrived
Till suddenly it dawned on me what I had to drive
My rusty blue Dodge had one orange door
Rips in the seats and a hole in the floor
I looked at my dad and his new Mercury
And I couldn't believe it when he tossed me the key and said

Use mine, go ahead take it, what else is it for
I wish I could do more, just go slow
You're gonna do fine, this is what life's all about
Use mine

Now I'm sittin' here starin' at my old man
The doctors don't give him much time
He's tryin' to stand up but his strength is all gone
So I say to my hero as I offer my arm

Use mine, go ahead take it, what else is it for
I wish I could do more, just go slow

no matter what I might say;
The days are made with waterfall colors,
Couldn't I make you stay?
If rain falls down the side of my face,

must be a rainy day;
But I get lost in yesterday,
And tomorrow, tomorrow;
Young girl Sunday blues,
And all her sorrow.

and I'm high;
I walk beside you laughing,
When I tell you I dream,
Don't try to touch me with words;
It might seem like silence,
But so much can be heard;
I think of things,

that loving you brings,
Maybe my thing is her;
Today is made up of yesterday,
And tomorrow;
Young girl Sunday blues,
And all her sorrow;
Let yourself wander free and easy

Ah, come into my mind,
Ah, come into my life,

Young and new girl,
You're the only true girl,
Here can please me,

Please me!
Please me!

Disappear without a trace
And someone else will take your place
In line

You can fool your friends about the way it ends
But you can't fool yourself
Take your head in hand and make your own demands
Or you'll crystallize on the shelf

Need somebody to love, wouldn't you
Love somebody to love, you better
Find somebody to love

Tears are running down and down and down your breast
And your friends, baby   they treat you like a guest
Don't you want somebody to love, don't you
Need somebody to love, wouldn't you
Love somebody to love, you better
Find somebody to love",Somebody to Love,1987
Jefferson Airplane,"Sometimes I feel like I am leaving life behind
My hands are moving faster than the movement of my mind
Thoughts and generations of my dreams are yet unborn
I hope that I will find them 'fore my moving gets too worn
If only I could live to see the dawning of the dawn

So we go on moving trying to make this image real
Straining every nerve not knowing what we really feel
Straining every nerve ending and everybody sees
That what they read in the Rolling Stone has really come to be
And trying to avoid a taste of that reality

On an early New York mornin' a mirror in the hall
Showed to me a face I didn't know at all
Lines were drawn around a pair of eyes that opened wide
When I looked into the mouth there was nothing left inside

So I walked into the little room and whistled like a sigh
As dawn light closed around me now my head was still in gear
Thinking thoughts of playing more and singing loud and clear
Trying to reach a friend somewhere and make that person smile
Maybe pull myself away from that old lonesome mile

That often comes to haunt me in the morning
All my friends keep telling me that it would be a shame
To break up such a grand success and tear apart a name
But all I know is what I feel whenever I'm not playin'
Emptiness ain't where it's at and neither's feeling pain

Well now what is going to happen now is anybody's guess
If I can't spend my time with love I guess I need a rest
Time is getting late now and the sun is getting low
My body's getting tired of carryin' another's load
And sunshine's waiting for me a little further down the road",Third Week in the Chelsea,1987
Jefferson Airplane,"I just look at you
And I'm hypnotized
Like I'm drowning now
Drowning in your eyes

Past imagining
And I want you more
More than anything

And I cannot speak
And I've lost my sight
All my senses gone
Lost in you tonight
And I want your love
Be my lady be my lady

Do I ask too much
Do I want too much
Want to know you now
Want to feel your touch
You just look at me
Feel the fire start
Want to make you burn
Want to touch your heart

[Chorus]

Got a racing heart
And my minds a roar
Never felt like this
Never loved before
And it's dangerous

Burn to ashes now

I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep in the

And you can count on me girl
You can count on my love

You can count on me baby
You can count on my love to see
You through

Caught in the wheel and lost in
The feel of a love so soon

Then I pluck your body like a string (show you what I mean)
Then I start dancing inside you (oh baby, a love song)

Though your master's head's blown off you got to go with it
Roll with the natural flow
Like water off a spinning ball
Out - the one remaining way to go
Free - the only way to fall
The light in the night is the sun
And it can carry you around the planetary ground
And the planetary whip of the sun
Will carry you well past Gideon
And the people you see will leave you be
More than the ones you've known before
Hey - rollin' on

We are wanderers
Are you anymore?

And you gotta let go you know
You gotta let go you know
You gotta let go you know

Careful where you tread 
Underfoot are the visions lost 
Sleeping not yet dead 

Hang on winds starting to howl 
Hang on the beast is on the prowl 
Hang on can you hear the 
Strange cry 
Winds of change are blowing by 

Mountains crumble and cities fall 
Don't come to an end 
Just lie scattered on the 
Desert floor 
Waiting for the wind 

You got your life planned carefully 
But you left out one detail 
The hidden hand deals just one round 
And the winds of change prevail 

Walk softly through the desert sand 
Old dreams lead the way 
Nothing new in the sands of time 
Just changes every day

Hang on there's no shelter from 
The wind 
Hang on like a fire from the sky

I can see the Paris lights
And the warm Italian nights
Seems like Summertime just flies
Through so many skies we've flown
So many lands we've come to know
And we watch our love just grow
'Til the Winter brings us home
No time gives us reasons for why it just goes by
And no man can stop the seasons
But so many men will try

We will travel these ancient lands
And our minds will learn to fly
We will hear all the music of man
Learn to love before we die

In these lands ruled by kings
The enchanted princess sings
And all the fairy tales she knew
The sweet lies we thought were true
But the castles on the Rhein
Never seem to mind the time
That will take them slowly back
Into history's memorized lines
Wooden shoes and tulips in Holland
English guards with medieval swords
Conquistadors and Spanish galleons
Vikings sailing the mountain fjords

We will travel these ancient lands
And our minds will learn to fly
We will hear all the music of man
Learn to love before we die

How to play this game?

They say everything's fine
No one will hear them complain
But behind those smiles, so much purple rain
It's a wonder anybody ever comes out sane, but they do

When you're by yourself you get that silent noise
Inside your mind, all the party boys trying to fill up
All the empty holes don't let one be her soul

Freedom, or does it really mean you're just all alone
Freedom, either way it's gonna take you home
It just takes you by the hand and says,
Now it's time to grow

So my friend you're gonna be alright

But then that's the only way to get high

No matter how hard you try
Oh Panda Bear, my gentle friend
I don't want to say goodbye

He was sold to a man whose money has no pride
Shining fur traded for gold, but the price is too high
His kind is almost gone, he wants to survive

Where the sun brings the morning to the sky
If we will try to share that morning light
We will find that we all have the right to life

I've got to know what you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin' babe it feels so good whatever it is

Whatever it is and whatever it's called
I know that it's you, I can't help getting involved
With your love

Baby, sweet baby
Take it away

With your love
With your love
With your love

Whatever you did to me, well you sure did it good
My heart's filled with lovin' and I knew that it would
With your love

Don't know what's happened to me since I met you
I feel like I'm fallen in love since I met you

I've got to know what you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin' babe it feels so good whatever it is

Knew from the start it had to be you
You got my heart I don't know what I'm gonna do
With your love
Baby sweet baby
",With Your Love,2002
