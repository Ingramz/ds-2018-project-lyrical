Butta un BTP sull'Lp col beat

Negli slip ho un MIG
Col cheque to cheque

Come Bill qui si investe in bit
Punto sul .com e sul .it
Un tris di titoli e faccio il vip
Con un trip chic a shar, el sheik

Luces brillan no hay descanso

Esta noche oye, no es cualquier noche

L'elettricità eccita tutte le luci da città a città
Per una lucciola c'è chi riduce la velocità chissà
Che escogita mha! C'è chi vomita l'anima in un bar
Che si illumina come un coshar

Che ha trovato una cicca di Pall Mall
E se l'accende davanti ad una banca
Fari di una macchina che sosta in fondo
Quanto costa un condom?

Quanto costa il mondo
Sotto gli spot puntati sui viaggi in Congo?
Quanto costa un sogno?
Nulla sulla panchina che mi culla come nel vientre
Di una bolla che valla mentre vado su!

Sácate la careta y ve, ve, vente paca
Que esta noche chico no hay excusa
De roncones saldrán ritmos que fusionan
Mentalidades in a one connection

Vayan donde vayan
Vengan de donde vengan
Lo que nos unió no nos lo quitarán

Di tutti questi libri sulla musica
Di tutte le interviste, di tutte le riviste
Di tutti gli arrivisti, gli arrivisti, gli arrivisti

Io con la musica non c'entro niente
Come il mio pene davanti al WC, a luci spente (ha ha ha ha ha)
Mi contraddico facilmente
Ma lo faccio così spesso che questo fa di me una persona coerente
Ed ho tanto da dire perché ho poco da fare
Tu mi invidi, sorridi, mi proponi un affare
Cominciare con i temi di cui parla Faber
E finire per un mese sull'isola a far la fame (bu)
Qualsiasi cosa faccia mi viene riconosciuta?
No, è la mia faccia che viene riconosciuta (ha ha ha ha ha)
Molti dei miei fan che fanno la schiuma
Hanno la doppia faccia come il Barone Ashura (bu)
Parlano con me come con un fratello grande
E mi riprendono in mutande come nel Grande Fratello (ha ha ha ha ha)
Il video che mi fanno mentre lecco un orinale
È cliccato più del video ufficiale della mia label

E chi se ne frega della musica
Di tutti questi libri sulla musica
Di tutte le interviste, di tutte le riviste
Di tutti gli arrivisti, gli arrivisti, gli arrivisti
Sì ma chi se ne frega della musica
Ora che tutti parlano di musica
Di tutti questi artisti, di tutti questi dischi
Di tutti questi fischi, questi fischi, questi fischi

Non ho mai capito questi social network
Per me servono solo a fare i porci a letto (ha ha ha ha ha)
Ogni volta che nasce una nuova piattaforma
Mi fa l'effetto di un libro che ho già letto (bu)
E poi non ho tutti 'sti amici ma molti meno
Mi danno affetto ma poi m'affettano come Ghemon
Tu è due ore che mi parli, io sono fan di Gandhi
Ed è solo per questo che non ti meno (ha ha ha ha ha)
Il mio cellulare squilla ogni due minuti
Gente che mi assilla e mi chiede se ho due minuti
Assessori, collettivi, sindacati, giornalisti
Passa un giorno e i miei testicoli non sono più minuti (ha ha ha ha ha)
Mi stupisco, pubblico un disco
E mi fanno le foto in pubblico. Perché? Non capisco (bu)
Oh, non vi interessano le note che registro
Vi interessano le mie note sul registro

E chi se ne frega della musica
Di tutti questi libri sulla musica
Di tutte le interviste, di tutte le riviste
Di tutti gli arrivisti, gli arrivisti, gli arrivisti
Sì ma chi se ne frega della musica
Ora che tutti parlano di musica
Di tutti questi artisti, di tutti questi dischi
Di tutti questi fischi, questi fischi, questi fischi

Io non faccio musica ma il cacchio che mi pare
Faccio rosicare chi ama il genere musicale
Non parlo male di un collega o di un presunto tale
Ma riciclo il suo CD come regalo di Natale (ha ha ha ha ha) 
Non mi faccio i flash come Syd Barret
Non mi piacciono i flash sul red carpet (bu)
E me ne frego degli artisti veri
Tanto gli artisti veri sono veri come i Muppet (ha ha ha ha ha)
In questo meccanismo che non posso inceppare
La rete non è Che Guevara, anche se si finge tale
Al primo posto nella classifica digitale
Che tu ci creda o meno c'è solo chi vince i talent (bu)
Ed io non so cantare, già, ma soprattutto
Non so piangere in pubblico per bucare lo schermo (ha ha ha ha ha)
Toglimi tutto questo che magari mi fermo
Di certo non mi freddo in una stanza d'albergo (bu)

Di tutti i mercenari della musica
In queste trasmissioni sulla musica
Di tutti questi artisti
Della Pizzi, di Battisti
Di Zanicchi, di Stravinskij

Dei Beastie, degli Extreme
Dei Lipps Inc., di Springsteen

Abbiamo un nuovo concorrente stasera e direi di iniziare subito con le domande

Domanda d'ecologia
Via quel sorriso da Krusty il Clown
Dammi solo la risposta più drastica
Sulla differenza tra bottiglie di plastica in acqua
Ed acqua nelle bottiglie di plastica

Sport
Campioni del mondo 2006 e l'anno dopo mondiali di pallavolo
Nazionale sul podio, perché non si fa festa
Perché se ne parla così poco?

Cultura
Gomorra best-seller
Si moltiplica come un porno sul server
A che serve dire che fa affari se ti fai gli affari tuoi da sempre?
Dici che devo andare a lavorare (soldi facili, devi andare a lavorare)
Ma come? Giochi le lotterie per fare grana dal nulla
E mi fai proprio tu la morale?

Ci sono cose che non capisco e a cui nessuno dà la minima importanza
E quando faccio una domanda
Mi rispondono con frasi di circostanza tipo
""Tu ti fai troppi problemi, Michele""
""Tu ti fai troppi problemi, Michele""
""Tu ti fai troppi problemi, Michele""
""Tu, ti fai troppi problemi, non te ne fare più""

Quesito di politica
Da un'indagine
Si parla meno di Stato più della sua immagine
Ma che diamine
Passare da Italia ad Italia 1 è davvero così facile?

Storia
Risorgimento italiano
Non fare il baro o chiamo il notaro
Perché non dirlo, il tema dell'inno
Non è di Mameli è di Novaro

News
Ore tredici a tavola
Riuniti davanti al TG come ellenici all'agorà
Notizie del principe di Corona
Di Draghi e del Cavaliere
Cos'è? Una favola?
E i funerali di stato a che servono?
I militari in missione a chi servono?
E i caduti sul lavoro? Per loro nemmeno un cero con il santo patrono
Ma sii serio

Si concentri, ha poco tempo a disposizione
Le ricordo che se la Sua azienda sta fallendo può chiedere l'aiuto del denaro pubblico
Mi dispiace, ha perso, arrivederci

Una nuova pletora di uomini pecora
Con i lupi se ne va senza remora
Priva di identità, omini di Legoland la cui regola
È obbedire come un vero clan
Pastori cani mi guidano tra le tappe
Temono il dito di Galileo tra le chiappe
Vogliono menti barricate, quali grappe
E non le mettono al corrente come l'ampere
Devo superare le mie diffidenze
Via museo della scienza di Firenze, spranghe
Pezze annodate come pretzel
Sono Inside Man come Denzel
Colpo del secolo, di colpo trasecolo
Ho rubato il dito, sei pronto per l'esodo?
Sarai libero, mai più Medioevo col 
Dito medio di Galileo nel didietro

Portiamo il dito medio di Galileo
Portiamolo alla testa del corteo
Nessuno sarà più chiamato babbeo 
Se lo infilerà nei pressi del perineo
(Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo)

Il dito di Galileo assalito nel corteo
Diventato mito per alcuni come Clooney George
Giù tutti a pecora con i culi nell'apogeo
Abbassano i pantaloni, sollevano il pareo
Non fa sosta la supposta pop star
Gente genuflessa dalla parte opposta
Lo sbatte e basta non batte cassa
Come con una salma esposta
La verità brucia come candeggina
Ma vedi qua, noi c'abbiamo vaselina
Bagna le dita e chinati, si si
Prima di rimanere fuori da prenotazioni in agendina
Una falange là ti fa la crosta, già
Qualcuno ti dirà che sei apostata, ma
Prendi lo sapere nello sfintere
È meglio dell'esame della prostata

Portiamo il dito medio di Galileo
Portiamo il dito medio di Galileo
Portiamolo alla testa del corteo

Nessuno sarà più chiamato babbeo 
Se lo infilerà nei pressi del perineo

Galileo chi si oppose al tuo genio
Fu più vil del coyote nel canyon
Se la chiesa ti ha messo all'indice
Beh, che male c'è tu la metti al medio
Le tue pecore si fanno umane
Chi se ne frega se si fanno male
Vedi quanti culi puoi penetrare
Tu che prima li vedevi con il cannocchiale
La cul-tura parrocchiale ha vedute corte ma tu vai forte 
Fai passi da gigante oltre Coltrane
Sveli segreti più di Brokeback Mountain
E non si dica che non hai mosso un dito
Altro che dito è dinamite
Tu vivrai Galileo come quel Galileo messo in croce prima di te (prima di te, prima di te, prima di te)

Le accuse contro Galileo erano molteplici (prima di te, prima di te, prima di te)
Leggeva, teneva in casa e leggeva libri proibiti (prima di te, prima di te, prima di te)
Galileo negli ultimi diciotto mesi non è mai andato a messa
Galileo convive con una donna
Ma soprattutto Galileo fa gli oroscopi a pagamento
Leggeva, teneva in casa e leggeva libri proibiti (leggeva, teneva in casa e leggeva i libri proibiti, leggeva, teneva in casa e leggeva libri proibiti)
Galileo convive con una donna (Galileo convive con una donna, Galileo convive con una donna)
Galileo negli ultimi diciotto mesi non è mai andato a messa (Galileo negli ultimi diciotto mesi non è mai andato a messa, Galileo negli ultimi diciotto mesi non è mai andato a messa)

E non si è mai confessato (e non si è mai confessato, e non si è mai confessato)
Galileo leggeva libri proibiti

Neanche una farfalla
Sei tu che tratti Gaia come una recluta a naja
Ami il petrolio ma la baia non è una caldaia
La tua mannaia lima l'aria mica l'Himalaia
Gaia si salverà, chi salverà il soldato Ryan?

Non i marziani ma te dovrò respingere e vedrai

Caparezza,"Appena nato Giove m'ha regalato una biglia zaffiro
Mi disse ""abbine cura, è una figlia che t'affido""
L'ho tenuta sul mio cuscino fino al mattino
Ed ero pronto a tutto, perfino al martirio
Da bambino era un pallino che portavo in classe
Sperando che il prof di latino non me lo bocciasse
Cresceva d'anno in anno, stava diventando grande
Prima palla da calcio, poi palla da basket
Divenne un globo che ruotavo in senso orario
Più che un uomo sembravo uno stercorario
Fui costretto a reggerlo come uno zaino
Per il peso ho ancora gli occhi fuori, sembro Igor
Ero felice, di tenere su quel mondo con le rive
Superuomo come Nietzsche
Poi venne di colpo uno scossone nelle nostre vite
Aveva il corpo di Giunone ma il suo nome è Dike

Del giorno in cui mi cadde il mondo addosso
Ricordo tutto pure l'ora e il posto
Il contraccolpo poi la stretta al collo
La stretta al collo, la stretta al collo

Del giorno in cui mi cadde il mondo addosso
Ricordo tutto pure l'ora e il posto
Il contraccolpo poi la stretta al collo
La stretta al collo, la stretta al collo

Dike, una dea per molti, un'angoscia per gli empi
Una benda sugli occhi che annoda coi lembi
Dal pianeta le raccolsi una rosa dei venti
Immaginavo i nostri volti da coppia nei lenti
Lei era la giustizia che non si concede
Io quello che la corteggia, che sta lì, non cede
Ero invaghito, miele, e capivo bene
Che non ci sarei uscito a bere dell'idromele
""Ciao, mi chiamo Atlas""
Petto gonfio, anfora
""Lascio ogni ragazza, con questo mio corpo, afona
E tu, sarai mia, ti voglio addosso, canfora
Posso darti il mondo, il mondo, non la metafora!""
Disse ""non sono di nessuno, nemmeno di Ulisse
E sono chiara e ferma come le stelle più fisse
Usi la forza e la ricchezza per le tue conquiste?
Non sei più forte né più ricco, sei solo più triste!""

Del giorno in cui mi cadde il mondo addosso
Ricordo tutto pure l'ora e il posto
Il contraccolpo poi la stretta al collo
La stretta al collo, la stretta al collo

Del giorno in cui mi cadde il mondo addosso
Ricordo tutto pure l'ora e il posto
Il contraccolpo poi la stretta al collo
La stretta al collo, la stretta al collo

Quindi rifiuti lo scambio di fedi?
Quasi mi insulti mostrandomi i medi?
Alza la fascia, guarda in faccia e venerami, Lady
Per la mia stazza credi non abbia Venere ai miei piedi?
E lei ""Arretra adesso, barbaro!
Che tu sieda sul trono o sulla pietra dello scandalo
A me interessa poco il tuo pianeta bello e vandalo
Piuttosto mi dò fuoco, sto più lieta dentro il Tartaro!""
E da quel punto sono io che non ci ho visto più

(L'ha stretta al collo, l'ha stretta al collo, l'ha stretta al collo)

Io che cado, dal mondo schiacciato mentre la rincorro
Atlante e Dike, Amore e Psiche, terra e giustizia
Fine della storia, fine del rapporto

I tui maglioni slabbrati, pacchiani, ben poco seri
Sei nato nel Mezzogiorno però purtroppo vedi
Solo neve e freddo tutt'intorno come un uomo Yeti

Le tue bottiglie non hanno messaggi
Chi dice che il mondo è meraviglioso
Non ha visto quello che ti stai creando per restarci

A capofitto nel tuo limbo, in preda ai pensieri
Procedi nel tuo labirinto senza pareti

Caronte, diritto verso l'inferno
Lunghe corse, unghie morse, lune storte
Qualche notte svanita in un sonno incerto
Poi l'incendio
Potessi apparirti come uno spettro lo farei adesso
Ma ti spaventerei perché sarei lo spettro di me stesso
E mi diresti: ""Guarda, tutto apposto

Non aver paura di invecchiare
L'età che si dimostra attrae, vedi Persepoli
Non avere paura di stonare
Non le popstar, le campane suonano per secoli
In un mondo in cui tutti competono

Non venerare la modernità, è di plastica
Negli anni '30 la modernità era la svastica
Qui c'è tensione, non si respira, s'ansima
È una crociera estiva ma nella stiva di un Admiral
Viaggia in macchina, monociclo ed aliante
Non nella tua stanza con il dito sull'atlante
Anime penano perché non vanno mai da nessuna parte
E poi quando potrebbero, nessuna parte

A sera spegni il telefonino
È un apparecchio, infatti ti sta togliendo il sorriso
Rispetta la massa, ma quella del tuo corpo
Non quella che dà la colpa ai politici ed è uno schifo
Accettare il dolore per apprezzare la vita
Come ingoiare un tizzone per apprezzare la pizza
Ridicolo, pensare a chi sta peggio non ti fa stare meglio
A meno che tu non sia cinico

Perdi colpi, va così

Ricorda: il tuo sesto senso è quello di colpa
E tutti ne approfittano almeno una volta
Perciò va bene l'apertura verso gli altri
Ma all'entrata mettici almeno una porta
Difenditi e difendi la cultura, non scendendo in piazza
Ma scendendo in piazza per andare al cinema o a teatro
Che quando hanno chiuso l'Odeon tutti protestavano
Già, e in un anno nessuno che c'era andato
Non è vero che è inutile il tuo diploma
È inutile discutere di glutei nel perizoma
Non tutti ti amano, diffidano dell'icona
Diventa santo e sarai di mira come Nicola
Ascolta ciò che ti piace non ciò che piace, che piaccia
Dimentica il Karma, chiunque l'ha fatta franca
Se ti fanno sindaco ringrazia, inaugura piazza, kiss

Non sono più lo stesso di un secondo fa
Nel mio caso, fidati, pure un secondo fa
Al mattino la mia voce roca brontola
Dice ""mettici una croce sopra"", Golgota

And if you call my name
I don’t recognize it
If I look at my face
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it

Ma quale tribuno del popolo
Mi viene sonno dormo più a lungo di Totoro
Fuori salta tutto in aria con le molotov
Mentre sul divano accorcio il divario con Oblomov
Annoiarmi come fanno gli altri in fondo è meglio
Passo gli anni come Mastroianni in ""8 e 1/2""
Scrivo, va bene
Rileggo, non va bene, esco
Vita breve, tipo ""di Adele"" senza le scene lesbo
Attaccato alla penna come la stampa al cronista
Le parole crociate come santa conquista
Da stacanovista a ""staccanovista"" perché stacco spesso
E quando scrivo un pezzo qua stappano Crystal
Tanto per quanta fama ricevi
Avrà sempre più paganti la fontana di Trevi
Non ha senso recitare la parte degli incompresi
Con tutti dalla mia parte, con tutti così cortesi

And if you call my name
I don’t recognize it
If I look at my face
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it
I don’t recognize it

Non mi riconosco più, prosopagnosia
Sto cantando ma il mio volto non è divertito
Quasi non capisco più quale brano sia
Ogni volta mi riascolto e sono risentito
Un video di chirurgia ricorda a me stesso
Che può essere sgradevole guardarsi dentro
Fino a diventare oggetto del proprio disprezzo
E dire ""Sono io sputato quello nello specchio!""
E non aspetto altro (e non aspetto altro)
Che avere un altro aspetto
A sorpresa vengono fuori come un terno secco
Bollori che tengo dentro come un termos, ecco
Si tratta ancora di me ma non è lo stesso
Di riposo non ce n'è, qua non è l'ostello
Faccio un ulteriore passo, non dello Stelvio
Via da questo umore basso, livello sterco

Caparezza,"Questa carriera m'ha già reso re ma senza bandiera
La banda tira l'acqua al suo mulino, sembra Banderas
Tutti mi vogliono risolutivo, ed è una tragedia
Perché io sono come un ladro a Brico, frega una sega
Freddo il mio corpo, voce che strilla, mi sento in galera
Metto il mio volto sulla mia spilla, ""Free Nelson Mandela""
Io vedo me come ammutolito, sepolto, in catena
Se fossi re sarei Ludovico II in Baviera

Come lui me ne sto tra il castello in ciabatte
A sentire il bordello che fa Richard Wagner
Se mi dicono il popolo intero c'ha fame
Rispondo, ""Mi spiace, perlomeno c'ha l'arte""

Vai via, Eins Zwei Drei Vier

Sulle pareti quadri con i miei ritratti sovrani
I consiglieri bravi solo coi ricatti morali
Mi mettono parole in bocca come impianti molari
Ripetono la filastrocca come Gianni Rodari
Ognuno ha smania di comando, punta al piano alto
E si allena con il bracco, ""Cuccia! Bravo, Argo!""
Pur di essere incensato brucia palo santo
Io ci apro le lampo col tuo anello, caro Sauron!

Tutti scalpitano come stare all'ippodromo
Io non voglio il mantello ma un abito comodo
No che non mi ci vedo nel ruolo di Commodo
Spero sia l'""ultima"" come quel gioco di ruolo del Commodore
Quanti esseri umani su sto crocevia?
Vorrebbero dire, ""Ragà, su le mani!"" con la voce mia
(""Ragà, su le mani!"")

Ma lo trapassano come un foglietto, comanda della pizzeria

Io mi comporto come il Papa, al comando dico
""La Chiesa andrebbe cambiata"", come il Papa fosse un altro
Hai capito?
Boicotto la cerimonia, rinuncio al rito
Conquisterò la Polonia con un sorriso
Poco adatto a governare come Ludwig Der Zweite
Non mi cambierai nemmeno a pugni e testate
Ho il pane sul tavolo per le scuri e le spade
Rouhani, col cavolo copro i nudi alle statue
Non ho ambizioni da sire, non sono ostile
Da piccolo non facevo il gradasso sulle giostrine
E quando ho voglia di guardare le stelle alzo gli occhi al cielo
Non li abbasso sulle mostrine",Sogno Di Potere,2017

Un inno di generazione, profumo di spirito giovane

Nel buio di una galera dalle barre chiuse 
Non immaginiamo la catena ma le piume
Passano le guardie tra file di facce mute
Ci mordiamo lingue come capesante crude
Scordati qui, sullo scaffale di un porta CD, che delusione
La casa di reclusione, pressati fino alla nausea, alla repulsione
Chiamami “Opera” che mi danno la prigione, niente premio Nobel
Segui la mia traccia, feromone, 709
Io sono il disco non chi lo canta, sto in una gabbia e mi avvilisco
Il futuro sopprime colui che negli occhi lo guarda, è un basilisco
Qua tutto cambia, prima tra i santi dopo sei l’anticristo
Ho un buco in pancia, qua non si mangia, neanche gli avanzi, visto?

Ma la gente ascolta la musica, non ascolta la coerenza 
E sono mariuolo avido tra tanti ladri d’oro platino e diamanti
Io mi immolo perché ho davanti il mio ruolo che mi inchioda, rabbi
E non sono più di moda, Calvin, sul mio conto slogan blandi
Chiudi un occhio quindi gioca a dardi con il mio di volto non di Giovanardi
Io copia fisica, in custodia cautelare rigida o digipack
Chi mi vuole far visita, digita, ho meno spazio che in una classifica minicar
Sulle mie note qualcuno ci sniffa strisce di chimica 
Musica pericolosa per finta: strisce di Kriminal
Ho un titolo di studio stampato su copertina 
Ma non mi prende nessuno, qua non è più come prima
Cerco me stesso quindi un supporto che ormai nessuno può darmi

Capercaillie,"Cold December dawn 
The party's over and the thrill is gone 
Tears are at your feet 
They're running down the empty street 
 
But I know for certain 
Every time you fall 
You will rise again 
Above it all 
 
Fly the way you do 
The way you dream when love is new 
Try to understand 
It couldn't last the way you planned 
 
And I know for certain 
Every time you fall 
You will rise again 
Above it all 
 
You'll wake to a different drum 
In a place to call your own 
Your world is shaking but a day will come 
For a dream to take you home 
 
But I know for certain 
Every time you fall 
You will rise again 
Above it all 
You will rise again 
Above it all",You Will Rise Again,
Capercaillie,"What's the spring breathing jasmine and rose
What's the summer with all its gay train
What's the splendor of autumn to those
Who've bartered their freedom for gain. 
Let the love of our land's sacred rights
To the love of our people succeed
Let friendship and honour unite
And flourish on both sides of the Tweed. 
No sweetness the senses can cheer
Which corruption and bribery bind
No brightness the sun can e'er clear
For honour's the sum of the mind. 
Let virtue distinguish the brave
Place riches in lowest degree
Think them poorest who can be a slave
Them richest who dare to be free",Both Sides the Tweed,1992
Capercaillie,"When you return they'll see
My words are true 
I went to the hazelwood yesterday
Seeking hazelnuts for food
But on every branch and twig
Was your pursuing face
I went to bed early last night
To escape you in sleep
But you kept me awake till
I'd make you a song 
When you return they'll see
My words are true 
I'd wish we were torn asunder
Were we not apart
Let your presence replace my image of you
And how I'd rejoice
You've brought me to foolish babbling
Tiring friends with praise of you
When you return they'll see that
My words are true 
When you return they'll see
My words are true
They'll see mountains dance with ripples
Mole and eagle step the reel
Red rasp held by kind sea-tangle
Sport before their eyes
My words are true
When you return, etc. to fade out",When You Return,1995
Capercaillie,"With a crime of passion lie those dreams of yesterday 
Broken like the snows of January 
Silence will fall on those masters of shame 
When the family garden wakes to spring again 
 
Under the moon and over land 
Make the shadows of the chosen one 
With words of mercy in his hand 
He walks the path of peace a wounded man 
 
Out of sight and out of mind 
The devil`s staircase winding high 
Make it secret make it sudden 
And the family garden wakes to frosty ground 
 
In Europe's towns tonight 
They lie awake again to fear the dawn 
An endless story of empty glory 
 
Days of love are hard to find 
One man`s rose is another`s thorn 
But the winds of change they write the tune 
And the family garden wakes to song again",Crime of Passion,1995
Capercaillie,"Water lapping round my knees 
Golden sand beneath my feet 
Would mean a lot to me 
There`s very little you can say 
To make those feelings go away 
Till you take me 
 
There`s nothing more that I prefer 
To see the boys and the girls 
Step it out with grace and pride 
As honesty flows by your side 
 
I cannot run from times hard pressed 
To become embittered, dispossessed 
Just like some do 
And maybe some place I can find 
Where wheel and heart become entwined 
Like I hope to 
 
And nothing matters more to you 
To sit and sing a song that`s true 
The first one there and last to leave 
Sweet memories for you to keep 
 
No easy lesson for me to learn 
Just to close those eyes of mock concern 
And halt your rush to be sincere 
There`s more in life for you to fear",Grace and Pride,1995
Capercaillie,"Welcome Mother Nature
 Welcome to your home
 Welcome to the place you used to own
 Decorations fading
 The writing on the wall
 Illusions of an era free for all 
 Your eyes will need a shelter
 A shelter from the pain
 Soaring smoke and burning drops of rain
 And all around society
 Is living on a prayer
 Religion holding fort from despair 
 The heat wave of a thousand fears
 Rainbows from a million tears
 Echoes of a symphony playing on your mind
 And even when the mornings clear
 Its hard to find a reason for
 The miracle of you and me
 The miracle of being 
 Reflection on the water
 Your face is still as night
 Staring like a curse in the frozen light
 The prince of hidden treasure
 He's kissed the green above
 And realised a ripple of your love",The Miracle of Being,1995
Capercaillie,"You paint me pictures that fade so fast
 To try and fool me
 You give me words that will never last
 But you won't rule me 
 I shield my skin from the stinging rain
 My eyes I cover
 I walk across these privileged fields
 To the sound of the clumsy lover 
 If you think you can hold me down
 I beg to differ
 If you think you can twist my words
 I'll sing forever 
 You cannot change a mother's love for her child
 With the ill you bring
 You're sending gifts that nobody wants
 With the cool fresh winds of spring 
 You change your shape and you change your face
 So I can't see you
 You travel from a different land 
 But I can feel you",Stinging Rain,1995

But you're pulling the roots from a dying age

Watching o'er the village of Burns

Washing away the soul from the land?

Free was the fishing in the coves of care

Empty for the sake of summer's cause

Capercaillie,"You come to my table, oh so down in the heart
You stay over iced margarita while other worlds can fall apart
Now we could be happy to be who we are
But some things run deeper than you;ll ever say
On the darkest of blue days
You cry for these red skies above you
Your eyes watch for someone to love you
What's wrong, why won't you touch me
I've only one heart like your own
And no more to hide
What's wrong, why won't you trust me
You're walking through shadows alone 
While I'm chilled to the bone by your side
You know the secret, isn't love just a little like hate
When it smiles at the window and roars like a lion at the gate
Fine words come like friends to your rescue
They lie by your side and caress you
What's wrong, why won't you touch me
I've only one heart like your own
And no more to hide
What's wrong, why won't you trust me
You're walking through shadows alone

Capercaillie,"Man`s illusions fill my mind, like a sacred flower I have to find 
The changing seasons work their charm, clouding these times of calm 
 
But only you can kiss the pain away 
And only you can wish the rains away 
Only you, Only you 
know how to make me feel this way 
 
Your hand can heal my blinding eyes, your fingers melt my icy ways 
Words, whispers, sighs and cries, your world becomes my time alive 
 
But only you can kiss the pain away 
And only you can wish the rains away 
Only you, Only you 
know how to make me feel this way 
 
Snows are melting here tonight, winds are silent, fading light 
My eyes well like a rising tide, my feet will walk the final mile 
 
But only you can kiss the pain 
And only you can wish the rains away 
Only you, Only you 
know how to make me feel this way",You,1996
Capercaillie,"It rarely makes the news today, the place where I was born
They called it a wasteland, a wilderness gone wrong
Where the twisted trees have fallen, the branches stripped and bare
In the silence of the night time, innocence is here.
I embraced my father's warnings, and studied in your schools
to justify your theories and convoluted rules
Traveled to the corners, where everybody knows
My country's been wearing, the emperor's clothes
Beautiful Wasteland, is me
Beautiful Wasteland, is me
If only you'll see, you'll believe.
I'll take you there, to the bracken slopes, where the summer's rolling in.
I'll take you there.
We're lying by the ocean, our western breeze is still
She's the heart of all seasons, a mother to my soul
When the century is over, and the shipping days are done
Like a child for the first time I will lie here again.",Beautiful Wasteland,1997

Who`ve bartered their freedom for gain. 
 
Let the love of our land`s sacred rights 
To the love of our people succeed

Which corruption and bribery bind 
No brightness the sun can e`er clear

Yo, hier ist Capital Bra
Ich mach' den Song nur für euch, ich lieb' euch über alles
Damit ihr immer wisst, ich lieb' euch über alles
Ihr seid das Wichtigste, das Beste
Das Schönste, was ich je bekommen hab'
Ah, ah

Und als ihr beide in mein Leben kamt (Leben kamt)
Hatt' ich zum ersten Mal im Leben Angst
Ich wollte mich verändern, zum ersten Mal im Leben
Ich hatte nix, doch wollte euch die Welt zu Füßen legen
Denn das, was ihr mir gabt, gab mir kein Mensch auf dieser Welt
Sowas kauft man nicht mit Geld
Ich schau' euch an und seh' mich selbst
Ich halt' euch fest, ich lass' euch nie wieder gehen, ihr habt das 
Schönste Lachen und die bittersten Tränen
Es können nicht viele verstehen
Doch für euch, würd' ich die Welt verändern
Endlich Frieden schaffen, alles steh'n und liegen lassen
Wie oft hab' ich für Geld die Freiheit riskiert
Doch würd' mein ganzes Geld verbrennen, nur damit ihr nicht friert
Scheiß auf Geld und auf Fame
Das hat alles keinen Wert (keinen Wert)
Denn wenn ich euch vermisse, blutet mein Herz
Doch wir sind eine starke Fam und hinter euch sind tausend Löwen
Glaub mir, euer Onkel Miri würde für euch beide töten

Glaub mir (glaub mir)
Ich wurd' viel zu oft enttäuscht
Ich hatt' keinen, der mich so liebt, wie ich euch

Ich wollte Geld machen, hab' immer Streit gesucht
Doch ein Blick von euch hat mir gesagt, ich wäre reich genug
Bis zum letzten Atemzug würd' ich für euch beide kämpfen
Denn nix auf dieser fucking Welt könnte euch zwei ersetzten
Ich brech' durch alle Grenzen und bau' euch neue Wege
Wenn ihr wollt, bau' ich euch Brücken über Meere
Weil ich für euch alles gebe, wenn es sein muss, meine Seele
Oder ist sie schon längst weg für diese Rapverträge?

Ich kam her mit drei Monate Aufenthalt
Ich kochte innerlich, doch mir war trotzdem kalt
Du willst der Stärkste sein? Bra, du kommst nicht weit
Was bringt dir der Respekt, wenn deine Mutter dann zuhause weint?
Und eure Nazis sind schon lustig, gucken Anime
Holen bei Kanaken Schnee, doch wählen dann die AfD
Ich bin auch ein Mensch, weil ich auch Fehler mache
Doch das, was diese Leute machen, nennt man Selbstverarsche
Du gehst klauen mit deinen Jungs und ihr springt über Zäune
Aber sag mir, wer von denen sind deine wahren Freunde?
Ich mein', vielleicht macht ihr Business und verkauft paar Kisten
Aber wer von denen würde für dich drei Jahre sitzen?
Auf einmal sind das alles Brüder und tun einen auf Fam
Doch läuft's nicht mehr tun sie so, als ob sie dich nicht kennen
Ich erzähl' dir nur vom Leben, Bra, damit du lernst
Denn um weiter hier zu kommen, brauchst du ein gutes Herz
Und dann kommst du weit, glaub mir, Bra, dann kommst du weit
Was für Knarre? Mit Erfolg killst du jeden Feind
Zu viel Hass und Neid, scheiß auf die ganzen Hater
Wer schweigt, hört viel, doch wer schreit, hört nur sich selber
Die Menschen werden kälter, die Augen immer leerer
Und spricht man über ihre Fehler, wechseln sie das Thema
Ich erzähl' dir nur vom Leben, Bra, damit du lernst
Denn um weiter hier zu kommen, brauchst du ein gutes Herz

Du brauchst ein gutes Herz, weil es nicht anders geht
Denn egal, was du auch machst, nur deine Absicht zählt
Mama meinte mal zu mir: „Diese Welt ist hässlich
Doch weißt du nicht, wie du handeln musst, dann handel menschlich!“
Egal, ob arm und reich, schwarz und weiß
Denn am Ende des Tages bluten alle gleich
Ich erzähl' dir nur vom Leben, Bra, damit du lernst
Denn um weiter hier zu kommen, brauchst du ein gutes Herz

Eins weiß ich
Gefälligkeiten bekommen ihre Preis-Leistung
Loyalitäten laufen einseitig
Menschen benehmen sich so, als ob hier Steinzeit ist
Lachen ins Gesicht, aber ficken sich dann gleichzeitig
Ich bin verwirrt, denn als ich nix war, hat sich keiner für mich interessiert
Heute stehen sie hinter mir
Freunde haben mir meinen Erfolg sicherlich gegönnt
Doch was bringt das, wenn sie Niederlagen nicht teilen können?
Ich bin in guten Zeiten da, auch wenn es unsinnig klingt
Doch wusste nicht, dass ich in schlechten Zeiten Luft für sie bin
Enttäuschungen können Gift in deinen Venen sein
Die Motivation der Sinn deines Lebens sein
Wir beide zum Beispiel können mit dem Stift von der Seele schreiben
Auf das dieses Gefühl uns wie der Wind durch die Segel treibt
Wir kamen mit nix aus 'ner schweren Zeit
Und setzten einen Schritt in die Ewigkeit

Du brauchst ein gutes Herz, weil es nicht anders geht

'Cause you refuse to lift a hand 
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand 
And if I were you I'd fear myself 
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth

And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?) 
Make him detour to the sore 
And let's wash away his bigot sins 
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends 
And let them see what they really like

Here we go.. yo.. whassup?
I got a story to tell, yaknahmsayin?
Yo, it's talkin about this family.. yaknahmsayin?
They kinda caught up, but yo
I want y'all to check it out as I kick a lil somethin like this

Yo once upon a time lived a family of all black
They used to live middle class, yo happy and all that
But then, until when like yo who would believe
yo that pops was the hooker, moms was the crackfiend
with no 9's to 5's to survive in the real world
And as for the little girl, and cousin named James Earl
They had to make ends meet, startin from scratch be	
While pops hold the cash, moms is gettin smashed in the den
And I be sittin thinkin yo like when
this madness would like stop, this crazy shit would end
So yo I'd spend (what) many many moons in my room
Look just chillin by myself and no one else cause I was like shook
by this rotten scandalous, low-life dirty work
Then moms and pops they gazed thinkin shit I was really hurt
So what shall I do?
With this major problem, cause I don't have a clue

Damn, I can't believe it
Uhh, and ya don't stop, I can't believe it
Yo - I can't believe it!
Yo, I can't believe it

Cause I remember when my parents used to stress that fact
That if you smoke crack that it be hard for you to comeback
to your normal self but now she's messin up her health, why'know
pawnin jewels and things and sellin sweaters off her shelf
Now hold up a second see, wait just a minute
Now don't say that this smokin crack shit's a epidemic
but now I guess it is cause my moms is caught up in it
But if I seek for help, do you think she'd be like widdit?
Nah hell naw, cause she be on missions for crumbs like bums
Moms is now strung, so now we stay up in the slums
Uptown, while pops is turnin tricks like a clown
And deep inside my heart I wish my parents like slow down
you know, and give it all a rest
Cause everyday I think about it yo it has me stressed
every whichaway but still I maintains my studies
A shadow is my buddy cause my parents don't hug me

Damn, I can't believe it
And ya don't stop, I can't believe it
I can't believe it
Aiyyo, I can't believe it

Yo..

Now here we go
Now what's the matter pops, gettin sweated by the cops
for standin on the corner, you're bound to be a goner
yo one of these days, but still you needs to clock your dough
Even if that means desertin your family to be a giga-hoe
But yo, I'm tryin to get this shit
Yo why there's no food on the table, and yo, who's payin the rent?
While James Earl was thievin on the banks
with homemade shanks, tryin to scuffle up his rank
But I can't, go out that way, so yo I pray like everynight
to God that he let my cousin see the light, right
But still, they all needs to chill
and all come correct, and maintain some self-respect
And not neglect, the one who loves them dearly
with all of my heart (no lie) no lie, sincerely
But one day soon I hope my family'll wake up
and like smell the coffee brewin, brewin
before their lives is ruined

Uhh, yo, I can't believe it
I just can't why'know, I can't believe it
Uhh, I can't believe it

Now as for myself it's kinda hard to not give a heck
about my parents and cousin who's really bein ignorant
As I strive to be all I can be and more see
A senior in high school, and man it ain't easy
With problems at the crib, plus teachers be expectin
me to do well, in these times that are hectic
But I needs to focus on my family first
on gettin us back together, cause the shit is gettin worse
and worse, it's really terrible
Way out of hand, and damn I don't understand
Why is all of this here, happenin Samantha
I always asked myself, but never had an answer
I wonder - one day, would things ever get better
with me my moms and pops and my cousin back together
Some say never but when I sleep I'm always dreamin
It's really scary to say cause damn man, why'know,
I can't believe it
Yo check it, I can't believe it
I just can't, I just can't, aiyyo, I can't believe it
Word up, I can't believe it

The Time has come for the blood to run into the streets paved with gold 
We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long 
And like animals we kill each other for the hatred of others 
We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance 
For the horror of death  that is part of our life in our neighborhood 
And give them a taste of the same 
And when we kill the governments children 
And the streets smell of death 
Maybe then we will see our situation in a new light 
And put an end the the chaos in the ghetto and an end to the killings

Broke out the asylum and killed a girl 
Just to warm you, just to get it on 
'Cause I'm gonna be cutting throats till the break of dawn

I've always been a psycho now they coming with me 
That's straight when we team up 
'Cause I believe every throat deserves a good cut 
Look in my brain its fucking insane 
Roll around naked in the acid rain 
Rich bitch fucka took me for a sucka 
Now we killing you instead of killing each other 
Walked in the house, shot him in the mouth 
Leaned back the head, and pulled the brains out 
My list are strong its only a saw 
The government fronts like they don't know what is going on 
Fuck, I'll take the matter in my own hands 
Cut ya down cat, cut ya down 
'Cause I know the rich go jogging 
And I'm waiting in the bushes, axe to the noggin

It is a river that drowns the tender reed.
Some say love,
It is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love,
It is a hunger, an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
And you it's only seed.
It's the heart, afraid of breaking,
That never learns to dance.
It's the dream, afraid of waking,
That never takes a chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give.
And the soul, afraid of dying,
That never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely,
And the road has been to long,
And you think that love is only for
The lucky and the strong

Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose.",The Rose (From the Rose),2017

If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic

Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish

And it is a deep river to cross
The road is rocky and rough
So I can't afford for my soul to lost

And I cannot take this no longer
And I cannot bear this no more
Tired to see my sisters and brothers
Convicted and ignored

So I got to fetch the righteous key
And I got to open sesame
And I got to set the captive free
And I got to hail His majesty
And I got to emancipate myself from mental slavery

Oh, oh, he bingi man will never get weary
The rastaman will never grow old
That's why the half has never been told
But the bingi man come fi clean up dem soul
The bingi man will never get weary
The rastaman will have his reward

But Jah, Jah bless I with the strength
And the comfort of His love
So long the liar bring this out
And you no read between the lines

Then oonu woulda see what the rastaman find
The truth and the love that is so divine
Unity, strength and we have fi combine
This is a collective mission everyone have to join

Any means necessary a method we have to find
To stop all the war, poverty and crime
Politics and religion we have fi lef that behind
Can't go a Zion with no carnal mind

Look how we a warn dem time after time
Be your brother's keeper and you sister same time
Remember that you mother and you father is divine
To righteousness you must always incline, oonu see Jah sign

Did you know destruction of the flesh is not di ending to life
Fear not of the anti-Christ
Did you know that I exist before the Earth
An did you know that my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and wear Jerry curls

Before little brothers and chalks and
Imagine somebody say ""That's your son dead"" and
See us
We do the crime, we do the time
You get away scott free
So the police they gon' pop you for they pop me
'Cause if you get me, you got me, you shot me, no lock me
Carry shotty's since mom slapped me 'cause mi room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp, it's me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ran with me, for semi

Raise plenty a few dollars

Watch em run, hit the floor

Stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road
Miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic
Blow through the air
So keep in realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion
Can one be happy here

But some would rather to be so unfair

The mind/ People scared to be themselves/ Seem happy
To live a lie/ Give thanks for collie weed/ Never ever
Sniff a line/ Conquering Lion/ 225th in line/ If we say
We're ""Pro-War""/ Only in the fight for peace/ Man, that
Means no war/ Think the price of life is cheap?/ But
We're saying ""No More""/ Righteous recognize the beast/
Fireman'll baptize/ Burn 'em the light and heat/ Forward
To the power in a phrase like/ ""Acts Of God""/ Prophet
Said he saw the flood waters rise/ And the flow was hard/
I was really shocked to see/ The truth was exposed as hard/
While the media was focused/ On the words by Kanye/ What
Was it I just heard the President's Mom say?/ People here
Are frustrated/ Still got a long way/ Fed up but remember/
Self Destruction is the wrong way

Yet when yuh in the dirt they wouldn’t look on you
They would only scorn and wanna wipe the foot on yuh

Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin' fronted
Down a fake rapper haveta bungee
He's in it for the munties, money
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high

If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic
After the whole of them from gone then push up them fists
Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish
Go ahead, speed up your judgment, stand up boy boy

Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

So ahh, and one of these day
When you hear a boy faint then uhh

Ich wurde groß in einem Hochhaus im M-Park
Zwischen Alkoholikern und Drogenhändlern
Was soll ich sagen? Hart waren die Jahre
Vater lag unter der Erde, bevor ich „A“ sagen konnte
Und plötzlich stand Mama ganz allein mit ihren Jungen
Drei Löwen gingen auf Jagd für die Königin des Dschungels
Das Böse lauert im Dunkeln, rötliche Augen funkeln
Wie die Klinge in der Hand von 'nem vierzehnjährigen Jungen
Im Viertel siehst du die Bullen, wie sie drehen ihre Runden
Circa jede Viertelstunde kommt ein gieriger Kunde
Siehst du die toten Gesichter? Keiner wird verschont von seinem Schicksal
Jeder Junk ist so viel wert wie die Shore in der Spritze
Trag' die Pistole an der Hüfte, voll verchromt und sie glitzert
Denn auf den Bäumen aus Beton hilft dir kein Vogelgezwitscher
Und von klein auf trieb es mich dann in die Mainhattangang
Weil mein Vater und mein bester Freund sich einfach erhängen
Ruhet in Frieden! Nimmt einen Schluck, um den Scheiß zu verdrängen
Kein einziger Mensch war da und was bleibt, ist die Gang
Kein Happy End, todsicher nimmt das Leben seinen Lauf
Über kurz oder lang hat jeder seine Seele verkauft
Ich lebe meinen Traum, aber trotzdem ist nicht alles perfekt
Viele Brüder leben heute noch in Armut und Dreck, heh

Easing my pain, lifting my name, predicting I'll see fame
Change that bond that's never broken

Taught me the young, in turn I spoil you now

Just since my born day, and you proud

No matter what, so I'm touched when I spit it this way

And it would hurt, when she see me walking in state greens

Dat dat dat, gun shots all over
And I wasn't there, but if I was
There'd been a lot more gun shots goin' off then they was
So, tell 'em hoes to fix they wig
You see my stomach all round, my dick all big
And my guns come mixed like Robin kids

N O fuck ya life, snatch ya ice
And my coke come white, like Barkley wife
Can't stand how, these niggas be frontin'
Dumpin' off 8 shots, ain't hurtin nuttin'
And who gives a fuck 'bout, who's lyrics is better?
As long as my shit is dope when I put it together
Me and Swizz with another one, hot forever
And you can call Violator, for show that you whoof
I like a Swizz Beat, shit already come with a hook, it go

I know you heard, know you heard
I know you niggas heard
Know you heard, know you heard

Everytime I drop an album, niggas O D
Though I send slugs at ya, and ruin your day
Your like ""Man there's holes in me, it won't go away""
And I'm a straight surgeon, I'll change ya face up
You'll have no ear, when I lace ya shape up
'Cause really N O, I don't fuck with niggas
And if you even met me, you just a lucky nigga

Niggas always talk about how much jewels they got
But nigga I talk guns, that's usually hot
And 9 times out of 10 they gon' usually pop
It's like herpes, it won't go away, it stay hot
Man, I be spittin' like these niggas is dead
'Cause I'm a get my money, these niggas is dead
So what, I be hype, I be ready to buc
From the closet, I keep my fuckin' gear in the truck, it go

Tell me you heard

Yo, yo, yo, got the Lap Truck, tell them hoes to lap up
Hit me on the 2-way, my phone is tapped up
Matter of fact, don't even hit me, it's too much low
But if ya hit me on the pager, then use them codes
I got the feds on me, I'm supplying the coke
And don't flash no money, I act tight broke
'Cause man, I'm in this game with somethin' to prove
Only been a hood tour, no smoke to groove

I was on a record label that loved to loose
No promotions, lucky when we hit the news
Beef, it don't bother us, we got God with us
Rip some pieces of niggas, we got 'card with us
Man, Swizz'd drop it, I'm ready to do it
Don't think a nigga nice, these niggas is stupid
Man, signed a deal, rap'd sell
And these niggas straight gay, these niggas is squeel, it go

I know you heard, know you heard

Capone,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga

[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, ""T.O.N.Y."" remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who want to set it

[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get ranked on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin

The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

[Nas]
Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, want to know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, are fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your hoe, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed 'cause

And if she don't give you brain then you dodge the bitch

Yo its Melvin the african godfather

Ducking the cops they stay searching
The elevators ain't working the steps too pissy 
Thoro bread god son rep the bridge with me

Fuck a thugs cry nigga shoot that's why god put em here for

Capone,"Wish I could holla an' you physically listen, ma picture me shitting
Came far from chopping crack in the kitchen
Hated when I was a thug, couldn't understand it
Put me through school, swore soon I'd be in a position to rule

Look at me now, your only child breathing through you
For you, by you, the science of FUBU, ill creation
I'm still laying for that day I wake up
Out of this dream, see you kinetically move, a seventies jewel

A star's born, in the form of man, deep like Elijah
Mommy's only prophet speaking the logic
Now momma love said if I ever get rich
And you not alive, watch for the snakes, 'cause they got to survive

don't acknowledge the lies, or the gossip
Stay true to yourself
And don't do what your pop's did
I love you mommy forever

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here

To the streets of my house someone not a nine, through hard times
Mom's was so strong you one of my heart's pride
And you told me I would shine in time, never win, but you know
Through you I spit and make the whole globe glow

I zone on all the things you ever did for me, my grief as a kid
Easing my pain, lifting my name, predicting I'll see fame
Change that bond that's never broken
You my heart for life, put ice on the surface of your soul glowing

To my moms straight royal, look at your boy now
Taught me the young, in turn I spoil you now
Don't even worry I'm a hold you down not far from now
When you see me and the way you've been
Just since my born day, and you proud

No matter what, so I'm touched when I spit it this way
I pray you'll be smiling for the rest of your days around
Always at my best, and that's 'cause of you
Always calm and watch you raise me to be top notch

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here

Yo I'm a keep this gangsta, and still be G
My moms is for my seeds, my moms for me
Always been by my side, when I needed her most
When I was locked in a cell, holding her close

Visit after visit, she will always be there
My father would never cry, wouldn't shed one tear
My mother exact opposite, by all means
And it would hurt, when she see me walking in state greens

I be like ma chill, 'cause it's all good
In just two more year's I'll be back in the hood
My father, he got sick, my mother couldn't take it
She called me the night he died, said he ain't make it

All hysterical, phone dropped off the dresser
Ma you calm down, you got high blood pressure
See I understand that I got to be the man
And take care of my wife, kids, and the fam, specially you ma

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here

Mama love, old earth for what it's worth
Sorry for all the times that I made you hurt
I know it was hard work, mother of three
Who would of thought your baby be running the street crazily'

You told me to stick to the dean, I lusted the cream
57 Fav queens with cracks in my jeans
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what you said
Didn't want to lose me to jail over some quick bread, or end up dead

Eyes bloodshed, watching your tears shed
Damn a nigga making his bed
About to lie in, I want to change, but I ain't trying
It ain't justifying, my grand pops dying

Moms, I'm sorry for the pain, there's sunshine after the rain
My past shame it's hard to explain
Can I make you happy' I love to see you smile
For your life while, ma it's our turn now

Love your moms hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here

Love your moms and hate the streets
Love your moms and hate the heat
Love your moms while she resting in peace
Love your moms while she still here
Hug your moms when she shedding a tear

I told you fools to stop fuckin' with the Maqi
Arab Nazi, blow holes in your Versace
This war's mega, with the arm legga legga
Been doin' this, since Mobb Six with Cormega
Gorilla, animal thugs be trife looking, your hearts tookin'
And got blown in Central Booking
I'm mad iller, organized thug killer
Now you little monkey niggas wanna play gorilla
Officially, Mousallini, punk he me
Insanity, temporarily my plea
And the jakes never worry me as long as I'm free
To my people holdin packs, nuthin less than a G
Crime side of life, foul price to pay
Illegal life, trigger trife till we old and gray
When the flesh dry up and the world decay
Reach heaven in a pearly white accuray
But until then, I'm a shine to the last sin
Resurrect through the birth of my son, and live again

Roll dice, and break 'em on the street corner

Been around you, play close, but wasn't close to you

A stress day, police watch the twelve ""K""

Next to death's kiko, is goin to jail
Unassisted, I shivered and frail

Mad chickens for my thugs locked, low on the mail

Right every bill I stack another war, story and track
Settle down for money; hungry cats peddle the crack
Some strive to be the man but never make it that's the granted further
What part you playin the game, who gonna slash worker
Some'll pray to Jesus, I pray to Jes to free us
Don't look for bail Rufus bail Criminal Court
When a judge holla Father you sure?
Cats never sent a nigga to jail, they send him bail
I been as real as I stealin free lunch
I got the greats from this old man give me hearse and,
I made a move from a plan scauwered new land (fuck a blue van)
My shoes bang, fictitious niggaz, walk in the path that I lead (I lead)
Do crime in New York, money and murder
Gentleman talk, ball like Atlanta Hawk
No respect, this on the stacks of the court
I started off in the street thing, triple it's on
[Chorus]
[M.A.Z.E.]
Ya niggaz livin a lie, spittin the same
Its no room, no BI for y'all in the game
See me I, stay where it pop
Off the chain like my diss and it rocks
Movin the same is the strippin the spot
I'm hot, rock glizzery from the bottom to top
Grizzy, don't let it pop, didn't he spy on these hoes
To piss off the killer in me
Me and six will slick through it (through it)
Bronx river to the con do it
I see Don P calm as me, like spazin dead on your cheek
Like green to my eye, shit, write it down sincere
Get to say my name in the air
Niggaz pipe down, put they mic down
Niggaz scared that we ain't even drop yet
Yet this year we show ya all who the hottest (hottest)
The projects, I rep to my death (rep it nigga!)
X'd out hoes, we regulate (X'd out hoes!)
We ain't sharin or fillin 'boes; see how we go?
[Chorus] - with Noreaga adlibs
[Noreaga]
Keep the Mac under the seat
To fast niggaz ready to creep
And my niggaz stayin with heat
Like the hook go - what son what!?
Like the shit go - what son what!?
See me in the hood though
With a hood though, with a little puppet
And we doing no good though
Pussy sub, pussy sub, through the club
Niggaz don't need no math
I rather, get head, I don't need no ass
Fuck all of y'all, y'all don't really rep for me
I mean you, and you ain't the set for me
I'm in different vicinities, gettin high with your enemies
So niggaz better stop playin
Before I get the M-One and just start sprayin
Keep your block on lock, so now you go
Nigga, I sell bricks like my name Alpo
[Chorus]
[Mussolini]
It's no rumor what you hear about us in clubs
Or freight some young Blood
No vest protect the shot for your mug
Snake niggaz hear the move, every chance they get
Rap niggaz I'ma dead 'em on the advance they get
Hustlin niggaz, I catch y'all Uptown
Soon as papi hit you, I'm right behind you holding it down
Ya niggaz, got it confused
Pop bottles and boo's
Might fit, make you come out of your jewels
A little more richer
Every sixteenth spit a little more sicker
Rap for M.A.Z.E. cause that's my nigga
I spit it for the streets
My bitches and freaks, lacking four to twenty G's
Thugging every week, stylin out, Violator I'm wildin out
MU and thugged out, them hoes talkin about

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm like Rich Porter, the epitome of Alpo
AZ and Nicky Barnes, I rock sticky thumbs
I chopped it, and I cooked till my hands got numb
Shotguns malt-liquor and ones
I used to pay homage and wanted to play to be a fat cat
Someone like Castro, mad cash flow
Me and 'Pone like the best in the business
Niggas show love, hoes show interest
My gun game - got my pops to blame
I used to hop over fences and buck in the rain
And I'm not that nigga that'll fuck ya dame
I'm true to my niggas, hop out the car
Hand on my mac, cock back, ready to clap
Up in Iraq, see my niggas hustlin' crack
The same scheme from Queens when you livin' your dreams
You gotta sell things if you're looking for fiends

I know crips, yo crips even be in Iraq
I know young bloods and niggas like O.G. Mack
I dropped out in seventh grade and I knew I'd be straight
I went O.T. and then I copped bricks for eight
I cut black bitches off for at least three weeks
I had Spanish hoes spittin nuts on the seats
I see Jesus in my kids but it's silly to me
How I see Him in them, don't see Him in me

[Capone]
I blanks out, my nigga knight just hit the bricks
I'm not a rapper, I sell a lot of crack but spit
Niggas that I'm cool with, I only keep a nigga hot
Say I'm on some new shit, then I cock the pop
The other side of the game, doin' fifty y'all
I survived behind the wall and the feds for y'all
Similar to ""Hurricane,"" harassed half my life
I got a right to flash my ice, crash the Vipe

When everything goes sour, I got my dog
I squeezed off went through the pound and locked my doors
I'm not scared of your guns, I got shot before
Niggas' jewels got little rocks like Arkansas
I'm the, prophet of B.I.G., but never the next
I'm the first in every verse spit shit get worse
You can hate me, or wish I'd lie in a hearse
Respect my game, who the best? Select my name
I salute niggas in jail, I'm big as Latrell
On the street, you need heat? Ask Dominican Will
My cliqua's off the meter, we come gunnin' bullets
Whistle past your ear, like police in London
We the best that ever did it, the rest never lived it
Gettin' bucked at a bing-time, stressed on a visit
I'm Y2K in a flesh, the future at it's best
Nevertheless I pop metal to death

Word to Motha..that nigga Nore'

Entertainment...know what I'm sayin'? Niggas still in the streets...
Ill Will, Braveheart nigga, there's a thin line between streets and business..
So we gotta have balance and be easy...

I heard you fags want to catch me off guard
Put Tecks to my heart, the death of Escobar
Under your breath, whispers in the dark
I hear it 'cause the street ain't loyal to choose sides

Prepare for the beef, whoever lose dies
Rich and I'm thuggin'
I can't trust nothin', this bitch that I'm fuckin'
This clip that I'm bustin' could jam in my fist

Look at my hand, finger pussy with expensive rings
Cut coke cookies, wrote poetry and broke noses B.
The voice from Heaven 

I'm God sent, of course a legend
This is part 1, speak my sermon, the hood reverend
Blunted eyes red
C-Class, a Hundred times Five Red

CD's blast, speed fast, haters drop dead
I'm gorgeous
black Goddess flip the arm rest, flip the cordless 
Her body stacks the best, ass is flawless
Finally the long awaited shit, ghetto people the sequel
Nas, CNN, nobody's equal.

Keep the club off the heezy
Straight thugs in the back, drink creezy
Be easy, but we still smoke treezy
See us rippin' the shows with thugged easy.

Niggas picked me the boss
Ricky Ross
Lex Two-Fifty Horse power, click and devour the source
If it's flour then swallow your loss

I cock Fours, kick in Poppi's doors
All for the cash and the cause
Niggas break big fractions of laws
So what, we got it sewn up, smack every cat on the board

I speak the truth, guns spit at you, shakin' my palm
It's pitiful, wavin' my wand
The Don, a hundred follow me like Farrakhan
Chasin' my Henny, embrace Benny's

It's quite Frank, my niggas will kill, never waste a Penny
Money stay well invested
Feel the weight on my necklace
When death is too close flip the next shit

Thug the game out
Bust biscuits, pull the Range out
Public enemy, Queens Bridge where I hang out
Sweet scent of weed I wear like a fragrance
My energy's kinetic, mind power type ancient.

[Chorus]

I see death through the corner, die, kingdom come
Six 500's, pull up right in front of the slum
Sticky green fingers soldiers of the great God
Clarence spoke to the poor but he lived in Oz

An ill hook like Roy Jones, I'm a street corner bastard
And crush weed with the hashish
Bandanna head dome wrapped
Caddy trucks with the grills and the chrome snaps

I'm on point like Al Sharpton, come peep the M.U. marksman
The S-Class is shittin' on your weak Datsun
Graffiti written on the Bible, my life is wicked
I see dead corpses, and Rolls Royces

Put your heart on your lap, listen you hear voices 
My whole persona is the drama and to smoke skama
I can lift it up, Willy what in front of your slut
Money bustin' out my pocket, your bank is stopped

I give the kidney, just so the lord will forgive me
And bring back mami and mambo, mano a mano

Opposite like Felix and Oscar
Sign to the street like Carlos 
We sway deeper than the shit through the speaker

Up north sport away for the cesaer
Used to smuggle through the mess hall, 
Blow a stiff circle in the yard
Be home now, stuck in our zone now
Can't take it from us, we run wit the corner

Smoke weed out of bible papers

See me with a Northface, facing the north
Drinking Schmirnoff and taking niggas face right off
N.O.R., and shit ain't really change that much 
Except I smoke a Philly can't fuck wit her guts

Boneless chicken, and she don't cook no pork
I got some Chardonnay, nigga go and pop the cork
Me and Capone made up, everytime we fought

Yo, yo, yo, I'ma have to stand up
Take game, I got grabbed up
Asking me questions, interogating
The way the hatin, they just remind me of satan
Keep em motivating, police asking questions about this and this
I don't know shit, and hell no, I don't know 5 or 6
I'm confined to a small room
I celly off to my beeper, thought I had to sues
And the headache, was the feelings for me and my crew
To take impostas, impalas and black sues
Big boys, and LL cues
I'm thinking like deep cover
I'm in too deep, like Donny Brasco
Who could be the asshole
I make sure the motherfucker don't last long
Roll to the castle where my niggas be, triggas be
Blowin they backs out, they felt the misery
And the decision be, spill coffee
Who's on the beats I can't be locked up
They had evidence, make the scenery all dense
But it's Ok my lawyer will approach the bench

I don't know nobody, and I ain't seen shit

Put me in cuffs, motherfucker hand in your benz

Pop, they caught me off guard
I was stuck the beat shit fucked
I went down to my knees
And put out the trees
I sat down on the benches
He snuck his dog on my five senses
All I could hear was a walky talky saying ""I got em""
I'm asking the charge, yeah you know he shot em
We biscuit printed plus your first henes borrowin
I ain't heard nuff yet, next day daily news read
Murder suspect, 19, down in Queens
Day of rainment where he had slim chance to win it
Two asses from bail so they gave glances
It's Friday, had to lay for the weekend stretch
First thing, Monday morning, calling for street connects
Man I forgot the machine they callin for
Fuck a message all they need is it playin back
I'm confined a 8 by 12 flat
With bums niggas who sell crack
Flippin off the the world

It's like 4 in the morning and the crib sleeping easily
My dogs got me off feet face me slow down
I'm like what the fuck the deal
He's like the shut the fuck up
We got evidence, we know the deal
They got tape confessions of your man
Whiping out your man
Key witness to the stands
I should have played yours
The moving bar to my moms get the news to bar
Same time Jake taking me out
Same line gonna try and fake me out
Sitting in the van pointing face out
Soon as I hit the plan, the course going close the plan
Take em out, take em out, before the court day out

Lay low, and hollow him out
And pones is wilding too

Blows from the walky talky, gonna fuck me up

Just you and Baby D, ain't nobody depending on me
Saying if I won't talk, I'll wait in the cell
They got evidence to leave me in jail
There's no time for this shit
Just sign the statement
If you snitching, you won't have to say shit

He try to pin me for murder
And a string of robberies

You say you lookin' for a lover Boo, someone you can talk to
I walk these streets, tryin' hard not to hawk you
Laugh when they stalk you, playin' my cards
Weighin' the odds, I see your face like a mirage
Your hair tied in a bun, with a chopstick through it
Your frames make you look erotic, exotic twist
Don't know I'm a thug, but I'm sentimental
Cried when Cochese died; a villain need a girlfriend too
Love it when they play shy and if I ever fall in love
See this babyface? Swear I never tell a lie
Gossip got you hatin' me so much right now
Like Kelis, ready to call police, give 'em all the heat
You know I'm on parole, so you chose not to beep for a week
Couldn't see your man goin up creek
Fuck the B.I.'s, the letters, and the short-eye pictures
I'ma ride for my bitches, if they ride for my niggaz

Earth in the physical flesh, a certified star

We can lay up, breakfast when you wake up
A covergirl, lovin' your world, fly no make-up
Ain't nuttin' change, I stay sunk in the Range
I get brain, switch lanes when I'm pluckin' a dame
Hit your job on your lunch break, the spots they can take
Make a date later this week, so we can celebrate
Knew my hustle, you never did try to knock it
The first true thug in your life, I got you in the pocket
Wasn't with the sneakin' thing, the hill showed your appeal
You keep it real with the feminine feel
I still love the stretch socks and your Reeboks
I love my mami's, konichi-wa, and your nani-nani

How does it feel for you to be in my world
Even my girl shoppin' sprees Monopoly cheese, coppin you pearls
Sautee or foreplay, all day
From the bedroom, to the hallway, I'm all in her toes
Open my nose, love it when you go downtown
Hold a freak too, I'd love to see you, in somethin' see-through
Beep daddy, I come and eat you
Speedin' in a Caddy buck on the (?), room three-two

I have my pitbulls tear you up
I have my lil' homies in the hood, come and just, scare you up
You don't be in the hood, you a weak-ass clown
And when you come through, you have your niggaz holdin' you down
And when I hold heat I just hold it for delf
Why ask a nigga to shoot when I'ma buck myself?
I keep my gun by my dick so I can touch myself

Yo, I keep chapped lips, I smoke Persian blunts
I used to shop in Albee Square..
But now I shop in Queens, I tell my niggaz I'll be here
On M.U. block yo cause I don't care
With my nigga Mike (?) blow 'dro through the sunroof
Jeckyll'n'Hyde and purple haze
And I still be in Brooklyn, and party with Maze
I got a ghetto pass, yo and still I let the metal blast
Click click click, niggaz is assed
We Thugged Out, them niggaz that'll steal your stash
If you a bitch, yo we niggaz that'll slap your ass
Whattup cliqua? We can be lah, M-A
And stab these niggaz up, no problem-a
And leave 'em leaked out, stab him in his ass have a cheek out
Have 'em trapped in the room, can't sneak out
With a sign on the door, that say keep out

[Chorus] 

Yo I made a song about ""he'd"" and now bitches love me
They knowin' they can give me head but they can't fuck me
I ran trains for Nino, even my old C.O.
I even ran trains with my A&R Gino
Sometimes, I drink Smirnoff without no juice
And I'ma ride for my niggaz, Baby D and Dukes
Thugged Out and M.U., we just tripled our troops
We added more niggaz, and gave 'em gats and boots
And for the niggaz that bend down get minks and goose
See me, I'm not greedy, not at all
Hit me at the office, yo 2-1-2, 5-6-3, 8-4-8-4
So why y'all niggaz gon' wait for, runnin' out of state for?

He rolls Phillies and he busts the big the four-fifth

On the are train now me and 5 in the Range
We used to twist Phillies and fuck hoes, switch cars and trade guns

Iraq and the Bridge, the only difference is the buildings
The same crime rates and the same damn killings
A slice of pizza, and quarter water my juice
But now I'm Car hart and bullet proof is under my goose
And go to hell to that nigga that snitched on deuce

We keep guns on our sides, you know how dunn thugs do
'cause I'll be there with my thugs, I'll be right here waiting on you

For my niggaz who bust pies, the customized fives
To the vals, to the railroaded trails I cuss cops
Enough shots and any generation
I spit dead a plot in the making, I ride for every thug in the basement
My soul is cuffed to the corner, every gate, every car table
Every welcome to the hood sign, batting good times
It's on over the projects a dark cloud one sided
Till death bitches burning in gossip

It's my turn to deposit the real, the logic, no college
Just dollars and criminal knowledge
Me and my codies, pass [unverified]
I flash mo' wheat, than cash Cody, keep the mac on me
When you stack niggaz act phony
Shit in the ghetto, I spread love and shed blood
Never swear to a dead thug
My name should be brought up in fame
Never said in vain, spread like a letter chain in criminal slang

We done had some time, I strive to get my shine
On the block, slanging rocks 'cause the world is mine
I look out for you, and you look out for me
And we hold it down, you just wait and see

Beard 8 and a third, and my piece be Orca
There's no need for peace offers, my niggas be shootin', we riot
We run the streets quiet, 'cause the law's biased
Skip the battles back in 86, now niggaz tattle, chop crazy bricks
Cop new kicks, quick to say they rich
Fantasize and flatten the hills, for niggaz in ghettos
Its crack, bullets that kill, dreams are fulfilled
Murders, ink in cold blood, holdin' grudges for years
I keep two bitches, two hot biscuits, four dot sixes

I hope they don't act like we won't smack to back of their cerebellum
Oh and did I mention? if I feel tension
Get the full arm extension, get the whole block's attention

My sixteens'll rip through beats, cut deeper than diamonds
Make ya niggaz start to worry 'cause my hood is dark and blurry
When shots flurry, niggaz point guard like Marbury
Ain't no arguing, all my click'll do is get the targeting
Final Chapter split pies in two, its half bargaining
I've seen you niggaz come up quick and then fall
I've seen you frontin' for your broad like her pussy's the bomb

I'm still on the run eatin' so I got chubby
I spaz up in the Tunnel, stab niggaz with pens

I be in New York smokin' LA weed
I hate a bitch named Pebbles like LA Reed
I dead niggaz like Pac and Big, blocks to live
These niggaz can't eat like hostages
Fuck Camry's and fuck Honda Accords
I rob niggaz like the Crips at the Source Awards
And everything that went down was cool with me
As long as I came back with my jewelry
We had machine guns, I think we had two or three

Cheddar chasin' my federation
Dedication to the street, crazy court casin'
Three strike loser, life facin', Chyna white lacin'
Marksman, Bumpy Johnson
Capone Of Arc, a lone shark
Tinted Z3's, you either in it for the love
A thug for the cheese
My crew maxin', June Jacksons,
Free of taxes baby cream pediatrics

Flyest nigga bitches give it up to the highest bidder
Holdin' brigets, the more ice, the more sex
I'm Meyer Lansky of the projects, Fox's 'Charlotte O'Neil'
Nore's hoes they Star Tek
Creep when my squad rest, more or less
I'll have your family dressed
Niggas eulogizing part of your vest
I run with gunners and smokers
I'm a bad influence to bitches with kids
Have 'em in the hood, gun in their stroller

Run yo shit niggas

Run yo shit bitches

Run yo shit niggas

Run yo shit bitches

Capone-N-Noreaga,"Yo I grew up like the regular thug sold drugs 
Wasn't proud about it, but this is what I gotta do 
I copped the Jordan's, and the Fila's, too 
Yo, I loved the Bo Jackson's, the orange and blue 
Used to snatch Lee patches, now I wear Cartier glasses 
Thinkin' that the earth's axis, 
Revolves around my waist.. and how the fuck I feel 
Yo I played ball for Vince, yo I handled the pill 
Then it dawned on me, came strong on me 
I belonged with these, niggaz thuggin' with me 
So I switched crews, started rollin' with the older dudes 
Drinkin' brews, did what they say, and paid dues 
My hands dirty, trying to keep little Lea 
And got jerked, the first time I tried to re-up 
People my age, tried to say slow my speed up 
'Cause I smoked bogies, staked on weed up 

[Chorus]
I love my life (Love my life, yo) 
Sold drugs my life (Did it all in my time) 
Its my whole life (Live it up) 
I sacrificed (Sacrificed twice) 
This game we play (Play for keeps) 
I live and pray (Control the streets) 
Hear her say (Yo, just live your life, baby, live your life,baby) 
Ooo, yeah 

These is the days of sparkin', I used to roll with Rob Profit 
Troy Outlaw, Freddie Bedrock, and Joe Wood 
Runni'n in Timbo's ???, shine shoes 
Section Two, part of Iraq I grew up at 
Had to learn how to slapbox, instead of a gat 
I never knew rap, all I knew was crack 
Yo there's rules to this game, and people to blame 
When you see another little brother doing the same 
As you used to 
Growing up like you 
Palyin' skully, with his heat out, cellular phone 
Getting little drug money, but got the world sewn 
I recall, cause he gonna die 
Yo, I cry 
It's hard to, get tarred up with God jewel, part two 
Smily got shot up to (Rest in peace) 
Aiyyo, you realize that you miss a nigga (miss him) 
When you realize (realize) that you never gonna see him again 

[Chorus]

Aiyyo, its totally, up to the team, to me 
So don't, make a move if you don't ask me 
I'm, casually known, halfly blown 
In Miami, cause now Uncle Wise came home 
Jello, copped me a Role', copped them one, too 
You keep it real with a person, keep it real with you 
Use confidence, Thugged Out aimed for dominance 
Nostradam' in this, he slits wrists just like Glomerus 
??, Grenad', iced out for Tito 
Puerto Rico, we live life now cause we know 
The other side of the fence stay friendly 
Its just war in there, done, there ain't no Henny 
I can't live that, déjà vu, I did that 
I gained stats, rumblin' cats over Kit Kats 
Now I spit raps, park my Benz where the chicks at 
And just live with a big stack

Moving 
Shut the fuck up 

Ay Yo Ay yo Regardless of rain or snow sleet or hail 
I kick street tales choking niggas like I'm sprewell 
Golden state holding your fate in the palm of my hand 
Blow you away like its part of the plan 
I gotta call it like I see it talk it like I be it 
Walkin my walk thugged out orthopedic 
Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up 
Niggas try to stick me like abdul lerima, follow the leader 
Make me go extra hard, yo nore should I hold back or show the repirtore 
Quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers 
I show them why its so hard to reach us 
I get pussy with my fathers features 
Puff heavenly, see me at 6'1"" weigh a buck 70 
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be 
Packed in like green bay 
Harlem week to queens day 
Performing acapella, no dj 
98 live, no replays 
Make it seem easy, so tell a friend to tell a friend 
That its them again, nature noreaga, wild gremlins 

Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks 
Pour on the fort knox lazura 
Shark salad with cabbage 
Pork chops and applesauce 
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in 
Pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training 
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst 
Simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed 
Uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead 
I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said 
Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money 
Like Johnny handsome 
Been sonning niggas for so long 
I think I got a grandson 
My passion is money, a stash and a honey 
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody 
That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in 
Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
Just a little ghetto 
Where my niggas control the middle 
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 

Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
Wages, I wrote six aces 
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
Cats like to rip places 
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
But I stay in import the pig places 
But the world know the girl though 
I fuck her off a furlough 
She'll be up, hook me up 
All your sales could be luck 
Only question for these ducks is 
Baby girl can we fuck 
You the type that need a wife 
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life 
Asshole, yo I don't play around 
I lay it down 
Fuck around, I spray around 
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it 
My ass, you can kick or kiss it 

Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this 
(bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips 
Like 2 thirds of a brick (penaro and kiss) 
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip 
See the plan is to stash all, and cash y'all 
The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars 
Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
'cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
I'm about to have no feelings 
Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
Shit that they kick in ya ear 
When your soul be drifting in air 
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die 
They say you get what you ask for, so get it 'cause you asked for it 
If a nigga ain't a thief, then he better have the cash for it 
And we gonna be around til ya body rott 
And if the feds bring us in we get the same time gotti got 

What!what! what! what! 

Yo,yo! ay yo, there's two ways into the hood, one plain 
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain 
Ay yo lets get loose, Hennesey straight, with tomato juice 
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian 
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions 
I play the best hood, o-t with Tim Westwood 
Used to be on section 8, now my section is good 
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could 
And I don't give a fuck what! yo I save my shit

That's why I never do a song with you

Ya, what? you found Manuel Noreaga?
In the Phillipines?
He has a mansion?
Ok, we on it, on it, right now,  right

Run laps around the english channel
Neptunes, I got a cockerspaniel
We on the run now, yo, it ain't no fun now
And where I go, you niggas can't even come now
You hate the law, nigga break it, I don't care
And when ya get caught, remember that I don't care
N.O.R.E., blow you off the atmosphere
Yo for now we on the run, yo if that ain't clear
Weak niggas wanna stick, you but that ain't fair
You we down in vegas, money, skies too courageous
And yo, I'm on the run, but still rip stages
And call me animal thug, when I'm in cages
I used to proof phrases, rolled dice with no aces
Now I'm just included in the oasis
Gotta take faces, no time  for car races
Check my sky, tell I got five pages

What

Yo hit Lousiana, then Atlanta, Indiana
Forget a city slicker got country grammar
Ayo we goin places, where my sound scan ain't tough
So when I say I ain't Nore, yo it ain't that rough
I leave the jake in my fake, askin all this stuff
I gotta keep my mouth shut and don't say what, what
But yo its hard to, Netherlands got the heart to
Yo from New Orleans, L.A., V.A. to Queens
The I-95, now we hit the Phillipines
But now its different, we gotta stay sober

While you whips is just garbation
Is you knowin what you facin?

Gotta get the cash yo
And its live or die

And when Capone come home, we gon' triple the cent

Rockin air and better, like a Mexican
Shottin' at my pops, cause yo next to him
He told me every thug nigga is a gentlemen
So I took heed, take my time sitll won't speed
Yo a nigga got kids, so my family need

And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up

Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin'
See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'

She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God

Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies
Kid I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbin, ready for robbin

City niggaz who for blood money rockin Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket
In the streets while these people mark money in their Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jumps
Caught before a fake twenty dollar bill
Get em son, we ain't the one
Politickin, purse vickin, sick of these Dominicans

Yeah, talkin' bout, get that money up
Birth of Don', what up Rae? What up Ghost?

I'm a lyrical arson, my technique is awesome
Verbal murderer darts and settle the beat metamorphis
Step into my office, I torch this, for chips I cost this
More hits, no water hits, unrecord this
I swing a sword quick, original Don' for hire
I attack microphones and set 'em on fire
Welcome to my environment of ill vocal attire
Pass the wire, it's the twelve o'clock rock
That makes the hip hop beats, dart armanilla
Straight Killa Hilla, ol' school joints and Miller
Baggy jeans, the gun-gums vest in the dumb-dumbs

Staten Island been wildin', so Osama's nothing
And my niggaz out in Brooklyn said Saddam was frontin'
Gotta squad, what you think, it ain't no guns or something?
Picture Me Rollin', holdin' less than a one or somethin'
You fake faggots, yeah we got that big automatic
Like, Bruce Willis and the Jackal type, yeah, right
You want to see it? Then get on my nerves
Oh you live, and I'm gettin' money spit on my curb
In the hood where it get no harder, only tougher
Crack fiends suffer, baby moms, baby brother
Hustlin', still forty off a hundred packs
I'd rather lounge in the back of the bar
Me and my dog throw crack in the jar
Listen to this rap star, while I sit back in the car
And I told ya'll niggaz how the Staten rock
We don't, trick on chicks, yo we clap them shots
You get caught if you ask a lot, like you don't know
And where you at, then ya ass is got

We bringin' back the Twin Towers, 20-0-3, crack game electronic
Conceived with slow jams by The Delfonics
At a level that you should of been years ago
Responsible usually for coke traffic, usually for broken bone tragic
Rest in peace, to Mayor Guliani's term
They say I'm wrong, shit
I'm try'nna see 26, with my daughters at the Emmy Awards
All around the ball glowin', they got the weed flow droughted
Or maybe niggaz in the hood just ain't 'bout it
Talkin' Hercules, and ain't nothin' but dog food
Staten Island, New York City drools
Crazy glue on my fingerprints
Name on the concrete of my hood, what's really good?
Vendetta's with these rap stars
Frontin' like this crime and the pet is they cars
Believe I was God in my last life
What if it was your knife? What if they was your gloves, nigga..

Aiyo, I came into this game on some real love shit
And ya'll bitch ass niggaz, ya'll wanted me to quit
Because the way I dress ill and the way that I spit
But I ain't never gon' stop, droppin' these joints
And ya'll fake ass niggaz, ya'll ain't gettin' no points
Don't try to sabotage me, 'cause you just can't do it
You had me in the Square, last year, but you blew it
Big Donna from the group home, that's my word
Splash shots at your whip, splash shots at your bird
Leave your brains and your Gucci boots up on the curb
Pillage for life, Allah's will be the most superb
Smoke weed with the cannon, smoke the herb
So bow down, all you crab ass clowns you can't live
My gun's on empty, but it's more shots to give
I pop you like a slave cop, run in your crib
Throw darts at your wife, throw darts at your kid
Leave your house flooded with hits like O.J. did
Escapin' the crime scene and you love how I slid

[Verse One: RZA]
Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt solos
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this b**** advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Bla** and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

Pele egg-head the top dresser
One man catalog the London Fog casual hog
Biere denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket he gripped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy started haveta brown skin derby
Master Tommy Hil Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cap and fleece wear
One wear plaids the Don will hold the best for all wear
Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on
We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear

Ain't what you want baby

Satisfaction guaranteed baby
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I want to know just how low

Yo, what's the deal Goldilocks?
Ain't nothing I'm just hibernating, love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvoisier
No doubt, have a chair Boo lets get to pollying
Who you with? Me and Molly and some trick who's Yugoslavian
What fabric is that? It's only wool and Rayon
Lipstick crayon, fly Fahrenheit spray on
I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transporting bricks stealing many fifties
Fuck negotiating, is you with me is you waiting
Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban links skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser
I'm like the jewelry exchange plus a range
Nigga you small change I only fuck for figaro chains
Analyzing Miss Clairol, Fendi down, mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon

Socializing, vibing with my eyes on Dot
She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot
While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister to brother
I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover

What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet wrapped around your leg
Here have a seat, complimentary drinks is on me
Bartender, Chevalier Chateau at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
Sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that five?
Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour
Wish I would've bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side
We holding hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left my Wis' a thousand times maybe tonight though
Yo you sexy motherfucker, damn what's the recipe?
You make a nigga wanna god damn!
Can you cook darling? At the stove you're evolving
Baked macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder",Camay,1996
Cappadonna,"We are the G, O-D's
And we came to rock, the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Bees

Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge
Knowledgists, street astrologists
Light up the mic God, knowledge this
Fly joints that carried your points
Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, he pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Rapel on fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union
It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style
On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials
Especially that, aluminum bat in the act
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex
Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem
Abusing em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbin niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Body chemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My Benz spills, what up Lils
Murder one Dunn
Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it
And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang
Sweep it out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is handcocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects
Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin

We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties

Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like eskimo flow
Cappa villain stay chillin' take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine

Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jewelin', tri-color Cubans
Swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper

[Cappadonna]
Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap para-medical the wizard
Cappadonna, never caterin' to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You oughta five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin'
For violatin' my position,
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
'Cause I'm P-L-O T-K-O every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school just go infernal
Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin'
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin'
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards

(The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. 
I want 'em layin' out. I want 'em gotten. 
'Cause niggas need to be gotten. 
He need to be taken off of here. 
That's right.)",Iron Maiden,1996
Cappadonna,"Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld tote mm-hmm

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more

A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA Rob name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound, and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching",Winter Warz,1996

Headlock show the block kid counterattack 
Don of mine stay connect 4th Disciple trife 
Ain't nuthin ice cream, kid you get blown like steam 
Park Hill Projects, the black Idi Amin 
Ninety-six era, not the crossover lever

So what now? Industry kids'll lock it down 
Only two loyal, dustin that find you there for 
You wanted to enter thirty-six in the soil 
My technique is speak have you knocked out weak 
Forever in it, my slang dick goes so deep 
Thirsty for hip-hop, Staten Isle niggaz can't stop 
Runnin wild like a child till we reach the top 
Stapleton, New Bright, and West Brighton the harbor 
Connect, me for vet, Don King and a tech 
Thug cats'll get done up on black man's sun up 
Cap the imperial, bring out new material 
You hold me down, analyze all cherry-head 
Wu is in town, catch the hand-off 
Prepare for my dancehall standoff 
Mercy when I come blow your mic-hand off, sorry I touched him 
Here they come again through customs 
Mad ways to dead the wax one way to bust him 
Chorus: 
If it's alright with you it's alright with me 
We can take this rap game to a higher degree 
We can do this Spike Lee or how you want it to be 
Check it, Golden Arms plus new Cappadon 
Verse Two: you-God, AKA Golden Arms 
These ninety-nine powerful circling swords 
Impact from all the heat dug deep and locked on 
Chip off the bone, hard face and hard fists 
Chop off your option, have you felt a neck twist 
Cassette disc and wrist, meltdown your pistol mist 
Burnt to a crisp, bombarded my pistol grip 
Tongue gripped the nigga, raw tone the jawbone 
Leaning Tower Pisa sounds of the Mars zone 
Chef dropped that bomb, the takeout will still linger 
Twenty crazy christians, to lock in hole and heat up 
Who the finger rap singer with hip layers of phlegm 
Caused by blunt smoke, heart disease plays the friend 
I ran out emotion, my rap style's devotion 
I got hosts for you Soviet peoples across the ocean 
My path releases, volcanic acids 
Engage in the page activity is autographics 
Fraction of my busting microphones start to lust and 
words plays over power practice might bust em 
The black male persuasion known to hunt you for sane 
The Big Apple verbal concert, for the occasion 
The vital snap, now insert my Spinal Tap 
I got forty more swipes to pipe, thirty slapped 
The power from the cram broke the bottom of the pan 
With Earth Wind and Fire, ice water dead grams 
American hustler up and coming with a vengeance 
Makes no magnet charge, plug vivid my extension 
one lesson motivation for my pistol profestation 
Slang person nailed now we move on a motation 
Location, point-blank, on point be the vessel 
Politic the defecit measure, point the decibel 
We're credible, renaissance, eatin off the barrel 
Advanced chemo, Die Hard to my demo

Cappadonna,"Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ashcan ass
Blew my hole in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you shoulda seen her
She had a Babyface creamer Purina's
Called up talkin' Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon
I had her walkin' on the moon

Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin' your time
Oh you shine, I'm lookin' at your ass from behind
You walked by smellin' like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin'
My nuts start yellin', excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy
After that we can cheat
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat
Long stroke smack it, smack it then broke
Nothin' can't stop my continuous poke
Compound porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it

Dirt Dog be bouncin' on bitches like frog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin' this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty
I like it muddy or swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fuckin' room me and my momma and my TV
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doin' the breeze, in my 850

Suicidal
She been in more hotels than bibles
Idle worshippin' bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf
Cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons
Big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sendin' her gifts to women and enjoyed
To watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void and shameless
Her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession, caused niggas to get, the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

You people are all trying to achieve the impossible
(That's exactly what we've done)
But you'll fail, and you'll all die

And the one after them, for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed)",Maria,1997

My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman

A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelmin' the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect pyrhiffic pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream

Poetry whirlpool, Rza and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hard boiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers

Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)

Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer

Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me jury cleaner, Million Man March screamers
Rae Cartegna, cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino

Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients

My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under keep lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, your trail end thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master

I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
Fuck you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown I advise

Box talk sequence, powerhouse kick out
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatcher batcher went to fresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dumb be clapped, mummy wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Damer sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass whoopin' flurry shake, break you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin' hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This death bent doctrine, paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth

Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
Workin' hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like jaws, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article CappaFive, CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive

That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon live what he did what this nigga said
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me some niggas in Medina askin' me
""You know some niggas in the gold E-Class,"" splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it could have got us both sprayed up
They seen the Ac, noticed Jada
Hair salon, treating shorty like Quran
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a car wash now, her little Keon doing triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
For a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her

When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggas whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound, not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your cliché
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue

Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb

Dipped everyday my style is po lit'

I'm headed to the club tonight  we need toast 
For that wack ass MC  talkin' all the shit 
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split

But we still lickin' off, we wild like two cent

Fuck y'all cats, we always got guns

We gotta fuck somethin' up, dead or alive

After the tour I came back for more 
Comin' correctly, just like before 
Wu-Tang Forever, I was just a pirate 
In the rec room regulatin' with Osirus 
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts 
Minds on lease like expensive imports 
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed 
Livin' life long time may continue to breed 
Never gettin' caught up inside the agencies 
For ten long years, but I paid my fee 
Now I'm on the front line with W.T.C. 
Back me down these streets are still ill 
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill 
Pack with the beef cause niggaz won't chill 
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill 
I'm takin' this shit way back to Bill Bill 
In the projects where my man got killed

When the world go around these things start to happen 
Wifey in the kitchen, brother still snitchin' 
Bloods accumulatin', we gettin' impatient 
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understandin' 
That's how I'm plannin', blow up like a cannon 
Pull my man in, hit y'all again 
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent 
Build with intelligence break your defense 
No hesitation, time gets spent 
Some fall victim, others get bent

Stuck with the poles forever, what

Lyrics that kill, murder one voice 
Chill or get dropped, your weak team ain't appropriate to no lessons 
Adolescence, rhyme war, encore, surrender to my rap, I'm stuck on the map 
Like I told you before winter war, in these days of hardcore 
Smoke never stop clearing, stop cheering, you making me hot 
Acid rain, a capella, wet you 
And upset you, get you death threat, on cassette, it's the project

Without My Radio, a 100 Miles and Runnin 
T2 Judgment comin', nobody's safe 
When I reminisce about Case, still hit the staircase 
When the coppers give chase, I give em finger 
The only hip-hop singer, to tell America 
To kiss his Killer Bee stinger, nothin can save ya 
From this major misbehavior, heavy hands 
Layin' corners in the elevator, guard your grill 

[Cappadonna] 
I speculate, get my darts straight, don't exaggerate 
Dictate, do it with the Papermate, set the plate 
Set the bait, checkmate, fuckin' with cha mental state 
Double take, meditate, earthquake, VGL contemplate 
Big boys integrate; catch you at the sess skate 
Army tank, high rank, got the bank 
Got the shank talk the talk walk the walk from New York 
To Up North to downstate to L.A., to all day 
To cliches to instant replays, to all the DJ's 
To PJ's, in the PJ's, equality days 
With money like legs I plant eggs, Pele roundhead 
The dog bred, snakes runnin' from red, catch dead 
Big born is on take the uniform, we perform 
Shit like gangs are now born check for new dawn 
Fuck a you Conn, you been warned, we the realest 
We never were conned, duffed out and knowledge born

Cappadonna,"[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]
You left me here alone with a shine 
Our hearts were strong but I couldn't find 
My world alone how could I break my home 
Still I doubted you and still your strength 
Enchanted me you was the father to my child 
And a man to me now I'm sung of strong hearts 
Run free run free young hearts 
Young hearts run free 
Run free young hearts 

[Cappadonna] 
Girlfriend, what you did was wrong 
Even though the love was strong, you moved on 
Never had faith in the Don, you was safe 
With the Don, and then you walked out 
A broken house, a broken heart 
Cry for my dart, we had a plan 
We was woman and man, the hourglass 
Held the sand, I held you like contraband 
But you didn't understand when the four devils 
Came inside of your life that night 
We argued and fight, you knew it wasn't right 
Fucked up our life, my thoughts come stronger 
Every ounce, it's not my fault 
That you wanted to bounce, now you tellin' me 
That you cleaned up your act, beep me every time 
But I never call back, that's how I felt 
When you was makin' me crack 
Me leave wifey for you?? 
I'm crying 
I'm crying

Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Through the damage to the wannabe Flipmode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers 
My word of mouth it's all real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage

Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin large

AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound 
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromisin
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggaz not keepin it real
Dirtball niggaz that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggaz I be wantin on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats and my man keep em bustin till he's gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
'Donna come through everyday my uniform
changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggaz get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack kid
Watch how the slang hits you, just like the fat kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
on a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean

Cappadonna,"Excuse me gorgeous..
Just maxin  lookin for hoes  why'know  relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine  midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb  that tranked her nerves  calm words
Massaged the mentals  made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous  brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned  Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in  take a spin  destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'

She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule
They call me Starky Love-hun, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's

Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me

Ain't nuttin nice in, New York, stick ya for ya cake and ya icin
All that tough talk don't mean nuttin when ya up north
So keep them hands where I can see them like ya want freedom
You know that sayin, if ya can't join 'em
Beat 'em and push ya way in

Yo, this is based on a true story, from a Man that lost land

I'm goin' all out, I love trout 
Black is what I be about
95-south all the way up, I tear mics up
Peep the conduct, wherever lightning struck
Tear the jail up, truck with the mind food 
Truck with jewels, forget Babylon rules
I'm crusin' with the angels
Goin' through Parkhill, let the Gods build and all of that
Graduation hats, bigger stacks
Ya'll hardly ever seen besides cream
I got the vaccine for ya'll uncle Tom rappers
I told y'll before to be easy, Devils attackin' is practice
Provocative songs, yeah It's Donna, don't even panic
Hold ya'll like the Atlantic
Pillage at your service 
Clubs start to get nervous
Loose lips, it's like emptyin' clips
Packed with the info, join the revolution
Slang prostitution, even if you boostin'
Play it like you still chill, homicide hill from the other side
My Mother sighed, strugglin, poor and tired
A Baby that never cried, a family that never died
I see everything from the outside.

O.T.F. and The Pillage, we all comin' through
Watch your back nigga, and your girl watch it too
'Cause we conduct big business, raw is how we give this
Live this, that's how we conduct big business
O.T.F. and The Pillage, hide your shine nigga
When we come through, might have to jump on you
'Cause we conduct big business, raw is how we live this
Give this, that's how we conduct big business.

Benz Jeep with big boy heat, a Thirty-Thirty
Shotgun, pull it out and show you what a thug about
 
Ya'll niggas is pussy, that's why ya'll get atein' out
Niggas hate me now 'cause I be so jig my A.K.A. oughta be Shawn Carter
My heart bigger than my ego, eho
I put my heart on the line and hit both free throws
Yeah, build with a parole hole
Guzzle the old Gold with no bag, on the bliddock
Holdin' the gliddock, you can't fuck with this shit ock
Locks it down like JT from the mothafuckin' liddot
S is for my Sons, H I'm not havin' it 'cause I'm not the one
A is for the ammo that I keep for my gidd-uns
Be ???	 is for the blood, bandanas, and the bidd-uns
See is for the crips, comrads, and the Kenyon
We a-alike, be	-alike, so we see alike
I roll with niggas that stay in jail like Iron Mike
I get hype, and keep it gully, interrupt commercial shit. 

[Chorus]

God, keep shinin' your light, I got a calling
Felt like the Angels were fallin'
But with this God given mic I restored the faith
My love for the prophets keeps me safe
See, I don't have to worry 'cause I know God is great
If it wasn't for the Father it wouldn't be a Bill Gates
No Bill Clinton, no United States
Peep it, explore my mind like a secret
If the music ain't good, ya'll won't leak it
So I give thanks and praise to the almighty
The spirit in the music hit ya'll lightly
Motown Hip-Hop, don't try to fight me
I call on the arch angel, cast out the hate
All-time Cappacino the great

Revenge so sweet that you might want to flip 
Ride on your enemies, bust they shit
Throw away the pistols throw away the clips

Big grits, big ox snatch ice at Woodstock
Remember those kids that hold cries they runnin' fast
Crack spillin' out they sides
It's the Hill brothers that kill
And raps on a blue trap water bugs nothin' but thugs
Cops circlin', two cuts on shorty mugged
Streets turn by the fliest of bug
It's switch the e-shit fucker
I take rhymes like a piss
Eat the beats like tuna fish
Stay focused, your camp is dead meat and drop worms

The super friends seek that revenge
Bout to fuck out, you kiss girls on the mouth

Guns from my Ceridoor ask mic ammo

Follow the path, knowledge the craft
Swallow a whole bottle of math
Since biology class
Grand achery, bow and arrow split your grand largely
Afro in ya heads, robin hoods drop goods in these wild lands
A desert eagle in a child's hands
Your style's planned, my styles blend earth, wind, fire, water
You never know my son might fuck Mariah's daughter
Ill visions of victory without a battle
Breathes through tracks like cold winds towards Seattle
Sound travels through fiber optics under gravel
Combinating six sixty and they try to handle
Niggas try to handle

Yo we always had a eight on us
 
Cold hands slingin' niggas gotta pay on us
Co-froze our whole shit so you can skate on us
Niggas don't freeze long, start to rain on us
I'm the type tah hold the mac with one hand
Squeez that shit till the gun jam
Flow sickly rhyme swettin' I'm too ill
Get blown quickly for two mills
Ice pick ain't too real sing your nice six swing to kill
Who runnin' with the kid that brang me the pill?
Who runnin' with the kid I'm like stainless steel
Frail nigga on some high and might, break your grill
Showtime there's a joke time I poll on the box
Poke lots of little holes in you like four little dots
Become my doja and balloon swallow them rocks
Shit out my profit hole by tomorrow you drop

[Chorus]

There's a place out there where the enemies lurk
In the woods try to burn down mamma's church 
No love, they came to spread hate
The angels floried inside the pearl gates
The world got dark, a earthquake 
trembled the underneath of the feet of pedestrians
Rain, drops fire and snowflakes
Destroy homes that contain the mad evil
All of God's children ran towards the ?
For all of those who did wrong to the ?
Their souls were cast out into the deep
Bodies of the unholy covered the street
And all of God's creatures ate them like meat
Oh father have mercy on the weak
The ones that can't see and the ones that can't speak
The ones in the projects smokin' that leaf
Who lived through slavery, families got beat
Bit by the dogs, shot by the police
Screaming for justice, screaming for peace
Brothers behind bars fighting with the beast
Third world countries plus the Mid East
We all gon die if the battles don't cease

Sex on the first night that's how I roll
Fronting on a crust being assed in the cold
Try to play live what?

Rack my Versace but can't pay the toll
All Cappuchino women why'all got to go

A couple of years before the Wu was even on
They love the way I dress captivated by my charm
If you see me in the cut I'm just steadily calm
It's a regular females be under my arm
Ever since i got paid to start dropping the bombs
I could take 2 women my nickname is LONG
Crushing is involved I'm doing the James Bond
Grant you a fantasy then I be gone
That's under the hat the way I made you come back
From the shoes to the hat
All of my shit match
I'm like a book of matches
I'm always on strike
I'm double-jointed I can do it how you like
Come to Keisha house
Yeah it's only right
We can get together for a glass of ice
And if the kids here something we can tell them it's a fight
I love my 2 seeds more than my own life
It's hard to escape punani appitite
I see a pretty face I start falling in love
No matter what baby girl I just can't get enough
Because THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU!

But I know a spot to kick your heels off

I'm not as Dirty as that bastard be

Gold stud in the bottom lip, and diamonds in her tongue pierce
Shook what her mama gave her, a Playboy bunny
And plus she tail links with a major player
And that's nothing but scandal, and hot wax
Drippin' on your back, incense smoke and mad candles
Body paints, graffiti on your flesh, spray painted on the walls like vandals

Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Hey yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong
Right before she went to rest she had me singing this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know
She had the high-glow's switching
See her in the club you hear others chicks bitching
But Dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit
See she did 12 months over a ratchet
Not no crab shit
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab shit
Clit was hanging out her panties with no where to stash it
It was classic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helping me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat
Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Licking glass bowls in her cat clothes
Cause crazy stacks
Finicky thing
Her kitting drink polar spring
Take naps
Near her jewelry box
She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode
Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Hey yo, she gotta be gone
Waiting on my sweet strawberry pecan rican LaShawn
Holding my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes
That's why I'm eating her candy
And sucking her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on
On some Marvin Gay shit like lets get it on
Sugar
Lets get it on
Hey yo she a diamond in the rough
Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
Fuck cooking for me
She stash me out when the feds come looking for me
I'm not cheating on her or beating on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creeping on her
She right there when it gets sticky
She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side
Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting
Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue Louis Vutton
Leg muscles, deep dimples
Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet petite ass nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone
It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Ass off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva

She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up
Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holding condoms!
Cause she my bitch, the only cat that I lick
Throwing that ass like Ciara on the top of that whip

Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh

So I take yo' ass out, quick, the mics
I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick

Started smokin' woolas at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater

Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase

It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun funk
I gets you open like a slug from the shotgun pump
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Straight up, you movin' too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down wit' your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this ultimate legit
See you all up in my ass
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a rude descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today?
Huh, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down

Might show up, stun 'em and run 'em when they raggin'
Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Tryin' to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoked out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad fly, flew south for the (winter)
Hey, enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare
I'm goin' to the country, I'm goin' to the fair
To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, cause she love me long time

I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam

Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years

Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity

Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

The bad bitch keep a tool and a bible, quick to murder her rivals
And her pops was a gangsta disciple
He killed about a thousand vice lords, guns and knife wars
The feds came for him, so slick to the night ward
Down in the N.O., and right before he left
He wrote his daughter a memo, left stacks in the Benzo
It got hot, niggas selling, giving out the info
He paranoid, every 20 seconds out the window
Blow it in the limbo, he spazzed on Lorenzo

You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me

When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals

I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger

Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves

Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw

Anything less, makes me a criminal

G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C

I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning

The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

Cappuccino,"I miss you, I miss you

Ich betrete unsere Wohnung zum ersten Mal allein 
Die Stille ist so schön, genauso sollt' es immer sein 
Mein Wunsch war es oft, dass du nicht bei mir bist 
Doch jetzt ohne dich, merk ich erst, wie es ist

Jahre sind vergangen und ich fühlte mich gefangen 
Nun bin ich frei, doch habe Tränen auf den Wangen 
Das Verlangen nach dir wird nun wach 
Zu spät

Ich lieg' da und mach' die Nacht zum Tag 
Und den Tag zur Nacht 
Kämpfe gegen den Schmerz, doch verlier' die Schlacht 
Ich hab' gedacht, ich bin stark und brauche nur mich 
Ich hab' gedacht, dass ich sag': ‚Ich liebe dich nicht'

Jetzt sitz' ich also hier, hier bei Kerzenschein 
Seh' den Schatten an der Wand 
Doch der Schatten ist allein 
Mein Herz ist kalt, ich glaub', ich erfrier' 
Komm doch zurück - du fehlst mir

I miss you since you've been gone babe 
Du fehlst mir 
I miss you want you come back to me? 
I miss you since you've been gone babe 
Du fehlst mir 
I miss you I'm addicted to your love

Ich lauf' umher, bleib' vorm Spiegel steh'n 
Meine Augen hassen den, den sie seh'n 
Sie verstehen nicht das, was ich tat

Ich sehe zum Mond, frag die Sterne um Rat 
Warum liess ich das zu, warum liess ich sie gehen? 
Warum musste der Wind meine Träume verwehen?

Es geschehen so viele Dinge um mich herum 
Ich hör Tausende von Fragen 
Doch die Antwort bleibt stumm

Zum ersten Mal fühl' ich das, was es heisst 
Wenn der Schmerz so beisst, dass dein Herz zerreisst 
Du weisst, du schreist 
Doch du kannst dich nicht hör'n 
Dein Geist entgleist, will sich gegen dich verschwören

Es ist schwer, ohne dich zu sein 
Seh' den Schatten an der Wand, er fängt an zu weinen 
Es ist so kalt, ich glaub', ich erfrier' 
Komm doch zurück - du fehlst mir

I miss you since you've been gone babe 
Du fehlst mir 
I miss you want you come back to me? 
I miss you since you've been gone babe 
Du fehlst mir 
I miss you I'm addicted to your love

Der Schatten verbleicht, die Kerze erlischt 
Ich lege mich ins Bett, hab' die Tränen weggewischt 
Aufgemischt ist mein Inneres, ich bin allein 
Schliesse meine Augen und schlafe ein

Dein Geruch ist überall 
Ich atme ihn ein, spüre dich und ich fall' in Träume 
Sehe dich, sehe mich 
Wir hatten doch 'was, was der Ewigkeit glich 
Ich strich über deine Haut und dein Haar 
Erinnere mich, wie verliebt ich war

Da sind die Schatten, von denen einer jetzt fehlt 
Ich seh', wie die beiden sich lieben 
Es quält mich sosehr, dass ich aufstehen muss 
Mach' die Kerze noch mal an 
Geb' dem Schatten einen Kuss 
Er ist so kalt und riecht nicht nach dir 
Komm doch zurück - du fehlst mir

Denn der Joint ist heiß und ich scheiß auf die Starwelt
Was ich brauch, ist Bargeld 
Interessiert, mich nicht, ob man mich für`n Star hält produzier`ne neue Platte, 
Damit die für mich klarstellt, ich pass schon darauf auf
Dass Cappu nicht auf`n Arsch fällt 
Der Spaß hält alles zusamm` wie das Partyprogramm, doch wenn es Ärger gibt 
Mein Gott, dann hol ich mir`n paar Schrammen, du kriegst `n Autogramm direkt aus Niedersachsen 
Mach nie wieder Faxen wir bewegen Lieder, du die Haxen
Wir wachsen jeden Tag`n Stück 
Gib das Mikro wieder ab und geh zur Arbeit zurück!

Cappuccino,"Ich hab mir die Musik ausgesucht, o.k., jetzt muss ich tanzen 
Die Schule ist vorbei, ade, vergiss den Ranzen 
Verlass die ganzen Sorgen und schlucke die Furcht 
Meine Augen sind offen, also Augen zu und durch 
Doch da ist immer irgend jemand, der mir sagt, dass das nicht geht 
Immer irgend jemand, der das hier nicht versteht 
Da ist immer irgend jemand, der böse Dinge spricht 
Aber soll ich Dir mal was sagen, irgend jemand interessiert mich nicht 
Denn ich bestimm` für mich alleine, was mir wichtig ist 
Nur ich bestimme, was falsch und richtig ist denn 
Meine Freiheit ist Meineid und bricht sie das Gesetz 
Mein Beileid, wenn Ihr nicht frei seid, doch ich leb` I'm hier und jetzt 
Und ich schätz`, bevor ich aufhöre, würd` ich lieber sterben 
Wenn man glaubt, etwas zu sein, hat man aufgehört, etwas zu werden 
Und da ist nichts, was ich nicht werden oder kriegen kann 
Und wenn ich fest dran glaube, dann weiss ich, dass ich fliegen kann 
 
REFRAIN 
Fly, now I can fly I just spread my wings and rise into the sky 
Fly, just watch me fly I just spread my wings and drift into the sky 
Who I know ... I just know that I could fly 
I spread my wings and fly away 
 
Und ich mache mich frei von alledem, was schlecht ist 
Ich brauche keinen Wahrsager, der mir sagt, was echt ist 
Denn dass das Leben manchmal hart und ungerecht ist 
Liegt mir als Vermächtnis I'm Gedächtnis aber 
Ich schöpfe mehr, immer mehr, immer mehr Kraft 
Ich will scheinen, so hell wie`s nur `n Stern schafft 
Entgegen den Gesetzen der Schwerkraft bewegen 
Unter mir die Wolken und der Regen 
Ich brauch nicht überlegen - ich fühle was ich tu 
Solange ich es fühle - spür ich dass ich zu 
Mehr fähig bin, weil ich sehr fähig bin, seh` ich Probleme hinter mir 
Dann stärkt mich das hier drin 
Und ich denke nicht mal dran, mir meine Träume nehm `n zu lassen 
Von Leuten die daneben fassen und ihr eignes Leben hassen 
Denn es gibt nichts, was ich nicht werden oder kriegen kann 
Wenn ich fest dran glaube, dann weiss ich, dass ich fliegen kann 
 
REFRAIN 
Und ich besinne mich auf meinen Stolz, mein Blut, meine Ehre 
Denke mir, was soll`s, nehm` den ganzen Mut und überquere die schwere 
Schwelle vom Dunkel ins Helle - mach mir keine Sorgen über Morgen 
Und ich stelle fest, es lag an mir, hab ich das Ziel nie erreicht 
Doch jetzt wo ich`s versuche, erscheint es kinderleicht 
Vielleicht gibt es ein paar Steine, die I'm Wege liegen 
Da mach ich mir nichts draus, denn ich kann fliegen

We're gonna sail the world
While we are fast asleep.

We get a little lonesome
We get a little lone sometimes.

Caprice,"¿Dónde está nuestro amor?
No sé bien cuál fue el error
Y aunque duela la verdad
Nunca tiene vuelta atrás

Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
But and love is overboard

Tú por mí, yo por ti
Intentando descubrir
Que lección se nos paso

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it
Lessons in love, lost without love

Lessons in love, me duele la verdad
Lessons in love, y busco una señal
Lessons in love, me dices que te vas
Lessons in love, y yo no sé olvidar

Caprice,"Oh, how it hurts loving someone who has someone else
So many nights I've spend here all alone by myself
Whenever you're with him, whose loving me, nobody
Hurry up this way again, I love you, hurry up this way again

I'll never know when I'm going to see you again
Can't make no plans, I just see you whenever I can
What happens in between, I sit and dream about you
Hurry up this way again, I love you, hurry up this way again

So many lives I spend here all alone
I love you, hurry up this way again
I need you, I want you, I don't want nobody else
Hurry up this way again, I love you, hurry up this way again
I love you, hurry up this way again

I've gotta have you, I want you, hurry up this way again
Hurry up this way again, I love you, hurry up this way again

Capsize 7,"I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
To pull sister Flo
My heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low

'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
Letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
And bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it,
She don't make false claims
But she's a Queen,
And such are queens
That your laughter
Is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

To write off lines
