The Weeknd,"I know what you did
I know
So I'ma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
I swear it's okay

'Cause I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything

Now these tops don't twist like they did before
Tried to keep you out
And you are done
But baby it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did, hey
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
Baby it's okay
It's okay

I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything",The Knowing,2011
The Weeknd,"They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em
Is I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So baby take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fucking seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
I'm better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys then I play all day (all day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (all day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day (all day)
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're going
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rolling through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fucking 20, girl
Amnesia
Put your mind in a dream world
What you doing in the bathroom?
I hear noises in the bathroom
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em,
The only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, motherfucker, I'm raw
My love so lost in my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got
If they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Till the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie
Filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk
About it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you're inside it
You excited?

What you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin' about?
Yeah
Oh what you thinkin' about
Oh what you thinkin' about

The Weeknd,"From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alize with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we flying from the north
Rocking with our city like a sold out show
House full of hoes that specialize into hoe-in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen if our haters caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen, fast life gripping
Yeah we still tipping
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Face try to mimic, get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work

Push it to the limit, push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money, a virgin to the fame
So this my only chance so when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom, closer to the top
The higher that I climb, the harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas trying to hold on to their credits
So I tell em use a debit watch they image start to lessen
I wanna 'em like discretion, why these niggas testing
Always fucking testing, why these niggas testing
Shit that I got 'em on, straight bar hopping to the music of the ambiance
Get shit poppin', zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew, get it in like pockets
Downtown loving, when the moon coming
Only place to find base heads and high women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work

Better slow down, she'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga worth her holding
Ain't no nigga that she holding man her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work

There's times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say ""your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story, it made history

Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan of a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell them Taylors
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing comes out without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
Not Motor 1, not old Chevelle
Can't say things like supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
It means haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Pack in the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

You repent when you are done

Well here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
I’ll be quiet this ain't nothing to me

Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry

You'll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking

The Weeknd,"You are the snake, get around me
And it came with rain
Never seen what raining

So I just could lead the way
There’s nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it’s amazing
Elevating as it seems to you
But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when it’s raining?
You were mine

So I’m with you baby
You were to put it else yeah baby
You were right, you made it
You were alright

So I’m with you baby
You were more, I seen no more
You were right to enslave me
I think you would’ve made it

So I just could lead the way
There’s nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it’s amazing
Elevating as it seems to you

The Weeknd,"When the sun goes up, you're﻿ searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us

I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man, can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

Uh

Adapted to these models
Whose adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in love and war, she's pure

So pure,
Like the love that's so uncut and raw and clean
So clean,
As opposed to what I offered because I chose a lie
I chose the lie
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I've let it go
For a little fun
Oh

I've made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

She might just be the one (might just be the one)
Might just be the one

The Weeknd,"When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth she can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again
I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit baby
I'm a little camera shy
But exceptions can be made baby, 'cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here
Only takin' pictures, you gon' have to take your ass home

'Cause the only thing you're takin'
Is your clothes off
Go 'head girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

Get on top of that thang girl

Get on top of that thang girl
Don't hold back

You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right, I might
Fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my west coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep whoah oh
I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong, and never sleep until it's mornin',
'Til the morning, 'cause the only thing you're takin'
Is your clothes off, ey

I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside,
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just twelve months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up and
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day, just to sleep at night
God damn I'm high, my doctor told me to stop
And he gave me something to pop
I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends,
I got XO in my bloodwork and I'm posted up down in Florida,
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk,
White Russian when the sun hits,
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings,
She like the way my whole tongue flip,
She grind hard for tuition,
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills,
I make her suck it with gold grills,
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep

Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Ohhh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Said I-)
Mama don't you worry no no more, worry no no more
I'mma take you from the first to the ninety floor
You always told me what I'm playin', that shit gotta grow
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

No, oh
We don't pray for love, no more
We don't wanna see you on the cover of [?], no more
We don't wanna see you on the news, no more
All alone

Underrated is an understatement
They tryin' to test greatness, a nigga tryin' to get paid
These niggas fiends watchin' all of my moves
Cause the music like crack on me, cookin' all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she want to be wifey
She know that if she got me then she gon' be good for life
So I pull out 'fore the climax
Faster than a hi-hat, sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, don't pray for love
Oh, say love (just ask the lonely)
Just ask the lonely, oh (just ask the lonely)",Pray 4 Love,2015

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad

The West,"It was raining when I woke up this morning 
So to escape I... I went back to bed 
But then the rain started leaking through the ceiling 
And pretty soon it was pouring on my head 

Sometimes it follows you home 
Like an old stray dog 
It won't leave you alone 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

So I jumped into my car and hit the freeway 
Found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean 
From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun, 
And you're landing in the shade 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

Well the moral of the story is 
Sometimes life takes so much more than it gives 
But the One who makes the air I breathe 
Is the One who'll fix the ceiling when it starts to leak 
It may look like the end but it's only the beginning 

It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

Cause It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

It's not the end, it's not the end, 
Still not the end, it's not the end, 
I betcha wonder when this song is gonna end
But it's not the end 'cause I'm singing this song 
And I get to decide when it's the end
And it's not the end , well it's altmost the end, 
Guess you could say it's nearing the end
But it's not the end, it's not the end,
It's not the end, now it's the end",The Beginning (Of the End),2008

The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band,"Your eyes have grown tired of
Hunting for the fox and the owl
For smooth stones
And a safe place to hide
In the hills is near your home

Now you walk with bare feet through the wet sand
And a boy sees you and comes running over
And stands for forty meters away
Wanting to walk on water
To turn you on
But you don't pay any attention at all
As the world rises and falls

Now you have a woman's shape
Thunderbolts in your fingertips
He has his eyes pinned on you
Be careful, he has whips and chains
And he plays ancient games
Over anyone standing in his way
He can change the color of the sky
If he wants to
But its only magic use to him
Don't be easily taken
Or he won't remember you at all
As the world rises and falls

I tried to tell you not to love him
Strongly as you did
You'll go out again someday
But you won't forget him for a long time
He tore the mask off your face
And then put you down
And made you want him
More than anyone before
And then he walked away
And you don't hear from him at all",As the World Rises and Falls,1968

Chasing after your restless heart

Cutting quickly through the dark

Smoke is pouring from my windows
And I'm reaching out my hand
Hoping someone's at my fingertip
That can help me understand

That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow

Hold on, hold on

Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa

Yelling for the sun as the water rises
Feeling like smoke, filling up your eyes
Swinging at a ghost, go and lock that door
Leave that wreckage, let it wash ashore

Go save yourself up, it's a hell of a ride
Feel your heart racing in the middle of the night
Step out of your mind into the wild, wild, wild, wild

That we've all got the sun to follow

Send me all your vampires, 
And I can't get enough, 
And I can't get enough, 
The village church yard is filled with bones weeping in the grave, 
The silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save, 
You want to know how deeply my soul goes, Deeper than bones, 
I want you, 
And I can't get enough. 
After we did it by the window sill, 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky, 
presently in the quilt that your mother made, 
And a candle burns to fight off the gloom, 
I said to live in this way is not for the meek, 
but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek. 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep, 
There will be no regrets when the worms come, 
And they will surely come. 
You do you do, I want you, 
Send me all your vampires, 
I want you

I don't like the way he treats you
He don't deserve you, for real
He really don't
Check this out

What kind of man would leave you standing in the cold?
Must have been a silly one to sacrifice a pot of gold
You're the kind of woman who needs a man that's always there
It's not that you require a lot, just need some tender loving care

[Chorus:]
I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner, too
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover
Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work

Girl, I'll treat you right, and I'll never lie
For all that it's worth
I'll give good love
(Good love, good love, good love)
Good love

It doesn't make sense that you should have a broken heart
Well, if I were the only one, I would never let you fall apart
You're the kind of woman that needs a man with lots of cash
With a stack of major credit cards, and with me you don't have to ask

[Chorus]

Girl, I'll treat you right, and I'll never lie or flirt

No matter what the season is
I still love you with all my heart
I wanna be with you forever, wherever you are

Hey baby, easy, so real
Just for you, because I love you

A summer love is easy but it's just not enough
To satisfy emotions that are shared between us
A winter love is cozy but I need more
It just intensifies my want to have a love that endures

'Cause every time I close my eyes I think of you
No matter what the season is
I still love you with all my heart
I wanna be with you wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right, only you

An autumn love is special at this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone does that love disappear
I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart, my love's lasting

'Cause every time I close my eyes I think of you baby

The Whispers,"People speak your name
And think what a shame you're gone
Still they know
What you've left behind
Lives in our hearts and minds
Today and tomorrow

The clouds of darkness came your way
You've given us a brighter day
And your music will be
So very, very special to me

Sometimes wealth and fame
Whispered, ""Play my game""
But you, yes, you refused to
Genius touched your soul
Fortune not your gold
God's gift is what changed you

A voice like silk would weave your spell
And words of life, oh, only you tell
And your music is gonna be
Very, very special to me

In life's fleeting glance
You have met the chance to give
All they can't
And though short you stayed
Before you went away with them
Now you stand

Listening to your sounds of joy
I think one shot, ghetto boy
And your music will always be
So very, very special to me

Said I love you, Donny
And you're gonna always be
Very, very, very special to me

But you sit idly unaware that I was missing you

Rather just pretend that you're around
Oh my darling, will I see you again?
Rather just pretend that you're around

I got drunk, another fight
It helps me sleep through the night
Well I still stare at your picture every night, when I was kissing you

Fireworks of times we shared
As you sit idly unaware that I was missing you

Oh my darling, will I see you again?
Rather just pretend that you're around
Oh my darling, will I see you again?
I'd rather just pretend that you're around

Spend my days and my nights alone

The White Buffalo,"We were ridin’ out
With our heads in the sky
We were ten and twelve and thirteen
We got BB guns and dirt bikes
And heads full of crowded dreams

We always won
In the hot suburban sun
We were kings of the west side track
These new kids over cross Slater Street
Comin’ on like a heart attack

Mama says
Where are ya going?
And when will you be comin’ home?
With my brother and my memory
I’ll bring my history home

Sealed with piss and with pride
Through the streets we would ride
Over cracks in the dirt and weeds
We’d best be home by suppertime
Just in time to craft a scheme

If you’ve got my back
Here’s the plan of attack
Listen up if you would boys please
We’ll hit these pussies ‘round midnight
And roll off like a band of thieves

Mama says
Where are you going?
And when will you be comin’ home?
With my brother and my memory
I’ll bring my history home

With quiverin’ eyes
And our fear in disguise
We gathered all that would burn in the breeze
We hit the asphalt howlin’ like hellfire
Had no time to get weak in the knees

Under the cover of night
When the timing was right
Like a furious army of three
We’d light up the sky like the fourth of July
And race home like it was a dream

And Mama yells
Where have ya been?
And where the hell are ya comin’ from?

Where we'll crash for the night

Behind us the damage is done, no one can erase
Love has no ending, just a resting place
But there's a place in the dark, in the black where the deals are made
I ain't your partner, I am your slave

Everything will be alright by my side

Forgive me, forgive me, I'm down on my knees
I don't believe that there's a Heaven to go
But I must get this evil out of my bones and my soul
Wash the blood from my hands, but my mind can't get clean
I must flush away what I've done, what I've seen

Well I'll hide when I will, my lament it just grow
My wife and my children, they don't have to know
The fire and the fever I forever fight
I must resist to dance in the devil's delight
Now all I need is a damn way to cope
There's no soap, no hope, no antidote

There's only one way to be free

Called ""Stand By Your Man""

So it's easier to knock 'em all down

""You're really hittin' that ball around""

I could see in his face
White flowers
And cups of coffee
And love letters

I was sorry to interrupt their game
But I went and did it anyway
I dropped my red bowling ball
Through the glass of his machine
I said ""Are you quick enough to hit 
This ball, Mr. Clean?""

You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city

Too sick for breakfast, the car wouldn't start
The train was really full, and his girlfriend had a boyfriend
The houses all the same, now here's the rain
Not falling but collapsing at his feet
Deep breath and he clocks on, raincoat on his arm
He wishes the hours would disappear

But the trip's in vain 'cause awaiting him
A lay-off notice and his severance pay
He shuffles back to the train again

Back home he lies in bed for days and days
Watching American television, smoking
And playing with himself ringing double-O double-5
Into town on Thursday night
The girls are pretty and the lights are bright
At least he loves his city

Holding court on Taylor Square proper was the man he could become
Lear's Fool is a bum now
With seven holy parcels by his side

You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city
You gotta love this city, love this city, you gotta love this city

He walks along the foreshore, he's got a bottle
And he's breathing with his city

It was busy everywhere he went
There was a crowd over the bay
And a fireworks display
It's all very strange for a Thursday night thought he
Then it dawns on him as a cracker explodes
And who the hell is he going to blame?
It dawns on him - the horror - we got the Olympic Games

You gotta love this city for its body and not its brain

And he screams ""My city is a whore, opened herself to the world
Jumped up and down in pastel shirts
And lathered up thinking about designs for T-shirts""

You gotta love this city for its body and not its brain

It's more than he can take, and the stars' reflection breaks
'Cause you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it enjoy the view

People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""

My health is not all that it used to be
My heart is out of beat, I got chokers on my feet
My eyesight's getting dimmer, I can't see

Doctor thanks for seeing me today, I'm glad,
I've got every sickness there is to be had
I had whooping cough last month
And today I've got the mumps
And tomorrow I'll catch chicken pox as well.

[Chorus]
Doctor doctor doctor make me well
I've not got long to go now I can tell
Doctor doctor doctor make me well
I've not got long to go I can tell
I've not got long to go I can tell

Those pills I took have no effect at all
Just the other day I had a nasty fall
And I think I broke my jaw when it hit the kitchen floor
And I'm shrinking last week I was five foot four

I've been getting shivers lately, is it flu?
I know the bug is going round, what can I do?
It's about to pick on me, I've still got the other three
Do you think I caught smallpox I'd get flu?

[Chorus]

Do you think it's time that I made out my will?
I'll leave everything to you to pay my bill
Just how long is there to go
Please tell me I want to know
But on second thoughts don't tell me, I'm too ill.","Doctor, Doctor",1968

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her

Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""

Said ""You're in love""

Said when the next one arrives

I left there in a hurry

The Who,"Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room, and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up the book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be""

The theme of the sermon was 'Come unto me,
And love will find a way',
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be""

She arrived at six, and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said, ""Here we go!""

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage

Soon the atmosphere was cooler
As Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And lept up on the rostrum
She ran across stage to the spotlit figure
And brushed him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be""

Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye, she had to try
But he couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face, oh

Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said
""Don't say I didn't warn you""
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile

Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part

creeps up on me.

He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

And learn all you should know.

Transmit all they know.

That he is your leader
And he is your guide

The Who,"Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room, and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up the book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be""

The theme of the sermon was 'Come unto me,
And love will find a way',
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be""

She arrived at six, and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said, ""Here we go!""

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage

Soon the atmosphere was cooler
As Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And lept up on the rostrum
She ran across stage to the spotlit figure
And brushed him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be""

Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye, she had to try
But he couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face, oh

Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said
""Don't say I didn't warn you""
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile

The Who,"Me and my brother were talking to each other
'Bout what makes a man a man
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand

Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair

So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed

Welcome to my life, tattoo
I'm a man now, thanks to you
I expect I'll regret you but the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die
Tattoo

My dad beat me 'cause mine said ""Mother""
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother
'Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude
And my mother thought that was extremely rude

Welcome to my life, tattoo
We've a long time together, me and you
I expect I'll regret you but the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die

Now I'm older, I'm tattooed all over
My wife is tattooed too
A rooty-toot-toot, rooty-tooty-toot-toot

Riding up in front of a hundred faces

Bell Boy, keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy, carry this baggage out
Bell Boy, always running at someone's pleading heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel

Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks

He's the only soul in the world that's real

You could learn a lot from
A job like mine

Ducked your head under and started to laugh.
What would you do if I shut you outside,
To stand in the rain
and catch cold so you died?

I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs...

And a hundred miles square of land to churn about
My old horse is weary but sincerely
I believe that he can pull a plough
Well I've moved into the jungle of the agriculture rumble,
To grow my own food
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through

Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air

Well, I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn
That stretched as far as the eye can see
That's a whole lot of cornflakes,
Near enough to feed New York till 1973
Cultivation is my station and the nation
Buys my corn from me immediately
And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea

Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging

The right thing to say
Isn't necessarily what you want to say
The right thing to do
Isn't necessarily what you want to do
The right things to grow
Ain't necessarily what you want to grow
Your own happiness
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know

Well I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse
And my hands are deeply grained
Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing
Just how lazily he took the strain
Well my pick and spade are rusty,
Because I'm paid on trust to leave my square of cornfield bare

But the five loaves and the fishes ain't going to be much help,

If the air don't get you too sure as hell the pill will,
Oh, mommy, mommy, please may I go downtown?

Blind to it, as my tears fall again

There's a man going through your dust bin
Only this time he's looking for food
There's a tear in his eye, you don't know him
Oh but you know what he's going through

Ain't it funny that you can't seem to help him
Feelin' sick as he staggers away

I'm home for the weekend
I'm gonna make the most of my time

Giving up his music, gonna take up religion
Deserted rock and roll
To try to save his soul

Playing the electric guitar
Someday I'm gonna make it

And a house for my Ma

You shall play the Carnegie Hall""

To become a heartthrob
I may go far if I smash my guitar

Away for the weekend
I've gotta play some one-night stands
Six for the tax man, and one for the band
Back in the studio to make our latest number one

Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen

When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up
When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge
When the words are immobile until you sit down
Never feel they're worth keeping, they're not easily found
Then you know in some strange, unexplainable way
You must really have something
Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away
Important to say

When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream
And you swear and you curse 'cause the rhyming ain't clean
But it suddenly comes after years of delay
You pick up your guitar, you can suddenly play
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white
Then you can be sure, you can open the door
Get off of the floor tonight
You have something to write

When you want to complain, there's no one can stop you
But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you
You are wearing you heart on your jumping feet
You've got a head start away from the street

But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen

When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it ""with more of a tune""
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed
Then you stick it together and start writing again
And you know that it won't be too long 'til your back
To bring her some money, she's calling you ""honey""
Stashed in a bloody great sack
In your Cadillac

You're alone

Again and again and again

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

You see the man of your dreams
You think his life's full of parties and love
But it's not what it seems
If you could see in his room right now
You'd see how much love is showed
There's never really any romance on the road

His forehead seems cut in two
By the crease in his brown
He chews his nails and he fidgets
Just tryin' to settle on down

Did you see him before?
Did he sign you his name?
Come with me, listenin' at his door
Hear himself so drunk calling home
Can't remember the code
You know, there's never really any romance on the road
Oh no, no, no

He's held some beautiful girls in his arms
But now he clutches his bunk
For all the good that they're doing him now
He might as well be a monk
For his memories ain't worth a thing
Till he's old and he's gone
And his past never quite catches up
The show's movin' on

Did he say he kept a picture
Of a blonde haired girl who'd been kind?
When he was last home, his own daughter
Brought it into his mind
Maybe closing bars and jets
Paid some debts that he owed
But there's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed
On stage for an hour, on a laser beam tower
But you know he slept while the neon glowed
There's never really any romance on the road

There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding

Without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes
And I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud

I am one
And I can see

And I will be

The Who,"You were under the impression
That when you were walking forwards
You'd end up further onward

You were told to not take chances
You missed out on new dances
Now you're losing all your dimples

My jacket's gonna be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet

Strike out to reach a mountain

The Who,"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating
We were the first band to vomit at the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock! I need it every night
Long live rock! Come on and join the line
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock! I need it every night
Long live rock! Come on and join the line
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive

Landslide, rocks are falling, falling down upon our very heads
We tried but you were yawning, look again
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
Rock is dead

The place is really jumping to the high watt amps
'Til a twenty inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they danced right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock
Long live rock

The Who,"Once it was just innocence
Brash ideas and insolence
But you will never get away
With the things you say today

But you can try if you want

Don't you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said
Many many years ago when life appeared rosy red
No one ever shared your bed
Nothing ever filled your head
Except yourself and little Ted
And scary dreams that you were dead.
Don't you want to hide your face
When going through your teenage books
And read the kind of crap you wrote
About ""ban the bomb"" and city crooks
Think about how long it took
To get over that sudden ""Yuk""
When in the mirror you would look
Well now my son you're well in stook

Cry if you want, cry if you want

Didn't you writhe in anger when you saw the man in his big car
Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far
Should have been a famous star
But that ain't what you really are
You could shout your last hurrah

While they are propping up the bar
Maybe things were better then
Before you led a promised life
Rash commitments and heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised
You fall in love with other's wives
Drive 'em nuts with empty lies
Angry 'cause you lost the prize
Forgot the color of their eyes.

Cry if you want, cry if you want

Let your tears flow Let your past go

Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were
Yesterday the day before when you were young with much to learn
Aren't you glad it's your last term
No more acting lowly worm
You can make the suckers squirm
When you tell them how much you earn
Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you keep inside
Does your ego save your face ""I had a go - I really tried""
Now you know your leaders lied
Does it stop you acting snide
Or are you still a boy that cried
Tears now surely long since dried.

Get up early just to watch the sun rise

Every moment has its special charm
It's all right when you're around, rain or shine
I know a crowd who only live after midnight
Their faces always seem so pale

And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight
They say a suntan never fails
I know a man who works the night shift
He's lucky to get a job and some pay

And I like every minute of the day
I dig every second
I can laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet

The pleasure seems to balance out the pain
And so you see that I'm completely crazy
I even shun the south of France
The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy

Now the grownups have all gone away.
You won't be much fun
being blind deaf and dumb
But I've no one to play with today.
D'you know how to play hide and seek?
To find me it would take you a week,
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do to a freak.
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh.
What would you do if I shut you outside,
To stand in the rain
and catch cold so you died?

I'm the school bully 
The classroom cheat.
The nastiest playfriend,
You ever could meet.
I'll stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet

I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs

Away from the sound

Dig to the death
Dig for salvation

Got to find the finds

And you never can catch it up

But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you

I eat an oyster, and I feel the contact

A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feels like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back

You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me

Always running at someone's heel

Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks

A beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real

Well I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days (crazy days, crazy days, crazy days, crazy days)

Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in sixty-three

People often change
But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot from
A job like mine
The secret to me
It ain't flown on a flag
I carry it behind
This pretty little badge
What says

Bell Boy I got to get running now
Bell Boy, keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy, carry the bloody baggage out
Bell Boy, always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel",Bell Boy,1994
The Who,"Some people seem so obsessed with the morning
Get up early just to see the sun rise
Some people like it more when there's fire in the sky
Worship the sun when it's high
Some people go for those sultry evenings
Sipping cocktails in the blue, red and grey

But I like every minute of the day

I like every second, so long as you are on my mind
Every moment has its special charm 
It's alright when you're around, rain or shine

I know a crowd who only live after midnight
Their faces always seem so pale
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight
They say a suntan never fails
I know a man who works the night shift
He's lucky to get a job and some pay

And I like every minute of the day

I dig every second
I can laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain

And so you see that I'm completely crazy 
I even shun the south of France
The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy
But when they sleep, I sing and dance
Some people have to have the sutlry evenings
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey

But I like every minute of the day

I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping

Here comes the yawning demented clown

In your hand you hold your only friend
Never spend your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen

When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up
When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge
When the words are immobile until you sit down
Never feel they're worth keeping, they're not easily found
Then you know in some strange, unexplainable way
You must really have something
Jumping, thumping, fighting, hiding away
Important to say

When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream
And you swear and you curse 'cause the rhyming ain't clean
But it suddenly comes after years of delay
You pick up your guitar, you can suddenly play
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white
Then you can be sure, you can open the door
Get off of the floor tonight
You have something to write

When you want to complain, there's no one can stop you
But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you
You are wearing you heart on your jumping feet
You've got a head start away from the street

But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen

When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it ""with more of a tune""
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed
Then you stick it together and start writing again
And you know that it won't be too long 'til your back
To bring her some money, she's calling you ""honey""
Stashed in a bloody great sack
In your Cadillac

You're alone
You're alone

You're alone above the street somewhere
Wondering how you'll ever count out there

Gas on the hillside, oil in the teacup,
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy,
Distortion becomes somehow pure in it's wildness,
The note that began all can also destroy

We all know success when we all find our own dreams,
And our love is enough to knock down any walls,
And the future's been seen as men try to realize,
The simple secret of the note in us all, in us all

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar,
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star

I have to be careful not to preach
I can't pretend that I can teach,

By pounding stages like a clown.
And on the dance floor broken glass,
The bloody faces slowly pass,
The broken seats in empty rows,
It all belongs to me you know.

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""

I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair

Back to the Rollin' Pin

Eleven hours in the Tin Pan

Where love falls from the trees

There's so many changes and tears you must hide.

Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny,
With hair down to here, and plenty of money,
And just when you think she's that one in the world,
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl,

And then you know you'd better make up your mind.
And pick up on one and leave the other behind.
It's not often easy and not often kind.
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her,
And then you get distracted by her older sister.
When in walks her father and takes you in line,
And says, ""Better go on home, son, and make up your mind.""

And then you bet you'd better finally decide.
And say yes to one and let the other one ride.

A real rider will ride ya, like a stallion with a chair 
Any buster be cherbin', in the game that's embarrassin' 
And we came prepared because I'm round hoe 
On the down low 
And I hit the block with a 50 brown drama metal calico 
From the O to Mexico, we rip shows, gotta let them know 
How we flow, when we get the doe and roll a little harder 
So we smoke a hundered yarder, Bogard, who ridin' Marvin? 
No duckin' and dodgin', my niggas be ridin' 
But we be no gangstas, straight laced parlayers 
You stick around and watch my money lay ya 
And I know them haters, don't want to see you excel 
On the way to Bogel, but them busters always bumpin' 
They gun with a story to tell, fresh off the press 
Hittin' hard like a tech on the target 
Scratching ""Just grab the mic, ? don't do it right.""

What good is a beautiful dame, with a Royals Royce frame 
And a Volkswagen brain

Bustin' shit off like talk is cheap like Rally's burgers

With the Cold 4-0, I really don't like to promote guns 
But I got one, a pistol grip shot gun 
My other one weighs a ton, son, kid, loc, dog, whatever 
Fuckin' with the Likwit will get your head severed 
WhoRidas get it poppin' lik Buggalo shrimp, we got a perment job

We stay on the road, I gtta make my fetti even if it's off the wall 
Gotta stay on the ball, my gift to gab, make a lotta cash 
Sit back in a lab and strike oil like an Arab 
For sheeze, I know my brown preeza, oh Jesus

So many niggas ou there trying to be the man

While I get into this style that bones like M 3's 
Cause I'm here to clock cheese, my style is mega costly 
Even Oakland niggas ay ""Tash is hella saucy"" (What!) 
I stomp out the cop out, no ties or split deciesions

But even half blind, I still find a rhyme to blow your mind 
That's why I walk around L.A. with more hoes than Ginuwine 
So jump in the saddle if y'all niggas want to battle 
Cause I roll shake and rattle till your whole crew skidattle

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife

And I'm back here on the wild side of life

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다

Need a kickstart cocktail, ten percent coffee
With a high rise family size, guaranteed to catonize

I need a double take, a-just to get awake
To try and counteract the hollow feeling nature makes
It's gonna work a treat, gonna get me on my feet
It's a teasing little tonic with a kick like a mule and a skip on the beat

It ain't right, it ain't wrong, I need a bomb, I need a caffeine bomb
Too sweet, a-too strong, I need a bomb, I need a caffeine bomb

Well it's a case of easy come and easy go
I need a caffeine bomb to wake me in the morning
I need a caffeine bomb to get me to the show
Oh no, I think I'm gonna throw (bleurgh!)

Her silence is refreshing and her honesty is bliss
She's probably clairvoyant but she never had the call
But that's not long at all

The good guys think she's different the rest just think she's weird
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep, she's thinking all the while

And maybe you're the angel I knew that you could be
Well that must be the reason you bring out the devil in me
Deep under the covers, an easy place to hide

I guess I'm set for the night and anti-social, to keep in shape, thin and white

I light a smoke, and in'tween tokes, consult the TV guide
The bible for the pig who stays inside

CHORUS

Thinning, I'm thinning and insanely grinning
And fools peering
Out of my TV try hard to be funny
Unfortunate for me
They start to entertain ye

I'm living on a land-mine, the kind that never ignites
And I'm here waiting, here for nothing...

CHORUS",TV Tan,1993
The Wildhearts,"(right hand [to left hand])

and of all the feelings
It's the only choice that my senses make, it's like I could inject you, babe, aa-aa
And of all the faces, you're the only human I ever known
But ain't it good to be alone sometimes?

it's warmer than blood and stronger than bone, I scratch and I shake

CHORUS:
I'm Jonesing for Jones, streams on my pillow, whether I can sleep at last
I'm Jonesing for Jones, say goodbye to the past


Uh-oh

and in the blackest evening
A-just a taste of you and the heavens shine, light enough to daze the blind, aaaw
You've got the power to fix me when I'm sick and twisting from time I've known
But ain't it good to feel alone sometimes?

it's warmer than blood and stronger than bone, I scratch and I shake

CHORUS
To the past (x2)

oo-oo-oo oo-oo-ooo

I'm feeling warm and sated, a little dehydrated
But that's okay, a-'cause there's nothing in the way this time

it rains when I'm dry, it speaks when I'm alone, I can't leave it - I've tried

CHORUS
To the past (x6)

The Wildhearts,"The lights are on
The ships have gone
I''m fine and dry and much to my relief

I''m flying high
To beat the sky
And One by One my blues lie underneath

A time to live
A time to die
A time to open up your eyes and see

I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world

Why waste time
To find the place
When all the time the world was mine to keep

A time to live
A time to die
A time to open up your eyes and see

Rocks and stones
and breaking bones
The fits, the shakes, he tries to get some sleep

I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world

Hold your breath
And count to ten
So good to be so fucked up... oh yeah!

I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world
I''m in love with the rock ''n'' roll world

The Wildhearts,"I've been on tenterhooks
ending in dirty looks,
list'ning to the Muzak,
thinking 'bout this 'n' that.
She said that's that.
I don't wanna chitter-chat.
Turn it down a little bit
or turn it down flat.

Pump it up when you don't really need it.
Pump it up until you can feel it.

Down in the pleasure centre,
hell bent or heaven sent,
listen to the propaganda,
listen to the latest slander.
There's nothing underhand
that she wouldn't understand.

Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.

She's been a bad girl.
She's like a chemical.
Though you try to stop it,
she's like a narcotic.
You wanna torture her.
You wanna talk to her.
All the things you bought for her,
putting up your temp'rature.

Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.

Out in the fashion show,
down in the bargain bin,
you put your passion out
under the pressure pin.
Fall into submission,
hit-and-run transmission.
No use wishing now for any other sin.

Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.

The Wildhearts,"It's only love
That keeps you going when you're far away
It's only love
And it keeps on growing
Deeper every day

It's only love that makes the world go 'round
And when you're feeling down
It picks you up, and gives you all the strength you're needing
Still you're feeling
Still believe in love

Its making you feel it
Only love, that's making you need it
Only love that's making you feel that you believe it
And a lifetime ain't enough

It's only love
That makes a bridge that closes up the miles
It's only love
That'll leave you feeling helpless as a child

It's only love that makes the world go 'round
And makes you glad you found a reason enough
To keep you going, keep believing
Keep you in the light you feel in love

Its making you feel it
Only love, that's making you need it
Only love that's making you feel that you believe it
And a lifetime ain't enough",Only Love,2003
