Bonez MC,"Peng peng

Dicka, komm mir nicht mit wir sind nicht real
Ich kacke auf die Patte, die sie machen, denn ich lebe für die Sachen
Sie verkaufen ihre Werte für paar Cent in der Tasche
Doch ich habe lieber Klasse als die Ratten hinter mir
Endgegnerlevel in dem ewigen Spiel, schieben Hass, weil die Luft nicht reicht
Der Druck sie zerreibt wie die Reifen den Qualm unter meinem brandneuen SUV
Wir sind noch lange, lange nicht am Ziel, alles schon zu weit, weit weg von ihnen
Glaube mir, niemand kann mir nehmen, was meine eigenen Hände aufbauen, denn ich bleib' hier
Wie aus Kevlar, jede Narbe, die wir tragen, macht den Körper zu Granit
Und jedes Lüftchen, das du Gegenwind nennst, meinen Kampfgeist motiviert
Hau mir lieber ab, aber ganz bei mir, meine Blicke durchdringen den Rauch von dem Hazejoint
Egal, ob du angreifst oder wieder wegläufst, merk dir, man hat dich im Visier!
Stehst im Weg genau bei den Falschen, zwischen mir und meinem Ziel
Stell dich auf direkt zu dem ander'n und dann friss mein Magazin! 

So viele von ihnen sind plem plem plem
Ziehen dich in den Dreck, Dreck, Dreck
Nur weil sie nicht gönnen, gönnen, gönnen
Doch wir haben die Antwort, die jeder versteht
Und die geht peng peng peng
Reih sie auf, einer nach dem anderen und es macht 
Peng peng peng, ey!

Ey!
Gib mir ein'n Pullup, Pullup
Ich wiederhole dir noch einmal diese Message
Was wollen diese hundert, hundert MCs?
Nie ohne mein Team ist unser Package
Kontra, Kontra kennt kein Limit, alle sind wir Profis
Gestern verkaufen wir unsern Fans einen Jibbit
Komm mit auf einen Trip, wir sind weg last-minute
Wenn das steuerfreie Para in der S-Class drin ist
Mein Dick ist fame
Chays wollen ihn inhalieren wie 'caine
Die Brüder vom Balkan sind dankbar, denn ich brachte ganz West-Wien ins Game
Cørbo-raben-camouflage auf meinem Hemd
Armanibrille sitzt, setz' 'n Filter auf die Welt, ahh
In Sachen Beef keine Akzeptanz
Bist du Freund von meinem Feind, Junge, bleib mir auf Distanz
Kontra bleibt ein Bruder, sie haben Angst
Denn sie fürchten alle unsre Allianz, ah

So viele von ihnen sind plem plem plem
Ziehen dich in den Dreck, Dreck, Dreck

Wir rollen den Benz, Benz, Benz und wegen den Fans, Fans, Fans
Mir geht es so blendend, denn die Felgen, sie glänzen, -zen, -zen
Zentrale der Polizei wird alarmiert
Wurde Zeit, dass hier mal wieder was passiert
Kleiner Cut, ratzfatz repariert
Und seine äußerliche Mängel retuschiert
Ich bin dein Freund, hör auf zu hassen, komm und trink von mei'm Glas!
Wenn wir den Club verlassen, heißt es, King Kong war da
Frauen sind so vergesslich, fühlten sich gestern noch belästigst
Heute wollen die Schlampen alle ein Kind von mir haben
T-rex unterm Arsch bei einunddreißig Grad
Nackensteak auf Nacken des schwulen Besitzers, weil er mich mag
So läuft es ab jetzt jeden Tag
Hab' in Deutschland den besten Vertrag
Digga, kipp ma' Champagner auf all diese Fotzen
Ich hab' für die Scheiße bezahlt

So viele von ihnen sind plem plem plem
Ziehen dich in den Dreck, Dreck, Dreck

Bonez MC,"Die Taschen voll mit Geld wegen Kokain
Das Taxi wird bestellt, sie haben Bock zu ziehen
Meine ganze Stadt betäubt von dem glänzenden Zeug
Hotpants werden feucht, komm und kauf was von mir
Flieg' auf die Bahamas wegen Kokain
Liegen flach im Wasser wie ein Krokodil
Jeder hier ist Freund von dem glänzenden Zeug
Neuer Benz, neues Gold, dafür braucht man Papier

Kiefer taub, sie kommen raus aus der Matrix
Brille auf, denn die Augen sind Smarties
Wird verkauft, doch verbraucht wird hier gar nix
Mach' Cash mit dem Team, geb' es aus im Atramis
Gib den Joint, denn er riecht nach Amnesia
Sonne bräunt, bin trainiert wie Vegeta
Fünfhaus, bin in meiner Favela
Sie tanzt für ein Gramm Macarena
Ja, sie macht alles für mich
Hauptsache, ich packe Natz auf den Tisch
Einmal und sie strahlt übers ganze Gesicht
Hab' sie analysiert, alles Mathematik, jaja

Was für eine Party, Geldregen fällt
Steh' vor meinem Spiegelbild und wichse auf mich selbst
Will Ferraris, schwarz, rot und in gelb
Kokaina satt statt Brot für die Welt, ey
Also warum kompliziert? Es kann auch einfach laufen
Deine Frau, sie kommt zu mir, weil sie will Steine rauchen
Hab' sie alle so fixiert wie aufm Scheiterhaufen
Immer nur so viel, dass keiner stirbt, sie sollen weiter kaufen
Bin ich da, fangen die Junkies an zu schwitzen
Und ist mir scheißegal, wenn sie anfangen, sich zu spritzen
Bunker' fünfzig Kugeln in der Bauchtasche drin
Bin wieder mal nur aus auf Gewinn, ja

Die Taschen voll mit Geld wegen Kokain
Das Taxi wird bestellt, sie haben Bock zu ziehen

Jeder hier ist Freund von dem glänzenden Zeug
Neuer Benz, neues Gold, dafür braucht man Papier

Sie fragen, „Gzuz, Digga, hast du das nötig?“ (ja)
Denk mir so, „Nö, aber das Natz ist so ölig“ (ja)
Mache weiter Schnapp, weil sie schnappen mich eh nicht (nein)
Stapel' so viel Batzen wie möglich (ja)
Eins, zwei, drei Dinger Flex (ja)
Sie zahlen für ein ganzes, doch kriegen 0,6 (haha)
Direkt hier vom Hafen und niemals gestreckt (niemals)
Mein Handy schon wieder besetzt (brrt)

Bei allem, was ich tue, gebe hundert
Ganz nach oben, nein, ich geh' nicht unter
Läuft bei mir, nicht dass es euch wundert
Ich hab' keine Zeit, ich habe Hunger
Bei allem, was ich tue, gebe hundert
Zu lange außen vor, jetzt geb' ich hundert
Alles jetzt, bestes Herb wird gebunkert

Es ist gut, genau so wie es ist
All das keine Show, das bin ich
Mache Kohle, doch Kohle nicht mich
Mein Style, mein Style immer frisch

Alles so wie immer und es ballert
Gute Arbeit, Hip-Bag immer praller
Verrate meine Leute nie, du Knaller
Nicht für Franken, Euro oder Dollar
So wie Philipp Lahm Michael Ballack
Schreibe schwarze Zahlen im Namen aller
Bankerfrauen lächeln jetzt am Schalter
Eh-heh, denken, ich wär' Profi-Fußballer
Rubel rollt, alles läuft rund
Um mich rum alles gesund
Mach' Mula nicht zum Mittelpunkt
Warum aufhören? Sehe keinen Grund
Alle wollen von unten nach ganz oben
Hol' mir, was ich will, mit den Noten
Sommer Kreuzberg, Winter Tropen
Mit beiden NMDs auf'm Boden

Mein Style, mein Style immer frisch

Schicke Nikes, mein Style immer frisch
Ziemlich geiler Vibe hier, das Eis ist für dich
Sitze auf der Bank, die Sonne scheint ins Gesicht
Wär' mal wieder an der Zeit für einen Spliff, nah
Lass' mich tätowieren, weil ich hab' nix zu tun
Fahre in die Stadt und kauf' für alle Geschenke
Wie sie es lieben, wenn ich Michael Jackson sing'
Sie wackeln mit den Backen und ich stotter'
Super hacke, also mach' ich den Roboter
Komm, wir packen ein paar Sachen in den Koffer
Blacka, blacka, Makarow, Kalashnikowa
Wir ficken einfach auf Toilette, ihre Nummer auf dem Zettel
Ich schwör', ich ruf' dich morgen an

Alles gut, genau so wie es ist
Alles echt, mach' es so, halt' es schlicht
Mache Kohle, doch Kohle nicht mich
Mein Style, mein Style immer frisch
Es ist gut, genau so wie es ist
All das, keine Show, das bin ich
Mache Kohle, doch Kohle nicht mich
Mein Style, mein Style immer frisch

Zu viel los, in Berlin ist Fiesta
Hör' die Touristen-Party durch mein Fenster
Will nach Málaga Strand, brauch' Siesta
Allein mit dem Dreizack am Lenker
Chill' mit Eis an der Costa, Puta
Camora ist kein Popstar, Bruder
Es war bitter, aber Gott gab Zucker
Hab' jetzt Fans selbst in Ost-Europa
Hab' mein Leben prophezeit in den Songs
Es geht auf, wenn die Zeit dafür kommt
Alles läuft genau so, wie es soll
Rosé-grünes Ziffernblatt, Roli aus Gold, ey
Video, flieg' in fünf Tagen um Planet
Studio, denn bei allem geb' ich hundertzehn
Und sollt' ich eines Tages untergehen
Sag es allen: RAF Camora hat seinen Wunsch gelebt!

Hab' scharfe Waffen überall, Digga, bin immer ready
Weil jeder Hurensohn will wissen, was dahinter steckt
Du findest Opiate scheiße, ich bin high
Deine Frau leckt zwischen Arsch und Eier, weil ich find' das geil (ja)
Was für ein Dissen? Willst du streiten, dann fliegt Blei
War nie Teil von deiner Szene und da bleib' ich auch dabei
Seht es ein, es ist vorbei
Bin im Studio so gangster, doch zerreißen dich auch live
Und nein, es war kein Hype, wir gehen noch dreimal auf die Eins
Auf einmal kommt ihr und wollt reden, ich hab' leider keine Zeit (nah)

Jeden Tag besoffen, doch Geschäfte laufen top
Ich hab' keine Zeit zu kochen, schnelles Essen aus der Box
Letzte Nacht gekotzt wegen sechsundsechzig Shots
Weil die 187 Strassenbande kennt kein Stop

Tausende Probleme seit letzter Nacht
War wohl wieder in der Stadt und hab' Stress gemacht
Dachte, ich hab' tief geschlafen, aber Pech gehabt
Vielleicht stecken sie mich jetzt in Knast
Tausende Probleme seit letzter Nacht
Hab' den Cheftürsteher einfach weggeklatscht
Alle sagen, „der ist krass, du hast Pech gehabt“
Vielleicht stechen sie mich jetzt auch ab",Letzte Nacht [Instrumental] [Instrumental],2018

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand, it's always there

Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

I'm going all the way

Just let go, forget the world around us

Burning deep inside

In television view
Seems like that's my only friend
When I'm away from you

Yeah, we had another fight
About the other flame
Now you claim the candle died

You say I'm the only one
Now that just suits me fine
You better treat me good
'Cause I'm forgiving you this time

I'm sleeping all alone
Tell me you're coming home
I'm sleeping all alone - tonight

If I had a half a mind
I'd kick you out the door
And if I were an other guy
I'd even up the score

But you see I love you
And a body has a will
So please don't knock me in the heart
I hope you had your thrill

You know that you made mistakes
And me I made some too
So hurry home and ask me
If I'm - television blue

I felt strong enough
To play a tough man's game
Quit chasing after love

Bonfire,"Dreamin' by the fire 
At the Gulf of Mexico 
Somebody's playin' a lovesong 
With a six string homesick tone

Memories of summer 
The first time we made love 
And a promise left unspoken 
I saw in a shooting star 

The Southern wind was blowin' 
As if he wants to say 
The words I whispered in my hear
Only yesterday 

You're my only one - my risin' sun 
You're the air I want to breathe 
Girl you're everything I need 
My shining star - that's what you are 
And as long my heart will beat 
You'll be everything - everything I need 

The fire is still burning
I was humming to the song 
Couldn't think of all the words 
So I made them up my own

Like a secret door that opens 
These words just set me free 
And the promise left unspoken
Was the owner of the key 

Oh Southern wind keep blowin' 
Please carry me back home 
There's somebody who is waiting 
And I've gotta let her know 

You're my only one - my risin' sun 
You're the air I want to breathe 
Girl you're everything I need 
My shining star - that's what you are 
And as long my heart will beat 
You'll be everything - everything I need

They might even bring some rain 
But the promise left unspoken 
Will always be the same",Southern Winds,2001

the others were the good guys - I was German - I was bad

proud of Germany

Well, I made this trip to Vegas - with a friend of mine
some people heard we're German - and they called us ""Nazi swines""

so tell me how long - will this be going on

Sorta like Dre with the headphone thing
You could be whatever you want nigga, we all kings

I had a dream last night, I was rich Porter
Then I had a dream I had a bitch like Kim Porter
Then I had a dream I had bricks like transporter
Change my life like Steph Curry in the fourth quarter
What if you drove by a playground and witness
Michael Jordan taking off for his first dunk
bet you wish you had your camcorder
That's the type of shit I'm made of
That's the type of shit I'm made of

I used to wish that I was 2Pac

Is we up in the Bay bruh?

Bonnie Hearne,"I gave up the fast lane for a

about the motherlode.

Down along the river
and past the swimming hole

for miles and miles on end
and never stop believin' in
that dream around the bend.

There's really nothin' much to do
until the first spring thaw.

I must have gone insane.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Do I feel you disappear?
Am I crying?
Am I dreaming?
Will I wake up years ago?
Am I dying?

When the sky was still blue
I was welcomed and loved, not alone
Not alone

And I remember, so long ago
When it still felt so good

Have my way with you

I'm a child
I am starving
I am eating from your hands
Feed me fiction

Well I remember, so long ago
When we met, I was new
And you told me the truth sets you free
Yes you did

And I remember so long ago
When the green in your eyes
Set off something inside me that burns
Feel it burning
Way down inside

On that beautiful night
I watched you while you slept
Through my warm, purple high
In the green grass
Where I held you, and I wept
In the green grass where I wept
Way down inside

I remember, so long ago
When you said not a word
But I know that I heard your goodbye
Yes I did

And I remember so long ago
When I knew you were gone
But your love lingered on through the years
I still love you
Way down inside

Would the moon forget the tide?
Would the soul forget to die?
Would the wind forget to sigh?

Bonnie Owens,"Way out in Reno Nevada
Where romance blooms and fades
A great Philadelphia lawyer
Was in love with a Hollywood maid

""Come love and we will wander out
Where the lights are bright
I'll win you a divorce from your husband
And we can get married tonight""

Now Bill was a gun totin' cowboy
Ten notches were carved on his gun
And all the boys around Reno
Left wild Bill's maiden alone

One night when he was returning
From riding the range in the cold
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart
Her love was as lasting as gold

As he drew near her window
A shadow he saw on the shade
The great Philadelphia lawyer
Was making love with Bill's Hollywood maid

The night was as still as the desert
The moon was bright overhead
Bill listened awhile to the lawyer
He could hear every word that he said

""Your hands are so pretty and lovely
Your form's so rare and divine
Come go with me to the city
We'll leave this wild cowboy behind""

Now back in old Pennsylvania
Among the beautiful pines
There's one less Philadelphia lawyer
In old Philadelphia tonight",Philadelphia Lawyer,

WITH BONNIE OWENS
(Jack Rhodes - Don Carter)
Â« Â© '64 Central Songs, BMI Â»

Too used to that certain someone to offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one too used to being with you
Some other's arms may hold and caress you
Some other's lips may burn on my own
That's why your eyes are filled with their beauty
My heart inside will be crying alone
Too used to that certain someone...
When you find a true love you treasure
Other offers are just the past time
You'll find their love just a cheap imitation
The love they offer's not real genuine
Too used to that certain someone...
Too used to being with you

Two eyes that shine so bright
Two lips that kiss goodnight

Because I love him so

He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee

Upon his pillow so white
I pray the Lord above
To guide him safe through the night

In dreams I see his face
And feel his fond embrace
There's no one can replace

And you say you love me but you want to know dear if I've been untrue to you
Yes I love you only and I've been so lonely dear I've waited for so long
No there's been no other for no one could ever make me feel the way you do

",Yes I Love You Only,1969
Bonnie Owens,"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by

When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from that home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in all his glory we'll understand it all by and by

Then like a blind man when God gave back his sights 
Praise the Lord I saw the light

[Chorus]
I saw the light I saw the light no more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight praise the Lord I saw the light

Wanderin' through life so aimless and sinned I wouldn't let my Savior dear in

Praise the Lord I saw the light

Bonnie Owens,"I dreamed mama walked up the heavenly stairs
And medals for mothers were given up there
They mentioned the million things mom did for me
Things I took for granted and never could see
If there's medals for mothers for all of the deeds they have done
If there's medals for mothers mama you'll win everyone
[ guitar ]
A medal of honor was pinned on her there a medal for patience and kind loving care
A medal for duty she won up above but the biggest of all was the one for her love
If there's medals...

Bonnie Owens,"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we bear

Have we trials and temptations is there trouble anywhere
If we have don't be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit",What a Friend We Have in Jesus,1970
Bonnie Owens,"I have heard of a land on a faraway strand this beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high there we never shall die in the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old never grow old in the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old never grow old in the land where we'll never grow old
[ dobro ]
When our work here is done and our life's crown is won
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before
Never grow old never grow old...




",Where We'll Never Grow Old,1970
Bonnie Owens,"Now tell me where could I go but to the Lord
Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation sore where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul

Needing a friend to help me in the end (now tell me) where could I go but to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face the chilling hand of death where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go
Where could I go",Where Could I Go But to the Lord,1971
Bonnie Owens,"Just between the two of us, we know our love is gone
People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me you trust me anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care

Just between the two of us, let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us, we know our love is gone

Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love, no anything, there's nothing left at all

Just between the two of us, let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree

But just between the two of us, we know our love is gone",Just Between the Two of Us,1995
Bonnie Owens,"Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll receive such peace and happiness

But wait a little longer please Jesus there are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in

Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost dear ol' Lord then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say

Wait a little longer please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in",Wait a Little Longer Please Jesus,1995

買えないものが欲しいんだ Happy Birthday!

You'll never fool her, you're bound to let it show

Everything in return, you just preserve her
When you serve her a little tenderness

If she's a woman, she'll try to make it last
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast
There's no reason here, no treason here
Just the way a woman's mind, well she has no name
She has no shame, she just loves you

Or to speak too freely to just anyone

Walk so proud when you're comin' on

I'm wonderin' how I ever got through my life without you
Days passed me by and left my life somewhere behind
Games I was trying left me old before my time

You came into my life almost like you knew
The time was running out I came running home with you
You taught me how to love you
You helped me to believe
You could even love me
I was all you'd ever need

Sometimes when you're sleepin'
I wonder if its true
I'm afraid they'll come and take away this precious dream with you
Then you wake and hold me and love me through the night
Then I'll know that somehow everything will be alright

And felt you close and warm beside me
Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache
And the memory of you inside me

Darling, I've never been so blue
I've tried to see it through, there's nothing I can do
I won't make it on my own, so won't you please hurry home
'Cause nothing seems to matter without you

Last time I saw you, there was nothing we could say
We knew it was a time for a change
A time to think you said that night and I lied and said, ""All right""
And I left you in the morning, I watched you in the window
And Mexico will never be the same

It was time to be apart, but somehow it seems this heart of mine
Will never find a way to live without you
And now I'm out here on the road and I'm feeling bought and sold
And tonight I just can't but think about you

Darling, I've never been so blue
I've tried to see it through, there's nothing I can do
I won't make it on my own, so darling won't you hurry home
Because nothing seems to matter without you
No, nothing seems to matter without you

No, baby, no, that ain't the way how.

You got to take your time, you know it ain't no crime

That you're doin' right.

When we finally know how,

Told me baby
I was still too young to know
All the ways that love was going
To drag you down and just how low I'd go

In love and time between us
Makes no difference at all
You know, you're as desperate to get back up
As I am not to fall

Oh, baby, I've been looking for a man like you
Oh, darling, after all we've been through
There's no one left to fool, nothing left for us to do
Except me and you

Told me baby
To find somebody new
Do you really think that I'd come this far
Just to lose a man like you?

You know you've got to take a chance
If only you will stay
And if you've got the time baby, I've got the love

I've got you on my mind, I'm feeling kind of sad and low,
I've got you on my mind, feeling kind of sad and low.
I'm wondering where you are, wondering why yoiu had to go.

Tears begin to fall every time I hearr your name.
Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name.
And since you went away, nothing seems to be the same.

No matter how I try,
My heart just don't see why
I can't forget you.
If ever it shoud be
You want to come back to me,
You know I'd let you.

All you wanted from the start was to cry

It looks like another fall
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all
When you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man

It does you no good to pretend child
You've made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like you lose again, my friend
Call on your rainy day man

Now rainy day man he don't like sunshine
He don't chase rainbows
He don't need good times
Grey days rolling
Then you'll see him
Empty feeling
Now you need him

All those noble thoughts they just don't belong
You can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just look up your rainy day man

Now simple pleasures they all evade you
Store-bought treasures none can save you
Look for signs to ease the pain
Ask again
Go on and pray for rain

And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear

You were playing on the guitar strings

You were playing like the devil wearing wings
Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings
Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?

Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky
I followed through a sideshow to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice

And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice
Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in

Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?
Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
The man calls out the numbers...he sometimes mentions mine

But I feel like I've been working overtime

They'd always put her down below their kind

Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind

There's a train every day
Leading either way
There's a world you know
There's a way to go
I soon believe it's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawings left there on the table
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor
I would keep them here if I were able
To lock you safe behind it's open door

Suddenly it's so clear to me
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see
Now my kind words find their way back to me

There's a train every day
Leading either way

Got a way to go

Sweet Forgiveness
How could go my babe
I never really knew how I needed you, but you were right there
(I don't know the rest)

Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me.
When you hold me close,
And you say, ""That's all over.""
You don't go looking back,
You don't hold the cards to stack.
Cause you mean what you say.

Sweet forgiveness, you help me see.
I'm not near as bad,
As I sometimes appear to be.
When you hold me close,
And you say, ""That's all over,
""And I still love you.""

There's no way that I could make up,
For those angry words I said.
Sometimes it gets to hurting,
And the pain goes to my head.

Sweet forgiveness, dear God above.
I say we all deserve,
A taste of this kind of love.
Someone who'll hold our hand,
And whisper, ""I understand,
""And I still love you.""",Sweet Forgiveness,1977

I'm takin' my time
So please don't rush me.
Tryin' to sort out some things I didn't know existed.
I've been here before,
I know where the traps lie.
You only take what's there 'cause the rest doesn't matter.

Well I'm tired of talk,
So please don't push me.
You know I want the same kinda things that you do.
You're wasting your time,
The way you come to me.
Slow down your rhymes and try to reason

Can't make things move any faster,
By second wishing them to death.
You seem to be living on the level.
It's decent enough,
You got what you wanted.
So why do you tell me, that I'm on the wrong track?
I'm doin' the best I can do.

I try to out guess
The situation
That I know your not even fully aware of.
And I want you to know,

Can't keep on letting you bring me down.
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.

Bonnie Raitt,"A friend of mine she cries at night
And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes 
And she wants one of her own
She's waited long enough she says 
And still she can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose and it tears her up inside
She's scared, scared she'll run out of time

I see my folks, they're getting old
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange
No matter how you tell yourself 
It's what we all go through
Those eyes are pretty hard to take
When they're staring' back at you

Scared to run out of time

When did the choices get so hard?
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to waste

Scared to run out of time

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid
You came along and showed me
How to leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again 
And then much to my surprise

She's alone in this world
She's nobody's girl
She's nobody's girl

She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night
Then she disappears for weeks at a time

With anyone, you know, she wants it all

Bonnie Raitt,"Yes, I'm lonely- hope you didn't catch it
Don't want to be down where I last behaved
I broke his heart now I can't patch it
This time it's grave.

I kept track of all the love that I gave him
And on paper, well, it looked pretty good
He left a note that said he couldn't stay here
As if I could

I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.

One of these days I thought we'd get it together
After all that boy was made for me
But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers
Little bird got free.

He always said my love was one sided
I tried to keep up with supply and demand
But there was one way that pie was divided
It was a big piece plan.

I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.

Well, now I'm getting desperate, baby, getting illegal
I got the law doggies on my trail
The hawk's out and I could use an eagle
To go my bail.

But if it jumps off, don't look at me

Bonnie Raitt,"I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin' that I wasn't the only one
The lonely one

One chance intervention, see what it can signify
The slightest misapprehension, baby
And we'd have passed each other by
When I heard your sweet voice callin'
Saw your light come shinin' through
I couldn't stop my heart from turning
Churnin' out my love for you

I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin' that I wasn't the only one
That lonely one

True love or perfection
It seems like it's overdue
Then just when you least expect it
It comes sneakin' up on you
When I thought that I was dreaming
Felt your body close to mine
Now love takes on a different meaning
Together till the end of time

I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one
When I saw your face, through the web of my confusion
Whisperin' that I was not the only one

Bonnie Raitt,"When he looks into her eyes
He sees only the truth
Telling him he's been living a lie
over and over like a line in a song
About all the love he let pass by.

To her he might be the man of her dreams
To find where she's been hiding inside
Broken or battered, it really doesn't matter
Her heart's like a wave and he's the tide.

They're not forever they're just for today
One part be my lover, one part go away.

He's like a boxer who had to retire
After winning but killing a man
He's got all the moves and none of the courage
Afraid to throw a punch that might land.

Not too much later she can't meet his glance
You see her start pulling away
Over and over like fire and ice
One is color, one is grey.

They're not forever, they're just for today
One part be my lover, one part go away.

So if you know how 
Why don't you say'em a prayer
They're need all the help they can get
They remember too much about what went wrong
It might be they should learn to forget.

Forget themselves in each other
And leave what belongs in the past
Carry their hearts like a newborn child
Cause it's only the moment that lasts.

Go on to work in the morning
To come home in the evening
And have nothing to say

Bet you're wonderin' where I am,
Rang that number all night long,
Got no comfort on the telephone,
Went out and caught me a midnight flight,
Thought a little love would make it all alright,
But the landlord said you moved away and left me all of your bills to pay,
Look out baby I think you might have made your move too soon.

He left me with a Keno card, livin' in Vegas ain't too hard,
I ran it up to about 50 grand, counted it out and held it in my hand,
That kinda word will get around, and make a lost love come up found,
I hear ya knockin' baby at my door, but you don't live here no more,
Oh no, I think he made his move too soon.

I've been from Spain to Tokyo, from Africa to Ohio,
I never try to make the news, I'm just a man who sings those low down blues,

And how low I've felt so long.
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along,
And change my life the way you've done.

And how long I've waited for your touch.

Jackson:
When I was a young man I'd never been kissed;
I got to thinking about what I had missed.
I found a girl. I kissed her and then...
Oh lord, I kissed her again.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Bonnie:
He asked me to marry and be his sweet wife;
We would be happy -- all of our life.
He begged and he pleaded like a natural man, and then...
Oh lord, I gave him my hand.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Jackson:
I worked mighty hard and so did my wife;
Working hand in hand to make a good life.
Corn in the field and wheat in the bins, and then...
Oh lord, I was the father of twins.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Bonnie:
Our children numbered just about four
And they all had sweethearts knocking on the door.
They all got married and they didn't wait, I was...
Oh lord! a grandmother of eight!

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

Jackson:
Now we are old and ready to go
Thinking about what happened a long time ago.

Bonnie:
We had lots of kids and trouble and pain, but...
Oh lord, we'd do it again.

Together:
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...
Oooooh, kisses sweeter than wine.
Oooooh, kisses...

South of the border down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
Now as I wander my thoughts ever stray south of the border down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
And for a tender while I kissed the smile opon her face
For it was Fiesta we were so gay south of the border down Mexico way
And she smiled and she whispered Manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied and I whispered Manana for our tomorrow never came
South of the border I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
And the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border down Mexico way

Well, I went and gave away my TV
Told the man, ""Cut off the phone""
I put an ad in the paper, baby, gonna sell everything I own
Done everything in the world I know, to try to make it through
But there's just no getting over you

Well, I went and bought myself a new straw hat
One eye pokin' under the brim, I bought myself a little seaside shack
In case I might just want to swim
Done everything I know in the world to try to shake these blues
But there's just no getting over you

Well, I try and try but honey it ain't no use
Cry and cry, I just can't turn you loose
Why oh why, can't I get you off my mind?
You got that hook so far in baby, I gotta get you off my line

Well, I got some transcendental meditation, baby
And I'm taking up Japanese, I signed up at the cooking school
I'm going to pick up on some hard cuisine
Done everything in the world I know, to try to make it through
But there's just no getting over you

Honey I, I tried and I tried baby it ain't no use
Cried and I cried but I just can't turn you loose

It's an unintended consequence of love

Now baby, I'm the one that's taking chances
I know we've got a love worth fighting for
Let's drop them petty games and pick up dancing
Get back to where we're wanting nothing more

I'm calling on you, baby, now or never
Let's dig in deep and get out of this rut
We'll get back to what brought us both together, baby
And find a way to resurrect our strut

When the cold wind blows right through you
And you said it ain't no fun
You called west a dream come true

Then one week it got the best of you
On a path lying in that Oklahoma sun
Swore if this day ever came
There'd be no strings, no playing games

Misty eyes and sad goodbyes to say
When love is gone why try to put
A finger on what happened
When somewhere down the road

It slipped away
All I ever wanted was a baby in my arms
A wedding ring and a simple thing called home
All you ever gave me was a look at some old highway

The sky above and the love of a rolling stone
I remember when you told me
That you'd always be a drifting man
And you didn't need another hungry mouth to feed

And I won't bring a child into a world between roses
And a thorn and the side of a tumbling tumbleweed
One day you may miss me
But I hope you don't feel guilty

Go chase the sun until your dying day
But inside me there's a second little heartbeat
That goes with me
And the one more thing that happened on the way

They're looking for someone to share
The excitement of a love affair
Just as soon as they find you
They wine you and dine you
You fly on the wings of romance
But in the eyes of the world
You're just another crazy girl
Who loves a married man
Oh your love is a secret
And you've got to keep it
As long as you can
No don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
The world is full of married men
Oh yeah you make him feel so young
But his wife will still be number one
He promises to marry you
Just as soon as his divorce
Comes through
And it's not just a fling
He swears it's the real thing
A love that could last till the end
As he's driving away
You know it's true what they say
About married men
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it again and again
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it, married men
Oh he'll run when the scandal
Gets too hot to handle
He'll say I just want to be friends
They he'll walk out of your life
He'll go home to his wife
'Cause he's a married man
Oh your love is a secret
And you've got to keep it
As long as you can
No don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
The world is full of married men
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it again and again
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it, married men
He'll walk out of your life
And go home to his wife
A married man
Don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it again and again
They do it, they do it, they do it
They do it, married men....repeat and fade",(The World Is Full of) Married Men,1981

Hello to the rain

Bonnie Tyler,"In the middle of a sleepless night
Got a feeling and it just ain't right
The feeling just grows in my mind
Something's missing in the way we kiss
Never had so many nights like this.
Feels like a dream but it's true.

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you touch me
It's nothing like before
I know I don't take you to heaven anymore
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before
I can tell by the way you love me
It's nothing like before

In the middle of a lonely day
Though you're with me you're so far away
We used to be close real close
Baby can't you see the danger signs
Something's gone wrong can't you see.

I know I don't take you to heaven anymore

He's just a golden memory.

It's over, you can't turn the tide, and it's

Bonnie Tyler,"Now that you've gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories
Of what love could be
If you were
Still here with me

You took me from the shelter of a mother I had never known
The love of any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I waited in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk right through that door
And love me
Liked you tried before

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Since you've been gone

All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold",Band of Gold,1986

And where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need

I need a hero 
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life!

In my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach
There's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet

I need a hero

Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone, somewhere
Watching me
Through the wind, and the chill, and the rain
And the storm, and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

For somewhere to hide
Did you ever call out to someone
Did you ever call out to me, I've never been gone-
I've been right here by your side
There ain't nothin' but clouds
There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes

Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth
You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth
Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most
You're so busy trying to get even
You never even try to get close

I can't explain it away
It doesn't make any sense
To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby
Loving you's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when we'd never fake it
There were times when we'd always make it
There were times when we'd take it to the limit
And we'd never, never, ever leave each other alone
We wee flesh and blood and bone
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we took our chances
There were times we were damn good dancers
There were times when we heard all the answers
In the beating of the drummer
And the riches of the rock and the roll
I can see right through your soul
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

If your fears could only be forgotten
We could pull all the barriers down
Would you follow your dream's desire
Would you follow your secret dreams
And forbidden fire

It's been nothing but dreams until now
You're never gonna see it
You got your head stuck in the sand

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
Both: To the pounding, pounding chorus
Of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars
There were times we extinguished every fire
That was burning, burning, burning, up each other alive
From the heavens on down to the dives
There were times we lost it all
There were times we lost it all

There's nobody down in the woods

Were gonna do it outside

And I can feel the air it's sticking to our skin so tight
And I can feel there's something in this air tonight-
I really got it bad
Tonight I really got it bad
Tonight I really got it bad
But it's still so good, so good
That I got it at all and it was

See it shimmer down my dress

Tracing patterns on your chest
You're so ravishing

And I know
This is the season that we make our move
This is the season we've got something to prove
And this is the season I've got something to lose

And if an angel broke his wings
Would he come to you for parts
I need a couple of wings boy, boy
I need a reason to soar

And if the devil lost his fire
Could he count on you for sparks
There's something we ought to try now
We ought to try it some more-

Than anything I ever wanted was to see the light
And there's a chance that we'll be glowing in the dark tonight-

Tonight really got it bad
I really got it bad

You shot me where you wanted
You put me in a daze

No matter where you go, you'll always be a stranger
Getting into trouble, getting off on danger
Riding out of town like a cool lone ranger
When there's nothing to lose, you gotta call your own plays

Where the past goes on and on forever

And I feel it ever present
In every step I take alone

That separate our lives
From these streets we once called our home

How strong they are

And how weak they are

Does the morning sunlight
Still hit the bed where we used to lie

Do the sidewalk stands and markets still overflow
Where I lingered till I was empty
Where I stayed till I had to go
Though in the night

Sometimes I see you disappear
Down cobblestones
On the streets down in little Italy

There's a way, everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what good does it bring, if I ain't got you
If I ain't got you

You don't know what it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody, to love somebody
The way I love you

In my pain, I see your face again
It's burning in my mind
You ain't got to be so blind 
That I'm alive,
I'm a woman, can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do, if I ain't got you
If I ain't got you",To Love Somebody,1988
Bonnie Tyler,"I don't question the light that shines from your window
And i don't want to hear what the people might say
The think it's only lust, that's hidden in your shadow
But i know different, and that's okay
They've been abused and they're so confused
It's no wonder, they'll take what the can and run
They spend their life in the doorway
The doorway of a lifetime
And their aching arms give no reprise

'Cause they don't understand
It's not easy
Never has, or ever will be
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart
It's not easy
Never has, or ever will be
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart

Maybe the day will come
When the streets ain't full of everyone
Just trying to hang on to what the can
And you might find when you wake up
The break of dawn has come
And all the sisters of sin are awaiting you
They're waiting to wrap their empty shells
Around your warm, warm and loving heart
And to clutch at your breast with a hand of ice
So pray the winds of change
And don't let them bring you down
To that no good, no good, cheap-talking crowd

'Cause they don't understand
It's not easy
Never has, or ever will be
Take this loving from me, and you will break my heart
It's not easy

It's not easy

Bonnie Tyler,"Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone

Baby baby

[Chorus]
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl, she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew

Baby baby, baby baby 

[Chorus]

You got the kind of legs that do more than walk

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk

Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see

You got a lotta nerve to come on to me

You got the kind of lips that do more than drink

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone

His handkerchief bulge slipping from the middle
Strokes his chin as his eyes refocus

Some hold back some peel off the layers
The atmosphere erupts with the drunken liberators

As dancers jump like emancipated jackals
It won't be long till the first couple's clich?

""I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that!""

With a charmer boy in a second-hand leather

You can't make out through the naked muscle
A high pitched scream a broken bottle
A ribbon of blood on the floor

Proud to cry

If you will change your mind
Don't throw away this love babe

Oh darling I'm crazy after all these years

Come save a little room babe,
In your heart for me
We can make it better,
Love is a mystery
Oh darling I'm crazy after all these years

Oh I sold my heart to you,
I gave you love and heaven, too
Give me love, give me all,
Baby catch me when I'll fall tonight

You've gotta show me all the things you want to happen to you
We've gotta tell each other everything we always wanted someone to do

Was a bitter reflection of me

That you really were no longer here

I dream of home again
A thousand voices call to me
A cry that splits the night
Woke up the soul inside my memories
I chose to walk alone
To search and find my destiny
So many lonesome roads
Lead me away from where I long to be
When I awake and see a cold and empty room
I sit alone and think of places I once knew
The friends that I had loved and left behind
Oh, how could I have been so blind?

Back home
Where all the love is that I need
Where all my family waits for me
Back home
I close my eyes and I can see
Where the river meets the sea
Back home
There is no better place than home for me
'cause home is where I'll find my destiny

I'm going home again and I just can't wait to see
The folks that I have missed
A mother's tender kiss, so soft, so sweet
I'll hold her in my arms, like I'd never let her go
My family's my home and I will tell them that I love them so
Oh I know I've been away so very long
That I hurt you when I left and I was wrong
And I see that home is where my heart belongs
So hang on heart, 'cause her I come

Back home
Where all the love is that I need
Where all my family waits for me
Back home
I close my eyes and I can see
Where the river meets the sea
Back home
There is no better place than home for me
'cause home is where I'll find my destiny

Back home
Where all the love is that I need
Where all my family waits for me

Bonnie Tyler,"A long night
Cutting through the desert heat 
The sun was rising 
The day was rising the day was standing on it's feet 
I saw a long shadow snakin' down 
The dusty road side 
To where you were standing 
Waiting for the big ride
A vision in black no holding back
I pulled in along side
Drove till night falling light
The time has come to pay the price
You're driving me wild 
Driving me wild 
You turn me upside down 
Turn me around 
You make feel so good 
You're driving me wild

Everyone loves to dream
A real cliffhanger
A real good thriller
But how about love for real
There's a god in the sky 
'Cause we made it all night 
The warm river flowing inside 
But the river ran dry 
As day went by
He couldn't wait to say goodbye

Bonnie Tyler,"My friend you're worn out and aching now 
Your life stretched tight and breaking now 
And you seem to find that every morning's 
Like a mountain you must climb
Forget her, shake her free
Like a leaf from a tree, you must let her go 
It's hard I know
But tomorrow is another road that leads 
Away from here, to the first horizon 
Forget her
My friend you could open windows now 
Let cool breezes through your life somehow 
'Cause there's people out there, other people 
Crying dying trying to get somewhere
Forget her, let her go
With the ebb and flow of the passing tide 
Now she's fortune's bride
And the days line up like cards and you can deal 
Yourself a chance while the wheel's still turning 
Forget her
Well I'm so good at giving advice 
But I know when you look at my life 
It seems crazy
But I can stand aside 
And I can see with different eyes 
Sometimes more clearly
Forget her, till she sees
Like a face in a dream so far away 
She will fade away
And tomorrow is another road that leads 
Away from here, to the first horizon 
Forget her, she has forgotten you 
Forget her",Forget Her,1996
Bonnie Tyler,"I have given it all
I have taken all the punches
Back into the corner I crawl
Now the dice have tumbled

How the mighty stumble and fall
I have given it all
Left to dry in the rain 
Washed away by love's indifference 

Broken down, twisted and lame 
Hold me for a moment 
Help me find myself once again 
Take me in from the rain 

Shelter me from this pain
We wander from the straight and narrow and we 
Make the bed of nails that we lie upon 
We only need the warmth of love when it has gone 

Bring me in from the cold
At the end of every rainbow 
I'd have it all, I was told 
But in time, as colors faded 

Promises I traded for gold 
Bring me in from the cold 
And let me live with my soul
I'm searching for the strength inside of me 

But the road is long when you've lost your way
I reach out for a guiding light, it fades to grey
I have given it all
There've been times I may have hurt you 

Times I should have given you more 
But through it all just know I've loved you

No more escapes
Cause I'm tired of asking for more
Seems like a lifetime fading away
And I'm lost in an ocean of love
I'm reaching and holding onto my dreams
Cause I'm not alone anymore
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Spoken:
Far from those moments
When my eyes were still closed
Way over mountains
Higher than high
I could feel the breeze from below
It's like an ocean, ocean...heeeyehhh
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high
Like an ocean...
Way over mountains higher than high

Bonnie Tyler,"Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one, who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lives a seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose",The Rose,1999
Bonnie Tyler,"Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild

Glories stream of Heaven afar
Heavenly host sing alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born

Bonnie Tyler,"Morning has broken with silence in my room
Eyes have been opened with pain beneath the moon
Feelings that are colder than ice upon a rock
Endless nights of anger and hours filled with talk

Beauty of a lifetime a crystal-clear romance
Were supposed to be mine and join me in a dance
Days were filled with pleasure no clouds were in my sight
Love was our treasure that no one could deny...

But where do we go for here??
Soon will be too late
To go anywhere from here...
Soon will be too late...

Hopefully dreaming that love will still survive
Deep within me a song that never ever dies
All those days of passion and all those lonely nights
Must have been worth something, they lightened up my life

Come and lay beside me let gentle love be real
Look into my eyes for this is how i feel
Let me wipe your tears away you don't need to be sad
Share with me your dreams that once were all we had

But where do we go for here??
Soon will be too late
To go anywhere from here...

Drifting stars above the high trees
Recognise, see it's own destiny

Our future from tonight is through
I'm talking to you...

I know you feel the same way
We know the game we we could play
You know there's no turning back
We can start here....

Understand, listen to how we feel
It's the circle of our dreams
Touch me now or set me free
I'm talking to you...

Feeling like there's no way out

To look up in the sky
And see nothing but clouds
The last thing you said

You always saw the blue skies
Oh I'm sick and tired of yesterday
I think of all the times I chose the worst things
And I threw the best away
What would you say?
You know how hard it is
To keep from crying out loud
To look up in the sky
And see nothing but clouds
The last thing you said

Till I find a place to end this yearning

Out where the lightning splits the sea

Sometimes, late in the night
I wonder how it is
Two people so much in love
Should end up like this

May hear you somewhere
So many world's apart
When you think how close we were
It's enough to break your heart

Baby baby baby
Remember the love you gave me
Baby baby I remember you
Baby baby baby
Remember the love you gave me
'cause baby baby, I sure remember you

Sometimes, late in the night
Holding someone new
Sometimes I have closed my eyes
And thought that it was you

Dreams, dreams of what might have been
Is living in the past
I'm just glad that I knew you once
Although it couldn't last

Remember the love you gave me
'cause, baby baby I sure remember you...(x4)

Did you ever call out to me, I've never been gone- 
I've been right here by your side
There ain't nothin' but clouds
There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes

Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth
You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth
Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most
You're so busy trying to get even
You never even try to get close

I can't explain it away
It doesn't make any sense
To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby
Loving you's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when we'd never fake it
There were times when we'd always make it
There were times when we'd take it to the limit
And we'd never, never, ever leave each other alone
We were flesh and blood and bone
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we took our chances
There were times we were damn good dancers
There were times when we heard all the answers
In the beating of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll
I can see right through your soul
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

If your fears could only be forgotten
We could pull all of the barriers down
Would you follow your dreams' desire
Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire
Let's just peel out of this town

It's been nothing but dreams 
It's been nothing but dreams until now

You're never gonna see it

You got your head stuck in the sand

It's the land of the free and easy Street

It's the home of the damned

You're never gonna see it

You better open up your eyes

You're the only one who's left-

Who's gonna believe all your lies

I can't explain it away 
It doesn't make any sense

To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby

Loving you's a dirty job 
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when our bodies glistened 
There were times that we can't stop missing 
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen

To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars

There were times we extinguished every fire

That was burning, burning, burning up each other alive
From the heavens on down to the dives
There were times we lost it all we lost it all
There were times we lost it all we lost it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all",Loving You's a Dirty Job (But Somebody's Gotta Do It),2003
Bonnie Tyler,"There must be somethin' that we can share
Why is it all or nothin' everywhere
You got your life and i got mine
Why's our relationship hangin' on the line
I don't want to own you
I just want to know you
I just want to love you
More than words can say
Baby, take another look at your heart
And tell me you don't want me
Baby, tell me you're not comin' apart
I can hold out 'til you break
Baby take another look at your heart
You're breakin' up, that's no surprise
So much invested in our so-called ""love lives""
Give it up, heart over mind
You can't explain away

Bonnie Tyler,"There's no time now you said to be in love
Anyhow what is my life to you
Well there's no point it's true in pursuing you
And it's not that I can or I'd want to
But to be honest I'll say that there have been times
When I've desired a kiss or a smile
Once or twice you've shown the face I like
And it's affected me more than I'd want it to
But what's the use in telling you
If you don't feel the way I do
It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never have the chance to share it
Bye bye now my sweet love
Bye bye now my sweet love
Bye bye those tears I cry
I need you only to say goodbye
And now and again when I don't feel so shy
I pretend to remember your name
When the eyes don't see the heart doesn't feel
And the distance between us remains
But what's the use in telling you
If you don't feel the way I do
It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never get the chance to share it",Bye Bye Now My Sweet Love,2003
Bonnie Tyler,"All that I know is that I want you here with me
To hold you and never let go
All that I see is someone I love leaving me
And that's not the way I want it to be

'cause I wanna hold you and make you mine
And I wanna keep you for the rest of my life

I want you back in my arms
I need you here in my heart again
I want you back in my arms
That's where you belong, back in my arms

I still wake up thinking that you're next to me
But an empty space is all I see
And all I can do is let you know the way I feel
And I hope one day you feel it too

And if you need to take some time
I will be waiting if you change your mind

I want you back in my arms
I need you here in my heart again
I want you back in my arms
That's where you belong, back in my arms

And if you need to take some time
I will be waiting if you change your mind

I want you back in my arms
I need you here in my heart again
I want you back in my arms
That's where you belong, back in my arms

I want you back in my arms
I need you here in my heart again
I want you back in my arms
That's where you belong

I don't know why I'm taking you back
After all the heartache
I ought to have my head looked at

Tell me why you cheated
Don't try to pass the blame on me
I gave you all you needed
And still you have to play the field

Oh yes, I forgive you
But I won't to forget
I want to believe you
But no matter how hard I try

It's in the back of my mind all the time
It's in the way that you look my love
And threw it aside
Always in the back of my mind

Can you give me one good reason
Why I should be taking you back?
After all this heartache
Oh, I gotta get my head looked at

",It's in the Back of My Mind,2004
Bonnie Tyler,"I guess that you could say experience is mine
It's the only way to know where to draw the line
On what you really want and what you feel ain't good enough

And when I get something good I never let it go
And you're the one I want, I got to let you know
You got it all, no one could ask for more

Nobody can love me like you do
Nobody can touch me like you do
When it comes to love
There's nobody better than you

It's not the way you move, it's not the way you talk
It's not the way you look or the way you walk
It's something in you eyes makes me feel satisfied

Oh, when you came into my life you set my heart on fire
And if I said, I'd loved before, you know I'd be a liar

Nobody can love me like you do
Nobody can touch me like you do

Bonnie Tyler,"I never knew that I was standing in the rain
My mind was wandering back to you again
There's a thousand miles between us
Though it feels a thousand more 'cause tonight I sleep alone

I never realized how time could drag on
I never thought about how long the days are
And I never heard my heart beat
Till the first night you were gone then I knew I was alone

When I close my eyes and I think of you
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so blue
When I need you here, all I do
I close my eyes and I'm with you

I could see miracles, they wouldn't mean a thing
I don't want memories, if you're not part of them
Any photograph without you would never grace my wall
I don't wanna stand alone

When I close my eyes and I think of you
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so blue
When I need you here, all I do
I close my eyes and I'm with you, oh, yeah

Then I see you there and I visualize
Both of us touching, both of us searching
Then I hold you here, I can feel you now
I'm lost in the moment, lost in the moment

And I can't let go 'cause I won't let go
I will keep holding, I will keep holding
When I clear my eyes to wipe away my tears
Everything shatters, everything's gone

When I close my eyes and I think of you
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so blue

A man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor
A man who has lost faith in the peace makers of the West

Bono,"I want to be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I want to be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine",I Wanna Be Around,2006
Bono,"I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying 

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Mr. City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the eggman 
(""How do you do sir"")
They are the eggmen 
(""The man maintains a fortune"")
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob Goo Goo Goo g' joob

Expert, texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you
(Ho ho ho hee hee hee hah hah hah)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

Climbing up the Eiffel tower

Bono,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,2007

Me smoke heavy tar
Me be groovin' slowly where you are
Notify your next of kin
'Cause you're never coming back
I've been dropping beats since Back in Black

And we'll paint by numbers
'Til something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids
(So come on) jump on board
Take a ride (yeah)
(You'll be doin' it all right)
Jump on board feel the high
'Cause the kids are alright

You've got a reputation
Well I guess that can be explored
You're dancing with the chairman of the board
Take a ride on my twelve cylinder symphony
But if you got other plans
The purpose of a woman is to love her man

And we'll paint by numbers
'Til something sticks
Don't mind doing it for the kids

I'm gonna give it all of my loving
It's gonna take up all of my love

Come down from the ceiling
I didn't mean to get so high
I couldn't do what I wanted to do
When my lips were dry
You can't just up and leave me
I'm a singer in a band
Well I like drummers baby
You're not my bag

Jump on board
Take a ride, yeah

Jump on board feel the high, yeah

I'm an honorary Sean Connery, born '74
There's only one of me
Single-handedly raising the economy
Ain't no chance of the record company dropping me
Press be asking do I care for sodomy
I don't know, yeah, probably
I've been looking for serial monogamy
Not some bird that looks like Billy Connolly
But for now I'm down for ornithology
Grab your binoculars, come follow me",Kids [Live],2007

At the side of the road
