Linkin Park,"(Yeah) (Yo)
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back up, no, I'll hold myself
Check the rep, yep you know my rail
Forget the rest let them know my hell
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up the vets stay their
Let the rest be to tell they tale
That I was there saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying

In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up, and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go",Lost in the Echo,2012

Glistening and I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving now

Let me go

I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

King Push
Dope game keep callin'
Dope boys keep fallin'

I just wanna die ballin'
I just wanna die pourin'
I just wanna ride foreign
I just wanna bring hoes together

(Wooo!) Then I be gone, keep it movin', what I be on
Damn right I know what time it is
Patek Philippe and the Tourbillion (Yuugh!)
I'm stylin' on 'em, I'm swervin' on 'em
I know it's wrong, but life's a bitch and she turn me on!

Yeah, and to each his own
Hand me some that reefer dome
Is the way I flip when the beat come on
I gonna pop that shit 'til your speakers blown
And y'all wanna cop a plea
Who you gon' talk to? Not to me
Because the chain of command work properly
You gotta earn a few stripes 'til you talk to me
Word to Pusha, word to Vice
Built a track once and killed it twice
Built a stage up and killed the lights
Opening act was like ""Fuck my life""
Y'all can love it, ain’t nothing wrong
Forget the hatin' that y'all be on
Enjoy it now because after long
Keyser Söze, I'll be gone

I’ll be gone!
I’ll be gone!

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone

Only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease
Only grow
You better be prepared to fight

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

There's no pain
It was there
And it has become your only right
And words you lost
In your despair

Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights

If my armor breaks

Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

Should’ve played safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn’t understand
Never could’ve planned
They made me who I am

Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These years you’re never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

I guess that I had to find out for myself

Man, playing guitar and singing is really hard
Dude, Mike is back here like playing drums, playing keyboards, guitars, rapping
And I'm like, oh, five thumbs
Do you wanna take a break from guitar and singing for a minute then?
What's that?
Do you wanna take a break from it then?
Oh no I like playing guitar, it's super fun
I mean if you can't have fun doing this you'r doing it wrong, you know what I mean?",Sharp Edges [One More Light Live],2017

La couronne j'braque nerveux, dope mon rap à la testostérone
J’étais un merdeux, plein d’attitude, peu d’ambition
Cauchemardeux, j’ai fait mes études dans un buisson
La putain d'cuisson?
Tu connais, l'son on l’aime saignant dans l'coin
Les mots crus, la tête brûlée à point sous l'bonnet
Check un-deux, on est microphone-toxo'
Reconnais qu'si t’es d'taille, t’es rare comme une putain sans proxo’
On est en 95, le morceau c’est ""Balltrap"", puissant
J'fête mes 20 piges au poste, menottes serrées jusqu’au sang
La chasse au flouze assassine l’innocence, comme grandir près des piquouzes
À l’âge bête dans une partouze, perdre son pucelage
Prête l’oreille, épouse ma cause ou pas
J'm’apprête à faire pousser des roses sur un tas d'bouse

J't’emmène en virée dans les rues d'ma vie
Dans c'Monde j'purge ma peine, j’sais pas combien d'temps j’ai à tirer
J’ai pété la vitre quand j’ai vu les portes du succès closes
J'me confesse
J’ai créé ma prose dans les rues d'la ville

La dalle j'connais, j’en parle peu par respect pour mes géniteurs
La drogue comme thérapeute, à la banque d'la morale j’suis débiteur
Mec depuis ti-pe j'dérape, dans l'collimateur des schmitts
J’glisse sur un terrain râpeux, c’est dans mes raps qu'ça s'ressent
J’ai eu l'vice précoce, l’odeur du sang, la pisse, les plans stressants
Depuis qu’on est gosses mes frangins et moi, trop nombreux mais pas numérotés
On a expérimenté l'cheu-arra, déjà tout jeunes ça carrotait
Y’avait d'la joie dans nos trous à rat, c’était loin d’être Rio
Enfance bercée par les cris, menaces d’expulsion du proprio
On aime la vie alors on s'cramponne, prend la fourrure par la crinière
Mêmes paralysés par une rafale dans la moelle épinière
J'm'en tamponne, un chouia obsédé fallait l'présager
Gamin, j’ai fait des tonnes de trucs avec une conne plus âgée
J'reste enragé, j'vous emmerde, c'rap c'est mon blues
Sur ma mère, j'm’apprête à faire pousser des roses sur un tas d'bouse

Quand l'daron est parti, j’étais pas un homme, encore un merdeux
Paix à son âme, devant la somme d’emmerdes M'man pleurait pour deux
J’attrape mon arme, mes pieds épousent le béton à merveille
Ses larmes j'les ai pas vues, trop occupé à rien foutre
Quand la rue surveille, le sort te shoote ou t'braque
J’ai rien trouvé d'mieux qu'ramener des tas d'flics retourner la baraque
Dire que l'destin nous a mal notés ? C’est ça
Y’a rien d'pire pour une mère que d'voir son fils mourir ou partir menotté
C’est ma rédemption d'délinquant, ce son m'foudroie
Ça nique le mental, comme voir son premier cadavre à cinq ans
Maintenant j'marche droit ou presque
J’ai trouvé un camp, béni mes proches
Seul l’échec viendra assassiner ma fresque
J'serai pas criminel, parc'que c’est c'que leurs statistiques disent
Le Ciel nous vise depuis l'péché originel
Oublie les pronostics, moi j't’offre une virée dans mes shoes
2005 c’est Ärsenik, j’fais pousser des roses sur un tas d'bouse

Lino,"Sans visa, tracer en classe première, le visage collé au hublot
Quitter ces paysages de merde, mettre le turbo loin de ces villes grises
Fais passer le message, t’auras beau m’endormir
Mais quand il crise, le peuple, c’est mauvais présage
Les barrières tombent, les cris, on a l’avantage du nombre
J’écris, Dieu protège mes arrières, une ombre plane sur l’instru'
Sans panne, je me livre, mon skeud, un cru 2005
C’est ça être libre, avancer, même le chargeur vide
C’est quand le cœur guide les actions, être libre, c’est résister
Brailler parce qu’on existe, pas pour exister
C’est faire ce qu’on est, être fier, jeune et con
On n’est peut-être pas frères, mais tous prisonniers
Sûrement, c’est ça être libre

Vivre libre, briser ses chaînes
Ce qui nous bloque, ce qui nous freine
Libre, Certain que ça en vaut la peine

C’est en vouloir, rouler à l’instinct, rester debout
Voir son destin au bout d’un couloir et ne pas s’arrêter
La rage dans les intestins, s’apprêter au pire
Ouvrir l’œil au jour le jour, fêter en attendant le deuil
C’est couvrir d’un linceul ses craintes, courir
Ma clique, un paquet de soldats avançant comme un seul
C’est mourir un peu dès qu’un des nôtres chute
Nourrir un feu même sous les insultes
C’est croire ou ne pas croire, on porte le foulard ou la croix
Au risque de choquer France, je revendique cicatrices et différences
Hors de la matrice, je secoue tellement la rue qu’elle en vibre
C’est ça, être libre

Vivre libre, briser ses chaînes
Ce qui nous bloque, ce qui nous freine
Libre, Certain que ça en vaut la peine

C’est ne pas aller dans le sens du vent, avoir du franc-parler
Tu vends ton âme ou t’élèves la voix?
J’fais chialer ma plume, à la fois clair et obscur, j’suis paré
Je m’assume moi, je suis le premier à qui je dois plaire
Être libre, c’est goumer même quand faut payer le tarot
Essayer de garder le moral même derrière des barreaux
Connaître le passé, et au présent renaître
C’est les bif’ qui font courir les gens
Où est l’esclave, où est le maître?
Un spliff, un bon à mettre dans le poste et j’quitte ma taule
Esquive le réel, j’vis entre l’enclume et le marteau
Innonde les ruelles, les ondes, je les cribles
Devenir l’inverse de ce qui divise le monde, c’est ça, être libre",Chant Libre,2006
Lino,"Tant que y aura des putes, des macs
Des buts à atteindre, des plaques à prendre
Des paquets de gens qui luttent pour une cause
Des parquets, des jeunes qui chutent aux assises

Tant qu'y aura des banques à braquer
Des tas de choses à dire, des raisons de craquer
De partir en couille en martyr
Tant que y aura des tas de douilles encore fumantes sur le sol
Des patrouilles, tant qu'on aura que la violence comme argument
Tant qu'ils auront pas ma dépouille et que pour se faire entendre faudra se taper
Tant que y aura des ""nègres"" et des ""crouilles"" j'aurai de quoi rapper
On passe pas entre les gouttes, on se mouille

Tant que la France sera pas prête à voir des tas de bronzés dans son écran
Tant que Marianne m'aura pas astiqué la trique

Petit mouton sors du troupeau assassine le berger

Évident, tant que je sortirai pas sans blinder le trois quart
Tant qu'on se fera flinguer, tiré à vue de dos ou de trois quarts
Et que j'aurai du mal à distinguer meurtre et bavure
C'est Lima, India, November, Oscar
Pas une gravure de mode, je suis l'image de la haine
Lascar, sur une prod' animale
Que Dieu nous parraine, mon vacarme, ma rime me sortent de l'anonymat
Un mauvais climat règne, on marine dans de l’éther
L'audimat pète, ça saigne comme Tony les narines pleines de coke
On nous enseigne l'art de courber l'échine
Dès le premier biberon à devenir des carburant pour la machine
""Seuls les forts vivront""
Imagine la scène, tant que j'y croirai, qu'un seul vienne les autres suivront
Tant que y aura ces veines que le sort tranche, ces chaînes à nos poignets
De la blanche, de l'héro de la fonce-dé pour s'éloigner
Tant qu'on sera au point zéro à pisser dans la guitare
Tant que y aura des putains de matons, des frères au mitar
Des mères au parloir, des pères brisés, condition trop sale
Visés par la loi, handicapés social
Tant qu'on sera autant à l'aise dans ce ""biz"" que dans le comico
Ils préféreraient me voir avec un flingue plutôt qu'un micro
Tant que y aura le bordel ou ça schlingue
Mon son ira immortel sur disque dingue
Je suis en mode guerre comme en Iraq
Les MC ont de la bile à se faire, regardez vos montres

La roue tourne, c’est un casino, la vie, c’est ce qu’on dit
On passe par les cuisines de l’enfer pour se poser au paradis
Saisis nos rimes, cousine, écoute mon cœur causer
A chaque prestation, les ondes, je reviens arroser
Les mecs, c’est des pulsations cardiaques, ces kits de batterie
A chaque, poum poum tchak, après l’impact, crie
Je sors de ma crypte, largue le truc
Sur ma vague, viens surfer, c’est réel, c’est pas un clip
On sait pas bluffer, c’est le langage du cœur

On parle le langage du cœur, jamais à demi-mot
Oui tu sais, le langage du cœur fait souvent défaut

Oui, tu vois, le langage du cœur ne se traduit pas
(On bluffe pas), tu auras beau tendre l'oreille
Soit tu piges, soit tu piges pas

On parle le langage du cœur, ça n’engage que moi
Ma clique, mon microphone, Wallen te le dit dans les chœurs
En cage après 2002, mon adrénaline fuse
J’en ai pour qui veut, sur la ligne, je reste, ma rage, on diffuse
L’instru', je le câline pas, je refuse de me coucher
T’amuses ta galerie, t’es de la baise, excuse, ma langue a fourché
J’apaise tes douleurs en kickant loin des clichés
Expliquant aux petits que c’est l’heure, qu’on a assez négligé le fond
Affiché sur les murs en posters ou niché dans les sonos
Reste toi-même les vrais gangsters font pas de promo
Obligé de le pisser, je peux pas le taire
J’ai que 12 mesures chrono, je termine en espérant que t’aies pigé le truc

Lino,"Les putains de jours passent et se ressemblent
Les tours cachent l’horizon, les spliffs tournent, rassemblent
On fait ses classes dans les cours de prisons
Les soces, la famille, disons que les grosses liasses stimulent
Enterre les amis, souvent on y passe mais la vie continue
Un putain de vice peut en cacher un autre
Il dissimule sa haine, la reum elle, la rue lui a déjà prit un fils
Le daron lui parle comme il cogne mais à force on s’habitue
Sent plus les coups, le cœur béton comme un bout de bitume
Il tue le temps, à moins que ce soit le contraire
Avec ses confrères, dans le crime, il tombe dans tous les pièges que la rue tend
Gratte deux trois rimes de quartiers, sur les shmits et l’état
Enragé, une moitié du temps, et l’autre pété au shit
Il a des rêves, pourtant, des envies d’exil
Guette la carte du monde, relit les lettres de son frangin au placard
Ça dit le vrai luxe c’est être libre, l’homme est pas fait pour la cage
Personne n’est parfait, comme leur dernier braquage
Alors il gamberge, en nage, allongé sur son lit superposé
Pense à changer de berge, les yeux explosés, il pense

Il se lève, prends son ? sous le lit, enroulé dans une veste
Sourit à sa mère, lui fait un geste de la main
Claque la porte, rejoint le reste de l’équipe
Les potes, ça s’engraine, les voix portent, putain venez on sait ou cette pute traîne
La daronne, guette par la fenêtre, regarde son fils partir
Cette nuit, c’est la dernière fois qu’elle entendra parler de lui

Elle a l’âge des premières fois, l’âge où on teste la vie
L’âge où on aime autant qu’on se déteste
L’âge où le seul avis qu’on aie, c’est celui des autres
Tous dans le même navire, elle était cool avant que sa reum perde les eaux
Tout s’écroule quand ses parents divorcent, les coups
Les rapports de force, plus personne à l’écoute car plus de réseau
Adolescence meurtrie, cicatrice ambulante
Le cœur blessé, prend le premier petit con venu pour une ambulance
Une vie stressée, sans but, sans tarder
Elle donne son petit corps à qui sait la regarder, et encore
C’est une grande pute la vie, elle assemble ses putains d’souvenirs
Elle se rappelle, les nombreuses visites nocturnes
De papa dans sa chambre
Et elle fume, fait le mur, enrage, déjà mure avant l’âge
Attend sa mue après l’orage, ça ne peut qu’être mieux
Elle tombe accro d’un raclo plein de promesses
Tout est OK, jusqu’au jour où elle lui annonce qu’elle est cloquée
Le jour de ses 18 piges, tout est noir ce soir de décembre
On l’a retrouvée dans sa baignoire, baignant dans son sang

Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?

Il a le poing tranché, des gouttes de sang viennent tacher le sol
Encore une gorgée d’alcool, encore un cachet
Chargé, il guette son visage déformé dans la glace brisée
C’était le fils sage, désormais ses putains de démons le suivent à la trace
D’un monde aseptisé, pousser à réussir très tôt
A viser le top, à vivre les rêves de ses parents, leur véto, oui il en crève
Gosse transparent, éternel premier de la classe
Tout part en couille et se casse, personne n’a rien vu venir
Il se fracasse la tête contre les murs
Passe la plupart du temps seul devant sa glace
Genre, c’est à moi que tu parles?
Génération X, héritier de la violence des aînés
Une étincelle sur une traînée de poudre qui voulait juste être aimée
Des années, à kiffer sur une fouf qui s’en branle, l’étouffe
Il s’en prend à dieu, prie le diable, s’imaginant à deux dans le gouffre
Il a des pulsions meurtrières et veut sortir des ténèbres
Le souffre douleur d’hier, deviendra célèbre
Tristement, Le poing tranché, des gouttes de sang sur le sol
Encore une gorgée d’alcool, encore un cachet
Les armes chargées de son daron, entassées dans un sac de sport
Il se dirige vers son lycée pour inverser le score
Il arrive, pointe une première cible, et la ça tourne au drame
Et la suite, elle fera la une des journaux

Pour les gosses d’ici, de là-bas, du bled, ou d’ailleurs
Quartiers difficiles ou pas, j’plaide
Qui est coupable quand ça tourne au drame, que le coup part

Nous sommes des bêtes de somme, maîtres ou esclaves, en somme
Simples lettres, petites ou grosses sommes
Amis ou traîtres, ennemis, peut-être
Ou tout simplement des hommes?
Des âmes perdues sans guides
Nos armes braquent le bonheur, Sésame s’ouvre
Comme la trappe sous nos pieds précipite mon corps dans le vide
Nos Dieux sont en papier et c’est leur amour qui nous suicide
On est frappés par la foudre, comme conduits par un fou
Rattrapés par nos démons, la cervelle brûlée par la poudre
C’est encore loin l'Paradis?
Hé, c’est à combien l'Paradis?
Ce Monde me blesse la rétine
Me laisse aucuns choix d'la tétine à la tombe
À Dieu j'm’adresse certains soirs
Quand j'cherche un peu d'clarté, un sens à cette vie
J'me remémore le quartet, naissance, école, boulot et mort
Où est ma place, mon camp ici, croyant ou athé'?
J'suis à l’abri des missiles, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’ai porté ma croix, maté mon côté sombre, et les trois six
Ecarté le mal, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’suis là, assis seul dans les ténèbres, braquant le ciel du regard
On a l’art d'pisser la douleur quand on est nègre
Le bien a déserté l’écran, on célèbre nos noces de feu
L’argent veut assassiner Dieu, le trône est vacant
Sur toutes les lèvres, on lit la même prière
Mais si on vise
Si l'Tout-Puissant est amour, pourquoi sa parole divise?
Le Monde est à nous, vu qu’on y vit

C’est réel, c’est pas MTV
Y'a rien d'glamour mais j'relativise
J’avoue, la vie, elle a un drôle de sens de l’humour
Parfois, l'long du tunnel, on voit pas l'bout, mec, dans l'ghetto, on craque
Destin tracé comme le fœtus d’une mère défoncée au crack
La foi dans l'Créateur, pas en l’homme et ses légions
Mal comprise, religion devient arme de destruction massive
Ta guerre c’est un braquo, déguisé en juge de cause
Un ange qui ment sous serment, des mômes qu’on arrose pour des gisements d'brut
J'te cause de rêves qui s’écroulent comme les Tours Jumelles
Cette pute de liberté qui perd son rimmel
Dans les rivières d'la haine, coule le sang des martyrs
Quand la peur gagne par KO, la morale repart en civière
Proche du chaos, mon cœur abrite le feu de Lucifer
Mais là-haut, faudra s’y faire, on nous a laissés le libre-arbitre
C’est la canicule, tout s’agite, le Sud encule le Nord
Le sol rougit, on changera pas ce monde à moins d’un paquet d'millions de mort

Ce môme qui braille c'est rien qu'une autre victime qui vient au monde
C'est ça pleurs petit, bienvenue dans les entrailles du monstre
Première entaille, monte le son, j'graille le mic
J'suis dans la cabine derrière l'équipe prépare déjà la tiraille
J'me rehabille, repars au turbin, froid et urbain
Pour ceux qui l'aime sec, mon rap donne naissance aux 22ème siècle
J'veux l'monde comme ce gangster cubain
Aux putain d'portes de l'enfer la rue arrache leurs ailes aux chérubins
A trop économiser sa rage, notre son se vide de son sens
J'l'entend agoniser quand le monde se vide de son sang
Y'a nos textes à l'Eiysée, c'est la chanson d'la guillotine
Donne du feu, deux feuilles, du shit, un peu d'nicotine (brisée)
L'ambience part en couille, horrible t'es visé, Booba, Ärsenik
Arme de première catégorie
On m'dit de choisir entre flingue et ière-pri
J'prend la prière et garde le flingue près de moi au cas où Jésus serait pris",Première Catégorie,2006
Lino,"J'garde un œil fixé, sur la rue j'ai la bonne cadence
Si t'as pas la carrure laisse j'assure la permanence
J'ai mixé vodka et rage c'est Bors tu m'remets?
Putain d'solidaire comme un renoi devrait l'être un 22 mai
Mec t’adhères au truc ou pas, rien à foutre j'suis coupable
Si la nature fait bien les choses autant enfermer la foudre
J'ai pas de soupape de sûreté j'fous la merde, tu me vises et si le coup part
Je rentre dans le trou dans la légende comme 2Pac
Mon crew mon gang acquiesce j'étrangle le microphone troue l'beat
Et repart avec la caisse, j'prends ma part, rap sans la caisse le kick, le charley
Mais qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour mettre le faya
Et hurler notre haine un gaillard élevé à la dure
J'suis pas la solution dont tu parles
Signe moi mon chèque on fera la révolution plus tard
Cul-sec j'bois la vie, j'suis cru tchek!
La plupart des mecs parlent de la rue mais combien la vivent?
Tout le monde veut sa part du steak mais la bête est malade
Rare sont ceux qui graillent dans la zik et combien en vivent?
Quand nous on voudrait être sourds, eux voudraient qu'on se taise
Qu'on reste en dessous, qu'on se taise!
Donc j'rentre dans l'instru où est ma chaise?
Mec fais le ou crève, la réalité c'est un cauchemar pour ceux qui rêvent!

J'suis fatigué de plaider coupable avant le procès
Joue pas avec mes putain de nerfs!
C'est quoi les faits qui me sont reprochés?
Fatigué de cocher les cases mauvaises
Les voir hocher de la tête sur mes phases et retourner vos vestes
Fatigué de ces labels qui tiennent ma rage par les couilles
On veut qu'ça kick vu que chez nous on comprend rien à part les coups
Fatigué d'voir ce putain de monde en 16:9
Du biz' j'ai fugué, j'ai crié hip-hop pour qu'il revienne
Fatigué de cracher ma haine dans l'anti-pop
Écoute! Fatigué d'entendre ""Bors refais-nous Quelques gouttes""
Fatigué d'être raide 8 jours sur 7
J'lâche des bijoux lyricaux
Et on retient que les putains de rimes où je pars en sucette
J'suis venu beugler dans le micro en live du peuple
Fatigué de voir comment un écran peut aveugler un peuple
J'suis fatigué ils ont voulu tester ma résistance
Ghetto S.T.A.R on tire à distance

Monte le son ce monde me stresse et ce mouv' me fatigue
Sur les ondes j'l'ouvre mec laisse-moi lâcher la pression
Sur basses et grosse caisse laisse-moi lâcher la pression
Mec laisse moi, laisse moi lâcher la pression

J'emmerde la norme et le correct politiquement
ça se saurait si je prêchait j't'informe uniquement
Lécher j'sais pas l'faire
Logiquement, t'es censé bouger
T'as tout ce qu'il te manque
Dans mon son t'as plus qu'à bouger
Ils te mentent ce qui t'disent que le hardcore a plus d'jus
C'est le ciment les jeunes crisent, c'est encore plus dur
J'la brise l'ambiance à l'usure ce monde m'a pris
C'est comme une main sur la bible l'autre sur un flingue quand tu jures
Fatigué de m'faire d'la bile, pour nos rejetons
On raque au futur michtons, n'oublie jamais l'habit n'fait pas le mac
J'suis fatigué d'entendre le même son, des rimes tendres l'industrie du disque
C'est le bifton et l'hamecon
Si t'étudies lâche pas arrache les diplômes
Marche pas avec les putes, guette les schmits si tu deales
Icône des sous-sols, idylle entre acier et soie
Et Babylone me conseille d'enlever mes lacets et m'asseoir

Monte le son ce monde me stresse et ce mouv' me fatigue
Sur les ondes j'l'ouvre mec laisse-moi lâcher la pression
Sur basses et grosse caisse laisse-moi lâcher la pression
Mec laisse moi, laisse moi lâcher la pression

J'suis fatigué d'me justifier
Ma loi, mon code c'est violence certifié et racaille identifié
Comme l'auteur du délit
Je m'y fais on dit qu'les derniers seront les premiers à graille c'est dans les livres
Fatigué d'me méfier de mes soss
C'est réel quand j'parle j'n'ai confiance qu'en mes ennemis
Par ce qu' les ennemis ne changent pas
Fatigué, il y a trop de taf pour laisser faire l'entourage
J'incite pas à la violence moi je l'encourage si nécessaire
Trop de bourrage de crâne j'me sens offensé
La zik coupe-la fatigué d'entendre qu'le rap français ça groove pas
J'ai l'air d'me plaindre des fois j'veux tout niquer
Graver mon timbre de voix
Dans les têtes fatigué des ces rappeurs qu'on tout le même faux vécu
Même flow même sosie le reflet du clone a ton frère jumeau
Fatigué de ces mômes qu'entende sans écouter
Il y a trop longtemps qu'j'braille dans l'hexagone j'ai shooté le beat

Tu sais, y'a drogue et alcool dans le processus créatif
J'augmente la masse et les degrés Celsius sans feu ni créatine

Vite je me soulage l'âme à l'oral
Fêlé, j'suis l'élu m'a dit l'oracle
L'électron libre, j'ai l'aura qui luit sous la lune
Lance des litres de lyrics et les livre comme les lamelles dans l'alu
Pas de larmes sous l'iris, j'ai l'allure d'un 9 millis
Je rap au feeling, illico je file, j'allume, c'est du Kill Billy
Ça fait kill kill, là j'écris l'hymne de la ville
Ça kill kill kill comme Lil W Eazy #AMilli
J'me lâche sur leurs sales styles en leasing en 6 millimètres
Le cash et l'illicite lient les lascars auxquels je m'affilie

J'lance l'hymne de la tess, et l'étale comme une diablesse féline
C'est luxe et salopes à l'écran
Des grosses liasses, des lignes blanches, l'enfer, ses délices
Et je lance l'alerte avant qu'mes négros se lassent
La playlist j'lui fait un lifting
C'est lisse et trop classe comme du Céline
L'industrie et moi c'est Lefty et Donnie sans la la

Mon arme chante et j'marche seul comme dit l'autre
J'vous laisse rêver d'un monde sans crime
Crevé, j'm'arrache sur mon îlot, douleurs sans cris
J'suis revenu du brasier en footing
J'diffuse mon savoir, j'fais des drives-by shooting
C'est mort ça commence à se voir

Petite guérilla sur un son, bavard, j'suis un nègre en or
Impact de balle en guise de poinçon
J'laisse cogner mes vers, j'attends la pluie de météores
Les remords frappent à visage découvert donc je reconnais mes torts
Et j'appuie où ça fait mal, le fond la forme mon harmonie
Y'a plus qu'des Tony, Many, Nino et Gee Money
L'amitié s'monnaie, l'amour se planque dans un bar à hôtesses
La liberté à Osny, loin de nos tess'
J'te rappe les chroniques d'un drame annoncé vu que mon art proteste
Avec la même ironie qu'un canon-scié
Mon nid je l'ai fait dans une cible avant de partir au bout du monde
Genre missile j'trace déter comme un martyr au bout d'une bombe
La place j'éclaire, ça tire, je crache du plomb
J'ai grandi cité carter, entre l'truand et l'bon
Avant qu'on me la retire la vie, j'écris à l'encre de mes artères
La foudre j'attire, j'irai au paradis en charter
J'ai le Peter Pan syndrome mais sans la berceuse S.V.P
Cherche l'assassin de mon enfance avec un pompe sur l'siège bébé
Musique à tête chercheuse, j'rêve d'une bombe à la Fashion Week
Trop en avance j'ai mon LP dans la Playstation 8
Puis FPP, on blesse apprenti punchliner
Pas facile de me faire l'œil du tigre avec du eyeliner

Rap Call Of Duty en ce qui me concerne, j'adoucis pas les titres
C'est pas du Polanski, ma 'zique touche pas les p'tites
J'suis pas venu parler fric, j'ai pris la pilule rouge à Morpheus
Une mèche, du plastic j'fais du Wolfgang Amadeus

La rue fait ""Oui"" de la tête à chaque mesure que je crache
Ça pue le classique, un son de crapules
Wolfgang, Wolfgang
Le beat on l'plastique, j'cache une menace sous la capuche
L'ambiance la brûle
Wolfgang, Wolfgang
'Zique de parias, les rats des blocks en redemandent
Wolfgang, ça reste basique les rats des blocks en redemandent, eh!
On fait dans le tragique, j'compose des gros concertos en Do majeur
Wolfgang, Wolfgang, Wolfgang!

Si les hommes naissent pour mourir, mes requiems sont des berceuses
Les flammes j'les nourris, j'écris des missives à têtes chercheuses
Prêt à faire feu, le disque est sur la rampe de lancement
Un beat nerveux, un sample comme au commencement
Mon nom sur le missile, ça semble étrangement
Calme ici comme avant l'orage
Du verbe, des homicides, tous mes vieux démons font plus leur âge
J'atteins mes cibles, j'rappe, fauche les mots, le groove on l'aime sec
J'serais une légende vivante si j'étais mort au 18ème siècle
Mais j'sais pas mourir faut l'admettre, j'suis lucide et pas pressé
Comme si j'écrivais ma lettre de suicide sur mon avis de décès
J'ai pris des coups pour une vie parfaite sans les menottes et l'palier
Mon dégoût de la défaite est plus violent qu'mon envie de gagner
J'viens pour brûler la fête, maintenant le feu tu sais qui l'a mis
J'prends pas ma retraite, j'leur passe le relais,
C'est un bâton de dynamite
Kick, charley, gros tsunamis dans un verre de vodka sec
La rue m'admire depuis l'époque du poste cassette
De l'art de la douleur t'entendras pas mon microphone gémir
Y'a les génies, les escrocs, moi j'suis un escroc de génie!
Un accroc dans leur plans j'leur ai mise vu qu'ils veulent qu'on cesse
Les meilleurs partent en premier sauf quand il est question de sexe

De l'autre côté du globe, on s'immole, des murs se dressent

J'suis pas donneur de leçons, pas meilleur qu'un autre, j'ai juste pigé
Qu'enfants on tuait l'temps, maintenant on rêve de l'figer
Sans excédent d'bagages, j'voyage léger, les regrets, c'est lourd
Nous, on sort en meute au crépuscule, la lune, c'est l'soleil des loups
On blâme la bombe, pas celui qui l'a amorcé
Le vice est insomniaque, y'a des traces de piqûres sur les bras d'Morphée
Le game est truqué, ils veulent que j'mette un bémol
Tous hypnotisés par l'écran, éduqués par Endemol
Des questions connes sans réponse, savent plus quel Dieu invoquer
Surtout ne pas s'poser les bonnes comme, ""À quoi ça sert d'voter?""
Encore, à moins qu'il fasse un putain d'froid polaire en enfer
J'sais que c'est les fous qui ont raison, j'fais confiance qu'aux hommes en colère
Les saisons crèvent, on chie pas d'biff alors on rêve une fois dans l'sas
Braquer un peu d'kiffe, j'lis l'évangile selon Goldman et Sachs

Dis-moi à quoi tu rêves, dis, à quoi tu penses?
Ne regarde plus vers hier, l'horizon est immense
Dis-moi à quoi tu rêves, il faut que tu avances
Moi, j'entendrai tes prières, j'écouterai tes silences

Dis-moi à quoi tu rêves, à quoi tu penses?
Dis-moi à quoi tu rêves, l'horizon est immense

Quand on parle du burkini, on parle pas de Burkina
Quand on parle de république, on parle pas de coup d'état
C'est comme parler de séisme en oubliant ses répliques
On vient convertir les sceptiques, les éclairer, chauffer leur climat
Nous on s'pose patient, pile à la croisée des icebergs
Surtout garder le cap sur le phare sans ça on va se perdre
Superman punch, dark, sans la cape
Mes lyrics aspergent le beat
J'braque c'est l'vrai rap, ta merde échoue sur la berge
Tant d'rêves avortés dans les barges, de corps sans vie sur les plages
L'ascenseur est social, il montera jamais à l'étage
Entre les pétages de plomb, les cases, les barreaux, les pages
Ma vie j'écris ambiance électrique, vite, on les tase
Tout comme Tom, il veulent nous baricader tous dans les cases
Fuir, les p'tits chevauchent les dos des pétasses comme les ailes de Pégase
Et ça gase dans les grosses caisses, nous on s'place sur la grosse caisse
À nos cou, pas de grosses laisses, monstre comme au Loch Ness
Noir son darkness, Saian Supa, j'trou l'beat
J'suis un dragon asthmatique : j'tousse et j'fous l'faya
Rien que deux p'tits bout de bois et quelques brindilles
On te ramène le feu comme Bear Grylls

Les principes en charpie, ils aimeraient bien nous charcler
Mais le crew qui s'présente vient ouvrir un nouveau chapitre
J'entretiens avec l'état une relation tarifée
Vierge scarifiée vrai, j'suis d'ceux qui foutent la merde au gala d'charité
Je clash homme, femme : j'suis pour la parité
J'te parle cash, j'suis d'l'époque j'crache la qualité avant la quantité
Nous quantifier? Comment le pourraient-ils?
Sans même nous regarder comment pourraient-ils voir cette bête qui dort au fond de nos rétines
Ici on mène la lutte vu qu'espérer ne plus avoir une rue à son nom
Et que les pigeons, les chiens chient dessus
Est, ouest, nord suit le sud. J'ai du lyrics gardé wesh
Ouais j'échange la fréquence si t'as envie d'sucre
Ils parlent de conséquences avant les causes
Cogne le beat, traverse le mur du son, on passe entre les fissures
Pile sur le temps, on tombe, bardés de phrases acides
Gant noir au poing, chaque jour on assassine des phrases faciles
On se trompe pas de cible et on baissera pas le rythme
Combien de lions se sont transformés en toutou docile?
Je ferai une grande boucherie halal rue Solférino
Pour le kiff de les écouter six mois
Tourner-les, des pas dans le vide et troquer le fond pour le buzz

Tant qu'y aura des banques à braquer
Des tas de choses à dire, des raisons de craquer
De partir en couille en martyr
Tant que y aura des tas de douilles encore fumantes sur le sol
Des patrouilles, tant qu'on aura que la violence comme argument
Tant qu'ils auront pas ma dépouille et que pour se faire entendre faudra se taper
Tant que y aura des ""nègres"" et des ""crouilles"" j'aurai de quoi rapper

C'est Lima, India, November, Oscar
Pas une gravure de mode, je suis l'image de la haine
Lascar, sur une prod' animale
Que Dieu nous parraine, mon vacarme, ma rime me sortent de l'anonymat
Un mauvais climat règne, on marine dans de l’éther
L'audimat pète, ça saigne comme Tony les narines pleines de coke
On nous enseigne l'art de courber l'échine
Dès le premier biberon à devenir des carburant pour la machine

Des mères au parloir, des pères brisés, condition trop sale
Visés par la loi, handicapés social
Tant qu'on sera autant à l'aise dans ce ""biz"" que dans le comico
Ils préféreraient me voir avec un flingue plutôt qu'un micro
Tant que y aura le bordel ou ça schlingue

Lino,"Simples maillons, on est c'que la vie veut qu'nous soyons
Nous sommes des bêtes de somme, maîtres ou esclaves, en somme
Simples lettres, petites ou grosses sommes
Amis ou traîtres, ennemis, peut-être
Ou tout simplement des hommes?
Des âmes perdues sans guides
Nos armes braquent le bonheur, Sésame s’ouvre
Comme la trappe sous nos pieds précipite mon corps dans le vide
Nos Dieux sont en papier et c’est leur amour qui nous suicide
On est frappés par la foudre, comme conduits par un fou
Rattrapés par nos démons, la cervelle brûlée par la poudre
C’est encore loin l'Paradis?
Hé, c’est à combien l'Paradis?
Ce Monde me blesse la rétine
Me laisse aucuns choix d'la tétine à la tombe
À Dieu j'm’adresse certains soirs
Quand j'cherche un peu d'clarté, un sens à cette vie
J'me remémore le quartet, naissance, école, boulot et mort
Où est ma place, mon camp ici, croyant ou athé'?
J'suis à l’abri des missiles, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’ai porté ma croix, maté mon côté sombre, et les trois six
Ecarté le mal, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’suis là, assis seul dans les ténèbres, braquant le ciel du regard
On a l’art d'pisser la douleur quand on est nègre
Le bien a déserté l’écran, on célèbre nos noces de feu
L’argent veut assassiner Dieu, le trône est vacant
Sur toutes les lèvres, on lit la même prière
Mais si on vise
Si l'Tout-Puissant est amour, pourquoi sa parole divise?
Le Monde est à nous, vu qu’on y vit
J'veux crever l’arme au poing et pas à genoux
C’est réel, c’est pas MTV
Y'a rien d'glamour mais j'relativise
J’avoue, la vie, elle a un drôle de sens de l’humour
Parfois, l'long du tunnel, on voit pas l'bout, mec, dans l'ghetto, on craque
Destin tracé comme le fœtus d’une mère défoncée au crack
La foi dans l'Créateur, pas en l’homme et ses légions
Mal comprise, religion devient arme de destruction massive
Ta guerre c’est un braquo, déguisé en juge de cause
Un ange qui ment sous serment, des mômes qu’on arrose pour des gisements d'brut
J'te cause de rêves qui s’écroulent comme les Tours Jumelles
Cette pute de liberté qui perd son rimmel
Dans les rivières d'la haine, coule le sang des martyrs
Quand la peur gagne par KO, la morale repart en civière
Proche du chaos, mon cœur abrite le feu de Lucifer
Mais là-haut, faudra s’y faire, on nous a laissés le libre-arbitre
C’est la canicule, tout s’agite, le Sud encule le Nord
Le sol rougit, on changera pas ce monde à moins d’un paquet d'millions de mort

Vivre et apprendre à mourir
Se battre, vaincre ou rendre les armes
Faire face ou passer son temps à courir

Donc j'dis vrai, on commence à l'sentir, le souffre
Livré à moi-même, j’ai appris à manœuvrer le mic au bord du gouffre
Dans c'putain de Monde, j’étouffe, alors j’écris
Souffle ma trentième de putain d'bougie dans les fourneaux de l’antéchrist
Si je l'bouffe le micro, c’est pour m’arracher autre part
J'commets des crimes musicaux pour arracher l'code barre

On revient jouer, c'est ta clarté pour ma noirceur
Les jambes écartées les MCs tiennent leur mic comme un vibromasseur
Avant qu'elle crève, ils enterrent notre zik
Avant que j'l'acheve mon sceud tourne déjà dans la chambre d'un internaute

J'suis pas une caille j'suis un cannibale, criminel avec une excuse
Parce que mes chances de survie sont très minces
J'ai une méchante envie de jouer avec le feu en me servant de tes mains
Dans le noir j'roule sans feu, le beat j'viens fusiller

Faut sortir de là, prendre les clés du maton

Essayer de garder le moral même derrière des barreaux
Connaître le passé, et au présent renaître
C’est les bif’ qui font courir les gens
Où est l’esclave, où est le maître?
Un spliff, un bon à mettre dans le poste et j’quitte ma taule
Esquive le réel, j’vis entre l’enclume et le marteau
Innonde les ruelles, les ondes, je les cribles
Devenir l’inverse de ce qui divise le monde, c’est ça, être libre",Chant Libre,2006
Lino,"Tant que y aura des putes, des macs
Des buts à atteindre, des plaques à prendre
Des paquets de gens qui luttent pour une cause
Des parquets, des jeunes qui chutent aux assises
Tant qu'il reste des minutes avant que ça explose
Tant qu'y aura des banques à braquer
Des tas de choses à dire, des raisons de craquer
De partir en couille en martyr
Tant que y aura des tas de douilles encore fumantes sur le sol
Des patrouilles, tant qu'on aura que la violence comme argument
Tant qu'ils auront pas ma dépouille et que pour se faire entendre faudra se taper
Tant que y aura des ""nègres"" et des ""crouilles"" j'aurai de quoi rapper
On passe pas entre les gouttes, on se mouille
C'est en temps d'paix que l'embrouille se prépare, on sait pas ramper
Tant qu'on dépouillera nos bleds, tant que y aura des délits de sales têtes
Tant qu'on annulera pas la dette de l'Afrique
Tant que la France sera pas prête à voir des tas de bronzés dans son écran
Tant que Marianne m'aura pas astiqué la trique
Tant que rien n'aura changé, chez nous on rêve d'ici
La misère shoot, on a retrouvé le cadavre d'un môme planqué dans la soute
On nous a mutilé
Qui peut l'ignorer?
Suffit pas de décorer le tirailleur pour oublier Goré
Tant que y aura pas de justice en ce qui nous concerne, pas d'unité
Quand on tombe on prend du ferme on a pas l’immunité
Tant que y aura des ghettos dans nos villes, dans nos crânes
Tant qu'ils se rendront compte qu'on existe seulement quand le coin crame
T'as toujours pas compris que nos drapeaux doivent émerger
Petit mouton sors du troupeau assassine le berger
Tant qu'on aura pas le respect qu'on mérite j'rapperai comme un Uzi chante
Je ferai de la musique délinquante

Ce son reflète l'époque, des bloc c'est la bande son

Délinquante musique

Tant que le président évitera le placard
Évident, tant que je sortirai pas sans blinder le trois quart
Tant qu'on se fera flinguer, tiré à vue de dos ou de trois quarts
Et que j'aurai du mal à distinguer meurtre et bavure
C'est Lima, India, November, Oscar
Pas une gravure de mode, je suis l'image de la haine
Lascar, sur une prod' animale
Que Dieu nous parraine, mon vacarme, ma rime me sortent de l'anonymat
Un mauvais climat règne, on marine dans de l’éther
L'audimat pète, ça saigne comme Tony les narines pleines de coke
On nous enseigne l'art de courber l'échine
Dès le premier biberon à devenir des carburant pour la machine
""Seuls les forts vivront""
Imagine la scène, tant que j'y croirai, qu'un seul vienne les autres suivront
Tant que y aura ces veines que le sort tranche, ces chaînes à nos poignets
De la blanche, de l'héro de la fonce-dé pour s'éloigner
Tant qu'on sera au point zéro à pisser dans la guitare
Tant que y aura des putains de matons, des frères au mitar
Des mères au parloir, des pères brisés, condition trop sale
Visés par la loi, handicapés social
Tant qu'on sera autant à l'aise dans ce ""biz"" que dans le comico
Ils préféreraient me voir avec un flingue plutôt qu'un micro
Tant que y aura le bordel ou ça schlingue
Mon son ira immortel sur disque dingue
Je suis en mode guerre comme en Iraq
Les MC ont de la bile à se faire, regardez vos montres
J'reprends les affaires, et j'm'appuie sur un beat monstre
Tant que j'aurai pas le respect que je mérite j'rapperai comme un Uzi chante

Lyrics marginaux des taudis, permets que je me fasse une dédicace
La roue tourne, c’est un casino, la vie, c’est ce qu’on dit
On passe par les cuisines de l’enfer pour se poser au paradis
Saisis nos rimes, cousine, écoute mon cœur causer
A chaque prestation, les ondes, je reviens arroser
Les mecs, c’est des pulsations cardiaques, ces kits de batterie
A chaque, poum poum tchak, après l’impact, crie
Je sors de ma crypte, largue le truc
Sur ma vague, viens surfer, c’est réel, c’est pas un clip
On sait pas bluffer, c’est le langage du cœur

On parle le langage du cœur, jamais à demi-mot
Oui tu sais, le langage du cœur fait souvent défaut
(C'est réel, Wallen, L.I.N.O.)
Oui, tu vois, le langage du cœur ne se traduit pas
(On bluffe pas), tu auras beau tendre l'oreille
Soit tu piges, soit tu piges pas

On parle le langage du cœur, ça n’engage que moi
Ma clique, mon microphone, Wallen te le dit dans les chœurs
En cage après 2002, mon adrénaline fuse
J’en ai pour qui veut, sur la ligne, je reste, ma rage, on diffuse
L’instru', je le câline pas, je refuse de me coucher
T’amuses ta galerie, t’es de la baise, excuse, ma langue a fourché
J’apaise tes douleurs en kickant loin des clichés
Expliquant aux petits que c’est l’heure, qu’on a assez négligé le fond
Affiché sur les murs en posters ou niché dans les sonos
Reste toi-même les vrais gangsters font pas de promo
Obligé de le pisser, je peux pas le taire
J’ai que 12 mesures chrono, je termine en espérant que t’aies pigé le truc
C’est le langage du cœur

Lino,"Les putains de jours passent et se ressemblent
Les tours cachent l’horizon, les spliffs tournent, rassemblent
On fait ses classes dans les cours de prisons
Les soces, la famille, disons que les grosses liasses stimulent
Enterre les amis, souvent on y passe mais la vie continue
Un putain de vice peut en cacher un autre
Il dissimule sa haine, la reum elle, la rue lui a déjà prit un fils
Le daron lui parle comme il cogne mais à force on s’habitue
Sent plus les coups, le cœur béton comme un bout de bitume
Il tue le temps, à moins que ce soit le contraire
Avec ses confrères, dans le crime, il tombe dans tous les pièges que la rue tend
Gratte deux trois rimes de quartiers, sur les shmits et l’état
Enragé, une moitié du temps, et l’autre pété au shit
Il a des rêves, pourtant, des envies d’exil
Guette la carte du monde, relit les lettres de son frangin au placard
Ça dit le vrai luxe c’est être libre, l’homme est pas fait pour la cage
Personne n’est parfait, comme leur dernier braquage
Alors il gamberge, en nage, allongé sur son lit superposé
Pense à changer de berge, les yeux explosés, il pense

Il se lève, prends son ? sous le lit, enroulé dans une veste
Sourit à sa mère, lui fait un geste de la main
Claque la porte, rejoint le reste de l’équipe
Les potes, ça s’engraine, les voix portent, putain venez on sait ou cette pute traîne
La daronne, guette par la fenêtre, regarde son fils partir
Cette nuit, c’est la dernière fois qu’elle entendra parler de lui

Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?

Elle a l’âge des premières fois, l’âge où on teste la vie
L’âge où on aime autant qu’on se déteste
L’âge où le seul avis qu’on aie, c’est celui des autres
Tous dans le même navire, elle était cool avant que sa reum perde les eaux
Tout s’écroule quand ses parents divorcent, les coups
Les rapports de force, plus personne à l’écoute car plus de réseau
Adolescence meurtrie, cicatrice ambulante
Le cœur blessé, prend le premier petit con venu pour une ambulance
Une vie stressée, sans but, sans tarder
Elle donne son petit corps à qui sait la regarder, et encore
C’est une grande pute la vie, elle assemble ses putains d’souvenirs
Elle se rappelle, les nombreuses visites nocturnes
De papa dans sa chambre
Et elle fume, fait le mur, enrage, déjà mure avant l’âge
Attend sa mue après l’orage, ça ne peut qu’être mieux
Elle tombe accro d’un raclo plein de promesses
Tout est OK, jusqu’au jour où elle lui annonce qu’elle est cloquée
Le jour de ses 18 piges, tout est noir ce soir de décembre
On l’a retrouvée dans sa baignoire, baignant dans son sang

Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?
Où vont les anges?

Il a le poing tranché, des gouttes de sang viennent tacher le sol
Encore une gorgée d’alcool, encore un cachet
Chargé, il guette son visage déformé dans la glace brisée
C’était le fils sage, désormais ses putains de démons le suivent à la trace
D’un monde aseptisé, pousser à réussir très tôt
A viser le top, à vivre les rêves de ses parents, leur véto, oui il en crève
Gosse transparent, éternel premier de la classe
Tout part en couille et se casse, personne n’a rien vu venir
Il se fracasse la tête contre les murs
Passe la plupart du temps seul devant sa glace
Genre, c’est à moi que tu parles?
Génération X, héritier de la violence des aînés
Une étincelle sur une traînée de poudre qui voulait juste être aimée
Des années, à kiffer sur une fouf qui s’en branle, l’étouffe
Il s’en prend à dieu, prie le diable, s’imaginant à deux dans le gouffre
Il a des pulsions meurtrières et veut sortir des ténèbres
Le souffre douleur d’hier, deviendra célèbre
Tristement, Le poing tranché, des gouttes de sang sur le sol
Encore une gorgée d’alcool, encore un cachet
Les armes chargées de son daron, entassées dans un sac de sport
Il se dirige vers son lycée pour inverser le score
Il arrive, pointe une première cible, et la ça tourne au drame
Et la suite, elle fera la une des journaux

Pour les gosses d’ici, de là-bas, du bled, ou d’ailleurs
Quartiers difficiles ou pas, j’plaide
Qui est coupable quand ça tourne au drame, que le coup part
Y’a même des SOS, dans les cocktails molotov

Lino,"Simples maillons, on est c'que la vie veut qu'nous soyons
Nous sommes des bêtes de somme, maîtres ou esclaves, en somme
Simples lettres, petites ou grosses sommes
Amis ou traîtres, ennemis, peut-être
Ou tout simplement des hommes?
Des âmes perdues sans guides
Nos armes braquent le bonheur, Sésame s’ouvre
Comme la trappe sous nos pieds précipite mon corps dans le vide
Nos Dieux sont en papier et c’est leur amour qui nous suicide
On est frappés par la foudre, comme conduits par un fou
Rattrapés par nos démons, la cervelle brûlée par la poudre
C’est encore loin l'Paradis?
Hé, c’est à combien l'Paradis?
Ce Monde me blesse la rétine
Me laisse aucuns choix d'la tétine à la tombe
À Dieu j'm’adresse certains soirs
Quand j'cherche un peu d'clarté, un sens à cette vie
J'me remémore le quartet, naissance, école, boulot et mort
Où est ma place, mon camp ici, croyant ou athé'?
J'suis à l’abri des missiles, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’ai porté ma croix, maté mon côté sombre, et les trois six
Ecarté le mal, mais jusqu’à quand?
J’suis là, assis seul dans les ténèbres, braquant le ciel du regard
On a l’art d'pisser la douleur quand on est nègre
Le bien a déserté l’écran, on célèbre nos noces de feu
L’argent veut assassiner Dieu, le trône est vacant
Sur toutes les lèvres, on lit la même prière
Mais si on vise
Si l'Tout-Puissant est amour, pourquoi sa parole divise?
Le Monde est à nous, vu qu’on y vit
J'veux crever l’arme au poing et pas à genoux
C’est réel, c’est pas MTV
Y'a rien d'glamour mais j'relativise
J’avoue, la vie, elle a un drôle de sens de l’humour
Parfois, l'long du tunnel, on voit pas l'bout, mec, dans l'ghetto, on craque
Destin tracé comme le fœtus d’une mère défoncée au crack
La foi dans l'Créateur, pas en l’homme et ses légions
Mal comprise, religion devient arme de destruction massive
Ta guerre c’est un braquo, déguisé en juge de cause
Un ange qui ment sous serment, des mômes qu’on arrose pour des gisements d'brut
J'te cause de rêves qui s’écroulent comme les Tours Jumelles
Cette pute de liberté qui perd son rimmel
Dans les rivières d'la haine, coule le sang des martyrs
Quand la peur gagne par KO, la morale repart en civière
Proche du chaos, mon cœur abrite le feu de Lucifer
Mais là-haut, faudra s’y faire, on nous a laissés le libre-arbitre
C’est la canicule, tout s’agite, le Sud encule le Nord
Le sol rougit, on changera pas ce monde à moins d’un paquet d'millions de mort

Vivre et apprendre à mourir
Se battre, vaincre ou rendre les armes
Faire face ou passer son temps à courir
Embrasser l’enfer, lui sourire et succomber à ses charmes
Avancer les poings serrés dans c'Monde
Enterrer sa peine, contrôler son destin
Même si c’est pas ici, ou dans c'Monde
Moi j’y arriverai, même à dos d’un putain d'missile, c’est certain

J'reviens m'livrer, c’est Bors, j'reviens œuvrer
J'rappe comme avec un flingue sur la tempe, tu peux pas mentir
Donc j'dis vrai, on commence à l'sentir, le souffre
Livré à moi-même, j’ai appris à manœuvrer le mic au bord du gouffre
Dans c'putain de Monde, j’étouffe, alors j’écris
Souffle ma trentième de putain d'bougie dans les fourneaux de l’antéchrist
Si je l'bouffe le micro, c’est pour m’arracher autre part
J'commets des crimes musicaux pour arracher l'code barre

Tu t’équipes. En cas d'conflit, Monsieur Vengeance est pas rassasié

Fatigué d'être raide 8 jours sur 7
J'lâche des bijoux lyricaux
Et on retient que les putains de rimes où je pars en sucette
J'suis venu beugler dans le micro en live du peuple

On raque au futur michtons, n'oublie jamais l'habit n'fait pas le mac
J'suis fatigué d'entendre le même son, des rimes tendres l'industrie du disque
C'est le bifton et l'hamecon
Si t'étudies lâche pas arrache les diplômes
Marche pas avec les putes, guette les schmits si tu deales
Icône des sous-sols, idylle entre acier et soie

Par ce qu' les ennemis ne changent pas

Graver mon timbre de voix

Madness, madness, war

Night number one was in Brixton
Sofrano B sound system
I'm was a-beatin' up the riddim with a fire
I'm comin' down his reggae reggae wire
It was a sound checkin' down your spinal column
A bad music tearin' up your flesh
And the rebels dem start a fighting
De youth dem just tun wild, it's
War amongs' the rebels
Madness, madness, war

Night number two down at Sheppard's
Right up Railton road
It was a night name friday when ev'ryone was high on brew or drew (?)
A pound or two worth of Kali 
Sound comin' down of the king's music iron
The riddim just bubblin' an' backfirin'
Ragin' an' risin'
When suddenly the music cut -
Steelblade drinkin' blood in darkness, it's
War amongs' the rebels
Madness, madness, war

Night number three, over the river
Right outside the Rainbow
Inside James Brown was screamin soul
Outside the rebels were freezin' cold
Babylonian tyrants descended
Bounced on the brothers who were bold 
So with a flick of the wris', a jab and a stab
The song of hate was sounded
The pile of oppression was vomited
And two policemen wounded
Righteous, righteous war

Night number four at the blues dance, abuse dance
Two rooms packed and the pressure pushin' up
Hot, hotheads

Linton Kwesi Johnson,"To us
Who were
Of necessary birth
For the earths hard
And thankless toil
Silence has no meaning

There is never a feeling
Of tranquility
Or mere quietness
Never a moment
Of soundless calm
From within or without
Our troubled selves

How can the clamor
Of sounds be stilled?
There is no void where
Noises can collect
And be made mute

How indeed
Can there be silence

When our hearts beat out
A sonorous beat
Meeting the beating drums
Of an African past
When our eyes shed
Solid tears of iron blood
That falls on concrete ground

Inside our ears
Are the many wailing cries
Of misery
Inside our bodies
The internal bleeding
Of volcanoes
Inside our heads
The wrapped in thoughts
Of rebellion

How can there be calm
When the storm is yet to come?

This unending silence
Taut, impervious, unbending
Not lending an ear
To the most delicate of sounds
Awaits the blast of bombs
Which man will explode
To break this silent bond
To (?)
To the use to create
Hills of soft obedience
Where sweet-clothed sounds
Can rebound
And their echoes glide
Like a carefree bird
In rhythmic calm
To a mellow
Pure, silent space",Two Sides of Silence,1980

Or who di first one to attack or if the human race

For those whom is aware
Them life already coming like a nightmare

The famine and the fear
The doubt and the drought
Desperation and despair
And you can see it all around

Lots of time to spend with you

We can hear the sound of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do

Come hold me in your arms
I love you

The water gets a little colder
And the sharks are all playing to win

Why don't we talk a little while

Tu t'en fous tant qu'ta montre est faite d'or
T'es là depuis le landau, au fond d'toi tu rêve de bouger

On tourne en rond dans un carré
Un peu comme les Cheerios
Quand j'vois l'ambiance dans mon quartier j'ai l'impression d'être dans la série Oz
Tout c'qu'on demande c'est d'être en paix
Il y a que devant Dieu qu'on s'agenouille mais pour d'l'argent j’t'ai vu ramper

Chamillionaire..listen

Ay, My father was Muslim my momma's a Christian
I couldn't even look surprised when they said they was splittin'
Wasn't no bacon or grits in, off in the kitchen
It was missin', plate was full of non-nutrition
I was born skinny the hunger was forced in me
To get angry at my lifestyle, no smile wasn't born friendly
Born with a thorn in me, I'm scorned so I'm pourin' Remi
I'm thinkin' that's boys feel me, but boys is avoidin' me
Oh, got to excuse me for givin' you the truth
And being the type to give proof that you givin' an excuse
You gotta excuse me for gettin' in the booth,
and keepin' it real about life while you livin' in the poof...
fantasy, damnit he, isn't as big a man as me
If I tell him the truth he need to hear then he gettin' mad at me
The truth could hit ya as hard as assault & battery,
and make people that used to run with me switch up and challenge me
But ain't we family? y'all forgettin' what y'all were
Forget what ya boy heard, 'cause this is 'bout more words
It's all 'bout communication but niggas ignore verbs
If ya boy shouted I'm hatin', then that got ya boy served
Don't deny it if you a man, so you should be man enough

Look a fan in the face and ask em' ""Are you a true fan or what""?
""Are you really a fan of us""? or are you type to switch
and get pissed and bootleg the disc 'cause I'm not, droppin' em' quick
They love ya and then they diss, they hug ya and then they hiss
They happy when you arrive and go right back to being pissed
Honestly man, I don't really even give a damn
Instead of being who you want me to be I be who I'am
I'm livin' life of my family and live life of Cham'
I don't live life for my fans
And don't, switch up my words just let me explain my thought
I appreciate ya support, I appreciate if ya bought,
my cd's with all ya heart but this music is just an art
But it's not as precious as life in the middle is where I'm caught
Lookin' out for my people, my motive is never evil
My motive was never see-through, my motive was always equal
Outsiders would lie and try to promote it they out (to) decieve you
They give a notice to you, but don't give a notice to me too
Ya, that's somethin' I call divide and conquer
They try to get inside the monster to divide the monster
So they can become the monster, then they'll try to stomp ya
Inside the circle of friends is where you'll find imposters

Yet in sight could it be? it's the end of all light

Scorched by the fire, wings are burning

Descending and now as they fall from
Grace we pray and start repenting the

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know

I can't believe that you're in love with me.",I Can't Believe That You're in Love With Me,
Lionel Hampton,"Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

(Oh) how I wish I could forget those
(Those) happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
(In) spite of all (that) I do
(And) everything seems to bring
Memories of you",Memories of You,
Lionel Hampton,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
and the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust
in your hair 
And starlight in your eyes 
Like they do

That is why all the guys in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

If only for a minute
I'd settle for an hour
And if you could stay just for one day
That would make me so happy happy baby

See, it won't hurt to give our love a try
Girl don't you pass me by
'Cause I'm that kind of guy
who's going to love and treat you like a queen

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Come a little closer baby
Lay your head up on my shoulder baby
Boy you know I can't deny it
You done already set my soul on fire

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you",Close to You,
Lionel Hampton,"The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean,
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me,
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you,
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I'd come running back for more

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue,
You'll know how much this heart of my is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I cried for you

Yes, everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool",Everybody's Somebody's Fool,

Yes, you sure did treat me nice
Well, gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now, now I'm living in paradise
Welll, I'm feeling, feeling mighty fine, got good music on my radio
Yes, I'm feeling, feeling fine, got good music on my radio
Well, I want love to kiss you baby, while you're standing 'neath the mistletoe

Well, Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Won't, won't you please hear my plea

Lionel Hampton,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You [*],
Lionel Hampton,"I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1955
Lionel Hampton,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again

Lionel Hampton,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)

There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1955
Lionel Hampton,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,1956
Lionel Hampton,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Lionel Hampton,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining
I'm certain the sun will shine

I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?

Where'd ya get those eyes?",Jeepers Creepers,1956
Lionel Hampton,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Lionel Hampton,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire,1956
Lionel Hampton,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

Lionel Hampton,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1956
Lionel Hampton,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1956
Lionel Hampton,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon,1957
Lionel Hampton,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1957
Lionel Hampton,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1957
Lionel Hampton,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die.

Lionel Hampton,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

It is seldom that a dream comes true

That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

But I can't remember where or when

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1958

Lionel Hampton,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust/Moonglow,1982

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Lionel Hampton,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned

No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?

It is time for a holiday

Come to the cabaret!
Come taste the wine
Come hear the band 
Come blow that horn
Start celebrating
Right this way your table´s waiting
What good´s permitting some prophet of doom?
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret , old chum!
So come to the cabaret!
I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours
The day she died the neighbors
Came to snicker her
Well, that is what comes from 
Too much pills and liquor
But when I saw her laid down like  a queen
She was the happiest corpse I´d ever seen
I think of Elsie till this very day
I remember how she´d turned to me and say
What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!
And as for me 
And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea

The longer I stay away

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes

Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear

There I go talking out of my head again so baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane

Won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet

Lionel Hampton,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2008

Je l'dois au mauvais temps, je l'dois à Jupiter
Il me tomba d'un ciel d'orage

Par un soir de novembre, à cheval sur les toits
Un vrai tonnerr' de Brest, avec des cris d'putois
Allumait ses feux d'artifice
Bondissant de sa couche en costume de nuit
Ma voisine affolée vint cogner à mon huis
En réclamant mes bons offices

"" Je suis seule et j'ai peur, ouvrez-moi, par pitié

Contraint d'coucher dehors quand il fait mauvais temps
Pour la bonne raison qu'il est représentant
D'un' maison de paratonnerres ""

Erreur on ne peut plus funeste

Quand Jupiter alla se faire entendre ailleurs
La belle, ayant enfin conjuré sa frayeur
Et recouvré tout son courage
Rentra dans ses foyers fair' sécher son mari
En m'donnant rendez-vous les jours d'intempérie
Rendez-vous au prochain orage

A partir de ce jour j'n'ai plus baissé les yeux
J'ai consacré mon temps à contempler les cieux
A regarder passer les nues
A guetter les stratus, à lorgner les nimbus
A faire les yeux doux aux moindres cumulus
Mais elle n'est pas revenue

Son bonhomm' de mari avait tant fait d'affair's
Tant vendu ce soir-là de petits bouts de fer
Qu'il était dev'nu millionnaire

Lionel Hampton & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996

Things I was thinking of.

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999

Lionel Hampton & His Star Jazz Inner Circle,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,1999

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

I see the tears you cry.
I see the pain that's in your eyes.
So many times you were so lonely.
And no one seemed to care.

Are drowning in your sorrows.
Know your heart will show you the way.

Are you trying to find a beginning.
Or something just to hold on to.
Always know that love will find a way.

Is it hard this life you're living.
Does the world seem so unkind.
Don't you worry love will find a way.

Some say we've lost, our way.
Some say the world has gone astray.

That's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say I'll show you

Say you, say me it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, Oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing oh yes
Believing who you are
You are a shining star

Oh that's the way it should be

The colors you should wear

Is just a game of solitaire

Climbing to the top
The ones you love will come and go
When you lose you sacrifice
Chasing the rainbow
And if you should climb this magic ladder
The story will unfold
Just remember when you reach the top
All that glitters is not gold

Time, just take the time

I guess only the strong survive
I just gotta tell you baby

[Chorus]
Sometimes love can be so cruel
Sometimes we learn 'bout being a fool
I don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long
It may be the water
That keeps us strong

I took for granted that you'd always be there
I know it seemed at times I didn't care
I didn't know what you had given me
But with love it takes some time
But through the joy and pain, you're mine
I just gotta tell you baby

[Chorus]

It may be the water
That keeps us strong
You know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby
That it all turned out this way, ?cause you know that
It almost slipped away, oh baby
But we managed to stay alive
I guess only the strong survive
I just gotta tell you baby

[Chorus]

You know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby
That it all turned out this way, cause you know that
It almost slipped away, oh baby
But we managed to stay alive
I guess we found that only the strong survive
So I just had to tell you baby

That keeps us strong",It May Be the Water,2001
Lionel Richie,"Every night and every day my heart feels the pain 
I wake up to the thought of you and I call your name 
No one ever made me feel the way you do 
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you 
But now I've got to let go 

We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, my tender heart 
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again 
With my tender heart. 
We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad 
Knowing that I'm not the one you want 
I can't hold on to my tender heart 

I never thought I'd be the one who would play the fool 
But I know love can feel so good and can be so cruel 
It's clear to me the writing is on the wall 
It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all 
And I can't go on this way 

We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, my tender heart 
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again 
With my tender heart. 
We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad 
Knowing that I'm not the one you want 
I can't hold on to my tender heart 

I'm standing at the door 
Don't need this hurt no more 
I'm crying out in vain 
Cause you don't feel my pain. 

Maybe it was always going to be this way 
Maybe I'll look back and understand some day 
But now I've got to say 
We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, my tender heart 
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again 
With my tender heart. 
We don't stand a chance 
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad 
Knowing that I'm not the one you want 
I can't hold on to my tender heart

With you, goodbye, cause I don't need you with me
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good
Were wasted time, and it's all because of you

I was blind, couldn't see the writing on the wall
In my mind, you were the only one to be with me
I can't believe, that it took so long to figure out
The games you play, now the truth is clear I have no doubt

People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me

Say you, say me; say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me; say it together

Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand, Some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you""

Say you, say me; say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me; say it together

So you think you know the answers - Oh no
Cause the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - Oh yes

You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely
Angel in disguise
With your power of love
You just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we have together
Only time will tell

Every day, every night
Oh, I know it's so right
When I see your face
Only time's gonna tell
But I know you so well
Girl, my love's for real

From the first time that I saw you
I know it was forever
This mighty love between us
Will keep us together
You're the girl God sent from heaven
I'm so glad I found you
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever
I'm so glad to be around you
You are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely
It's alright, it's alright
Do it again

For what we had, sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down
But then most of all, I do love you
Still
 
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see, but then
Most of all, I do love you",Still [Live],2004
Lionel Richie,"Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.

She can make me laugh when I want to cry (oh yeah)

You know it in the end you'd do it all again

Is too high to pay

(You can't help it you're feeling butterflies)
It's obvious
There's some chemistry
(I think I know why it feels so right)
Girl, I wanted so long to know
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go
(Don't tell me I have to start all over again)
I never thought this day would come
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(And you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)
What's inside of my heart
It ain't gonna change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it, I feel it, let's not pretend)

Baby, I don't know what love is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
'Cause they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love

It's so clear for you to see
(Don't let nobody tell you what to do)
Why they can't they just let us be happy
(I don't want to find somebody new)
If you know what's really in your heart
Then don't let them tear us apart
('Cause you feel it, I feel it, let's think this through)

Baby, I don't know what love is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm feeling

We have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go (We're in love)
And now that we know it's real
We are going to let it show
To the whole world
That I'm yours forever
And you're my girl

My pen and paper in hand 
To write to you 

To tell you what I feel inside 
To say to you I can't survive 
Without you 

For all the things I've come to see 
I now beleive there's only you 
Only you for me 

I'm standing here so lost in you 
That's all my heart and soul can do 
Is say what's true 

I love you 
I love you 

The first time I looked in your eyes 
It was so clear to my surprise 
My heart stood still 

I'v eheard it time and time again 
That when you fall you can't pretend 
True love is real 

I know with you I do belong 
You are my voice my simple song 
You're all I need 

The joy I feel when love is blind 
You're everything I need to find

I keep thinking there's one and they say us three

Started to converse and I sense a problem
And I'm thinking girl I can always solve them
But she didn't want to hear it
She says she is all mine and I can make him feel it
All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two

Baby, by the time you get this letter
I'll be gone
But I left something for you on the pillow
Put this tape in
Press play
I love you

It's four in the morning, I'm sitting here at night
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind
I'm leaving in an hour, and you won't be up in time to say goodbye, whoa
I'm putting this on tape (baby, you're wonderful)
I really mean it, babe (more than you will ever know)
I wish that I could stay (but I gotta go)
I'll be back, but in the meantime
Keep in mind

(What you are)
Something too big for words
And it's my pleasure to love you, baby, for better or worse

Sometimes, it slips my mind, so in case I forget
(Girl, you are) you're better than (anything)
I ever had
(You are) the perfect love
(Never give you up because you are) 
My heart, my soul, my breath
Take it all until there's nothing left
'Cause, baby, you are

Now, no man has ever loved his woman
More than I love you
Girl, you know it's true
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you
That ain't true (here's what I do)
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week
Take you shopping whenever
More importantly
Wrap my loving arms around you
To reassure everything I felt that first night
I feel it more

It's been that many years 
And still have to ask the same question 
Why? 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Funny me, funny you 
Don't have nothing lft in common 
You wanted me to have your heart 
Now you want it back 
What about the promise you made to me 
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason 
And suddenly we're flying high 
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast 
You're trying to get lost 
I'm trying to pull up 
And damn I can't say 
You said you didn't need me 
I really didn't think that you would leave me 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Now the kids are looking at me like I'm to blame 
No longer got their respect for me 
Don't want to hear what I'm saying 
I know how it feels to be ashamed 
Cause when I was young I felt that pain too 
And I can't say nothing that would cause you to make a change 
And that's the reason that we're going our separate ways 
Then who am I fooling 
What am I doing thinking you love me 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night 
Now it's so hard to find two words to say 

You would think by this time I would get it right 
Know the schemes and the things that make it be right 
When you said you could stay no longer 
I thought I had just a little more daylight 
LIke when we use to turn a fight into a good night 
I know the things I use to do to make you feel right 
I would give anything the fortune I made 
To bring back the days that the feeling was so right 

Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night 
When you and me would kiss at night 
Remember what we tripped like 
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night

He said, â??You haven't any place here
Why you show your face here?
I'll keep you at the base here
Don't move â??til you're told.â??
He returned with the command
â??Go back to your land. The only way to enter is with gold.â??

What you get is what you see not what they say (x5)
A promise in a second. The truth will take a day
To see the truth in every step along the way
Is like a child that learns to judge within his play

I want to turn my water to wine, but I'm not divine
So I must feel work to do it.
I want to turn their sorrow to salt, the weak to the strong
So we've got to think our way through it.
Closing in from all quarters. Pressure to achieve is like I'm forced to grow
All your sons and your daughters. They have to fight to keep the little that they know

I never wanted to be free until I knew I was in prison
I didn't know I was a key until I unlocked the pain in living'
I want to see the vegetation To inspire my vocation
To see the plans of every nation. Hear the words from their hearts.

Won't rest 'til the folks sing tunes from the heart string sounds from the true springs of our histories
Confessed let them come through lives that evade you born to renew and explain our mysteries
Your eyes won't lie when they're allowed to see
Your sun, your skies see that you're allowed to be
Your reason why so we're wise to take heed 
Your time, your earth, so plant your seeds (x3)
Plant your seeds [Repeat]",Straight at Yer Head,1995

Give her a proper Liverpool hand, you can do better than that
And now ladies and gentlemen, what you've been waiting for""

I've come a long way
You walked into my life
I was tired, in love like a fool
But I know it's gonna work out fine, yeah

I've never felt so good
I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now
No, no

I've heard some people say
So wrong, oh, so wrong
Do, do you want to know?
It's true, the touch of your hand, oh

I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now

Lionrock,"I won't say any words to you
All my thoughts are in front of you
See the body turn
Melt, like the candle burns

All the shadows dance in time to this
Every pain will find a seat in bliss
So what need for more
When the heart is sure?

Cling to vision
Now clear the conscious
Do your duties
Providing food for your families
Food for the body, food for the soul
Don't let depression come and take control
Energies project, let them protect you
Sound you perfect will not neglect you
Just sing out!",Call a Cab [*],1997
Lionrock,"Fall into line. I clocked the card today
Conveyor whizzes past my hands
The supervisor spies a quiet corner 
Thinks he better warn a peace says in his plans
Assemble pieces of the nucleic craze
Conveyor quizzes the pneumatic mind
And while we're working are we seeking different thoughts
Spinning wheels away the pennies we can find
Design the future from the scraps you find
Display emotion with a toxic bloom
The new machine is up and running now
And in less time it prints the labels, good as new
Overdue or over done, before we crawl we try to run
And that's the all we try to reach 
Before we learn we try to teach
A kind of dance-too close to find
Who sees the generation with their souls in mind?

We let off steam from the magnetic coil
Then we use a spark to raise the precious oil
The supervisor spies, the traffic queues
The news says we could loose while all the rivers boil
Should we leave them to devices, they would price things way too high
When I greet a man en route who claims I'm sentenced to comply
You're in the wrong zone. You've found the wrong place.
So take your dreams home. You need to interface.
And could you pull the thread unwrap the cloak to leave him bare?
See the truth before illusions that is in despair
A solid corpse, too sure to hide
Who shields the generations from the coming tide?

Opinions are opinions are opposed until they prove
But even when well founded the astounded won't be moved
So take the feeling high. Just let the feelings fly.
From macrocosm to the microscopic world of me
A force instills a life, who knows how long a life would be?
Envelope, attack, decay, release
We'll let this reign and thus sustain a kind of peace",Amazing New Product,1998
Lionrock,"She's here to test the future man
With x-ray eyes for every plan
Don't try to compromise her views
She'll win the day and make the news

Sometimes her cycle makes her sick
But she's too quick to keep it down
She's dressed for flight, the perfect night
A silver stream walked into town

And in her eyes 
A simple cure
For young or old, for rich or poor

When everything she saw was her and of her mind
Would she bathe in all what was good until all else believed she's blind
Making her choices with her emotions
She begged stability while she stirred the world's commotions

She was shocked. 
Door was locked.
Now it's opened up and pours the truth in to her cups

See... 
Life in the palm of her hands
Youth in the palm of her hands
Balance in the palm of her hands

Truth in the palm of her hands
Life in the palm of her hands
Youth in the palm of her hands
Balance in the palm of her hands
Truth in the palm of her hands

She lives her life the way it came
Summer's tease and learn to pain
Played her games in city streets
To taste the life she longed to keep

Sometimes her cycle made her sick 
But she was quick to keep her poise
She blew her top and caused a tidal wave to drown the world in noise
But in a thought, she would forgive
And granted need, to light, to live",She's on the Train,1998
Lionrock,"Listen ends again into the desert street, 
A strange kind of violence
And like a legend creeping down the alleyways, 
It waves a hand to silence
All though we're not aware, there is a presence there 
Until we hear them teasing
Spitting curses, verses from the sacred books of long forgotten reason
Silken suits, the clicks of heels, 
The midnight hour long decayed
The spirit moves till busker plays 
Till he wishes he could never played
But the street wise listen 
While the wet roads glisten
Don't know what you're missing

I wouldn't carry you through this tonight 
But the melody's here and the beats are all right
And though there's a risk from the street hood, 
In the mist of the rain we can feel good
All though we're not aware, 
There is a presence there, 
Until we see teasing
Stealing time in motor grime working like a lamp through the vampire season

Heaven, soothe, power versus dancers in to a groove
Moves through the inner sun with shinning proof
You've carried all the blessing you can see 
That you were getting what you fear
Love lies close to all the hate you could've reared
Blue skies always under cloud that disappears
You've died too, but wrong thing, hear the song bring proof
Under life's wing, many cycling truth

A lover's fight, the blues patrol, 
She tries to keep the cash she made
Out on the streets since twilight, 
Now she's wishing that she never stayed
But the street wise listen 
While the wet roads glisten
Don't know what you're missing

Boys from the bar spilling out
Climbs into the car without a shadow of a doubt
Boys hit a drunk on the street, 
Passenger screams as he flies from the seat
Lives in a tangle or worse, 
Lift from the pipe of the night in a hearse
Lives in a gamble or more, 
A lift from the plain day
A lift from the plain day

And the truth will set you free
From the broken lamp lying at the corner of a memory
Treasures to be found
Yes this is your town [Repeat x2]
I guess this is your town
Yes this is your town",Wet Roads Glisten,1998

Liquid,"I'm from the ghetto where kids don't play
From the land where they use slang you won't say
City of gangstas and brotherly love
City of hustlers and suffering thugs

But there's a sign of life in our youth
They look up to the things we do
Teach them to love and we can't lose
Help them to find the right path to choose

Every day there's a struggle here
Life's a crack house socked in tears
Church a packed house covered in fear
God love reigns down on His children

And everyday a life is thrown away
When everyday there's a life to gain
Christ accepts all sinners the same
Men and women just reaching for change

I'm from the ghetto, I'm from the gutter where it all goes down
And in the ghetto is where the Most High change me around
We've been praying and I think we see now
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it

I'm from the ghetto where stars are born
Record deals no sales leave young men scorned
Little women with big women bodies make them feel grown
You cast the first stone

Seventeen of the grind a formality
Cutting school smoking weed a reality
Little babies having babies it's so sad to see
Men and women of the church are taking back the streets

I'm from the ghetto, I'm from the gutter where it all goes down
And in the ghetto is where the Most High change me around
We've been praying and I think we see now
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it

I'm from the ghetto where guns are used by
Little ones that are often abused
20/20's Badlands the news consist of thugs
But Christians live here too, let's change

I'm from the ghetto, I'm from the gutter where it all goes down
And in the ghetto is where the Most High change me around
We've been praying and I think we see now
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it

If I ever make it out the hood congratulate me
Lately I've been feeling like I'm trapped here
Last year feels like the other day
And another day goes by but it's the same thing

What can I do different, how can I make a change?
Feels like a deja vu but still I maintain
Feels like I paid my dues when I was eighteen
Would my music appeal to you if I was mainstream?

Woke up this morning looked around my cell
Can't believe I get to leave today
Thank the Lord Jesus Christ the most high
I started to cry as I prayed

I can't wait to walk with my son
And see the big smile on his face
And make up for every single day
That I was gone

I said peace to my mans in C block
Fam in E block and Pastor James
I couldn't believe that the time was coming
I would finally be on my way

I never thought that I'd leave here breathing
But thank God for my faith
I took one last look at the yard
I took one last look at the guard
And said I'm ready to go

Oh, I was locked down, hopeless until You looked my way
I was doubtful that You would forgive a man like me
You are the reason that I can finally say
That I'm free

I spoke to the guard said, ""I'm leaving a new man""
Shook his right hand then I headed for the front gate
I could see my son jumping for joy
I smiled back at the guard and said that's my boy

I hugged my son with a knot in my throat
Thanked my wife for all the letters she wrote
For staying with me through this four and a half
For being a mother, for being a dad

I said, ""Thank you baby for sticking with me through these hard times
Sorry baby for every single night I made you cry""
She said, ""Don't worry I'm just glad your alive
Ready to start brand new and push the old to the side""

Thank You Lord I couldn't thank You more
For everything You've done in my life
I praise You Lord, I couldn't repay You Lord
For keeping me alive, it's good to be back babe

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
When you met her
She was right so thick
Something better then a wife, no glitch
She won't stop ever, but she might go click
If you leave her you'll see a PSYCHO BITCH
Now she's callin your crib, at nights so sick
Wanna pop up and try ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbitt, Told her to slice yo dick
If you Ever break up with a Psycho bitch

[Verse I: Tech N9ne]
Don't give me that shit
But a nigga don't care, never could it be fair
Then I was up in a middle lover
Came a double dare when
I woke up
I was in a Mutha fuckin nightmare
How you ganna fuck me on Sunday
Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
You buggin,
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off in your lovin'
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If sleep, don't leave it on, nigga, for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about menace
And now never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel, and selects
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yea
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Don't go thought with it
Be throught with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it.
You thinking you know women and your just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga,
That in back,
At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch

Lookin for white bitch hair on my balls
Trippin with chu

Fuck with a bitch is definite
Better watch who you stepping with
Fuck attention deficit
Better watch who the fuck you messin with
Just because I Fucked you that don't mean we getting married hoe
The way you sit around the corner from my house is scary though
Psycho bitch is when it comes to relationships are very slow
Bet chya'll never understand it's over till your buried Low
Oh, No
Don't me up on the myspace flippin out
Trippin with strippers you think I'm digging out
Me sayin that ""I'll never be taken by the hands of another man""

[Liquid Assassin:]
She's so sick with it, I stick hit it, and dick fit it
Never did I think for a minute to quit, quit it
Chickens on the livin, and trippin to get hit it
Turn around flip and then get you into deep shitted
Pussy was imbedded and get it your indebted
You could make a penny or money the man said it
You can run a bitch by adjusting the antennas
But if she demand it your betta forget it
She's Psycho like Michael
You might go and wake up to knives and rifles
When your eyes closed she's liable
Like I know to move on you like Tae Bo
Even I know this sly hoe like rivals
Been turn you into five-Oh
Either that and your turn your back
And the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
Should have listen to phone call, just stop with them harassing threats
My envision was them draws and me plottin on having sex
Got me trippin, fist in a ball

I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out.

He said, ""Tell me all your thoughts on God.
And tell me, am I very far?""

On our way, the sun broke free of the clouds.
We count only blue cars skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions like children often do.

We said, ""Tell me all your thoughts on God,
'Cause I'd really like to meet her.
And ask her why we're who we are.""

Tell me all your thoughts on God,
'Cause I'm on my way to see her.
So tell me, am I very far,
Am I very far now

It's getting cold, picked up the pace.
How our shoes make hard noises in this place.
Our clothes are stained, we pass the money, cross our people
And ask many questions like children often do.

We said, Tell me all your thoughts on God,
'Cause I'd really like to meet her.
And ask her why we're who we are.

Tell me all your thoughts on God,
