Steve Howe,"Sister bluebird flying high above
Shine your wings forward to the sun
Hide the mysteries of life on your way
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
What you don't know, I have never heard

Starship trooper, go sailing on by
Catch my soul, catch the very night
Hide the moment from my eager eyes
Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul
What you can't see, can't be very whole

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
Setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughters 
That in the knowledge of the land 
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Mother life, hold firmly on to me
Catch my knowledge higher than the day
Lose as much as only you can show
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
What I don't know, I have never shared

Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the fact there shown before you
Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
As I see a new day in me, I can also show if you and you may follow

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
Setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughters 
That in the knowledge of the land 
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways",Starship Trooper: Life Seeker/Disillusion/Würm,1981
Steve Howe,"I awoke this morning
Love laid me down by a river.
Drifting I turned on upstream
Bound for my forgiver.
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.
Sound did silence me
Leaving no trace.
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.

He spoke of lands not far
Or lands they were in his mind.
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time.
In no time at all he took me to the gate.
In haste I quickly checked the time.
If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.
Had to hear your wonderous stories.

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing your wonderous stories.
Hearing your wonderous stories.
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there to stand
So cautiously at first and then so high.
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories.
Return to hear your wonderous stories.

Hearing,
Hearing,

Steve Howe,"Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human race,
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place,
If the summer change to winter, yours is no disgrace

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are,
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are,
Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far,
Lost in musing circumstances, that's just where you are

Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human race,
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place,
If the summer change to winter, yours is no, 
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace

Death defying, mutilated armies scatter the earth,
Crawling out of dirty holes, their morals, 
Their morals disappear

Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human, silly human race,
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place,

Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace

Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far,
Lost in musing circumstances, that's just where you are",Yours Is No Disgrace,1981
Steve Howe,"You better leave my kitten all alone, 
You better leave my kitten all alone. 
But I told you big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone. 

You better leave my kitten all alone, 
You better leave my kitten all alone. 
This dog is gonna get you 
If you don't leave her alone. 

Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you 
On the top of your head. 
That child is gonna miss you, 
You gonna wish that you were dead. 
If you don't leave my kitten all alone. 
Well I told you big fat bulldog, 
You better leave her alone.

Steve Howe,"My white bicycle, my white bicycle
                                                  
Riding all around the street
Four o'clock and they're all asleep
I'm not tired and it's so late
Moving fast everything looks great.

My white bicycle, my white bicycle

See that man, he's all alone
Looks so happy but he's far from home
Ring my bell, smile at him
Better kick over his garbage bin

My white bicycle, my white bicycle

The rain comes down but I don't care
The wind is blowing in my hair
Seagulls flying in the air

My white bicycle, my white bicycle

Policeman shouts but I don't see him
They're one thing I don't believe in
To find some charge but it's not leavin'

Lift both hands, his head in disgrace
Shines no light upon my face
Through the darkness, we still speed
My white bicycle and me

My white bicycle, my white bicycle
",My White Bicycle,1994
Steve Howe,"I'll be the round about
The words will make you out 'n' out
You change the day  your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and
In and out the valley

[Chorus]

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see 
I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and
Even in the valley

[Chorus]

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
Down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
The rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather
Spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more
Than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers
By in our hand
Nex to your deeper fears we stand
Surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

[Chorus]

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way

Steve Howe,"Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
I know it drives you crazy
When I pretend you don't exist
When I'd like to lean in close
And run my hands against your lips
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number

Don't worry I'm not looking at you

Then come in close and hear you laugh

Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number

Steve Howe,"Realizing a form out of stone
Set hands moving
Roan shaped his heart
Through his working hands

Work to mold his passion into clay
Like the sun
In his room, his lady
She would dance and sing so completely

So be still, he now cries
I have time, oh let clay transform thee so, love
In the deep cold of night
Winter calls, he cries, don't deny me

For his lady, deep her illness
Time has caught her
And will for all reasons take her
In the still light of dawn, she dies

Helpless hands soul revealing
Like leaves we touch, we learn
We once knew the story
As winter calls he will starve

All but to see the stone be life
Now Roan no more tears
Set to work his strength
So transformed him

Realizing a form out of stone, his work
So absorbed him
Could she hear him
Could she see him

All aglow was his room bathed in this light
He would touch her
He would hold her
Laughing as they danced

Highest colors touching others
Did her eyes at the turn of the century
Tell me plainly
How we meet, how we'll love

Or let life, so transform me
Like leaves we touched, we danced
We once knew the story
As autumn called and we both

Remembered all those many years ago
I'm sure we know
Was the sign with a touch
As I kiss your fingers

We walk hands in the sun
Memories when we're young
Love lingers so
Was it sun through the haze

That made all your looks
Warm as moonlight
As a pearl, deep your eyes
Tears have flown away

All the same light
Did her eyes at the turn of the century
Tell me plainly
When we meet how we'll look

As we smile time will leave me clearly
Like leaves we touch, we search
We will know the story
As autumn calls we will both remember

All those many years ago",Turn of the Century,1995
Steve Howe,"11:59 and it's all going well, the next second could be our last 
This is the moment we've all waited for, to see if the world's gonna' pass 
The seer and the psychic, the prophets of doom, are saying the world is at end 
It's all coming down to the next breath of life, the fear mongers fate is at hand 
Something we've never faced before 
Nothing we've ever seen before 
Will we all make it through the door 
That leads to the next century? 
Y2K was a heartbeat away, still everyone sounds the alarm 
Where did you hide when the digits all turned, did computers and power go down? 
The party's alive in California, in Times Square the clock's ticking on 
All over the world, spinning out of control, Celebration 2000 lives on 
Something we've never faced before 
Nothing we've ever seen before 
But we all made it through the door 
That leads to the next century 
Fear of the unknown causes doubt 
Millennium madness runs about 
The turn of the century rolls on 
The end of the world has come and gone 
Believe what you will but life goes on 
The turn of the century lives on 

Fear of the unknown causes doubt 
Millennium madness runs about 
The turn of the century rolls on 
The end of the world has come and gone 
Believe what you will but life goes on 
The turn of the century lives on

Drifting endlessly by the bridge
To be over

Time will heal your fear
Think it over
Balance the thoughts that release within you

One to seek and see in ev'ry light do open
True pathways away

After all don't doubt your part

Steve Howe,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky

But the pain lingers on

Close To The Edge

I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe

In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.

I get up, I get down,
I get up, I get down.
Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?

[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]

I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.


And You And I

I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Coins and crosses

Turn round tailor, assaulting

Never know their fruitless worth;

all the mornings of the interest shown,

presenting one another to the cord,

Cords are broken,

All left dying, rediscovered

Of the door that turned round,

Locked inside the mother earth.

To close the cover, all the

interest shown,

They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,

To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb.

Watching the world, watching all of the world,

Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.
And you and I reach over the sun for the river.
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.


Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dude'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over my head

Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

Is there a vision here
Woven to touch
And all to capture light?
Surely the stream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I'm really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days

There I knelt at the foot of an open sky
Is it by faith, not time
The sun does climb
To light the path for us?
And I can embrace where I'm going
Tomorrow has already found me

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
I lost my touch to handle with kid gloves
In the rough game of push and shove
I lost sight
I used to believe in your love
To be believed in
Once more tonight

Will you speak to me fathers?
Grant me the words
That one day I'll be called to speak
And finally I am here understanding
The clear and constant page
Despite the shroud of material ways
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If you lose your touch to handle with kid gloves
In the hard game of push and shove
Don't lose sight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight

Surely this dream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I'm really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If it all comes down to push and shove
Remember to lift your heart above the fight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in

To turn wrong to right
Beyond all the pain and the strife
Ride the turning tide
Lift a strength deep inside
We can transform wrong to right

We can still receive the love
To be believed in

Hide from the dark here in the arms of love.
Run from the fear inside the darkest reaches.
Look to yourself; you'll see the light of fear.

Steve Howell,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Steve Hunter,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I try so hard, I can't rise above it

Steve Ivey,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man.

And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can;

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance

I'll keep you satisfied

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

Steve Jones,"Once upon a time there were three little pigs
Who went out into the big world
To build their homes and seek their fortunes.

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my axe in my holster
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy boaster
The sherrif at the border, he tried to take me out
I drew my axe with the quickness-and cut his adam's apple out!
Walked in the village and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door and shot me in the face
And blew me off the porch-and blew my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo so it only made me laugh (ha ha!)
Axe in hand, I rose like the dead
And swung with all my might- made a thump noise in his head
Since we out west, I grabbed a shotgun
And blew his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium!!

[Chorus:]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like a sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)
The carnival's in town- come and get your piggy snacks

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a mother fuckin dick
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a Volkswagen Bug seventeen deep
Packed fulla Juggalos, lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out- we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in pursuit like Starsky and Hutch
But there's only two of them-the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkin Donuts to gather up the rest

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

And every night 'neath the full crimson moon above,
This brave young soldier, would pledge her his love.

To wear in her hair, till he's with her once more.
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana,
Mounted his pony, and rode off to war.

Seems that Apaches were causing unrest again.
He kissed Rosana goodbye as he rode away,
Promising this time he'd come back to stay.

That the Apaches had burned the whole village down.
And 'neath the tree where he'd last kissed Rosana,
Gripped on the cross, was his yellow bandana.

Looks like rain's on the way 
Looks like whatever you say 
Yes I'm afraid to ask 

What's right for you is not right for me 
Now I see what you want me to be 
Sunrise in the wrong constellation 
Star sign pointing to my destination 
Take my place in a long line of confusion 
Just a taste of my own brand of illusion 
Brand of illusion 

Like battle lines are drawn 
Everything I say is wrong 
And the silence cries out to us 
Should we leave well enough alone 
Or take what we call our own 
Is it love we do not trust 

What's right for you is not right for me 
Now I see what you want me to be 
What's right for you",Right for You,1997
Steve Kaye,"Like a river to the sea 
You will come back to me 
Into the waiting night 
You will be the light 

Like the rain that fills the ground 
You are falling down 
And to this empty earth 
You will be returned 

Like a ship that sails alone 
You are far from home 
And through a raging storm 
You will be reborn 

Until your journey's through 
I will wait for you 
And when this circle ends 
I will have you again 

Like a river to the sea 
You will come back to me 
You will come back to me",River to the Sea,1997

Frozen I held my breath
Right from the start
I knew that I'd found a home for my heart
Beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away

One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you

For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

She looks right through


Like a ghost (take a look before I melt away)
Like a ghost (take a look before I melt away)


Twelve o'clock when the wine runs out
Go out on the balcony, hear someone shout
I look below
Is that my body on the street
Check the mirror, nobody home
I can't find a razor, can't find a comb
We've got to have a talk
'cause you're dressed in a sheet


Well I really start to worry when I stand in the queue
It's starting to pour and I don't know what to do
Funny thing is
That I don't get wet
I hail a cab but he sails out of sight
What's my name, what's my age, what am I doing in this night
These questions and answers
I try but I forget

Cover my footprints with ice
The cool gray sea calls me ""come and be free""
And I almost take that advice
And in the night I cling to the names
Of the women I wanted and the men that I blamed
And their scorn that scorches my tracks
One thing I know you can never come back
Oh darling please meet me in the dark empty streets
Won't you bring me the things that I need
No-one is waiting where she used to stand
Just the jagged thorns of the weed
And in the day they drink their hot wine
And I long for the things that can never be mine
So your pretty clothes do not unpack
As plain as the day you can never come back

I've been listening to myself too long
And they're making a prophet out of me

No it must have been the library
Reading a book which once gave me hope
Now it's making a fool out of me
I'm as empty as a shell can ever be
Lazy dreaming, half remembering, half remarking to myself
Never noticed that the crowds were leaving
Never looked for anyone else
Now it's market day almost every day
Yet they give away their love for free

From the top of samir
Or even hermon
From the lairs of lions
From the mouths of leopards

You have made my heart beat
By one of your eyes
By just one pendant of your necklace
Open to me, oh my sister, my girl companion
For my head is filled with the dew
The locks of my hair with the drops of the night
I've put off my robe, how can I put it back on
I've washed my feet, how can I soil them

Liquid, she's drinking more of everything

She drained an ocean out of me
Left me washed up in bankruptcy
Like a storm far out to sea, she's gone

She ran like water through my hands
Silver drops on thirsty lands
Then she sank into the sand, she's gone

Stranded on a saw-toothed reef
She bled my life beyond belief
Just another fluid thief, she's gone

Sometimes I think of the lives I could have led
Before the sweet nectar, heat and lust came shimmering out of my head
In a salty cave I perspire pure oblivion
A sexual dimension, of black and vermilion
She said I'm drowning, in the voice of an alien
There was no life for me
Sometimes I plan the revenge I will sustain
The rapture of the deep, rivers and rain
We swam through the channels of an underground cleft
I couldn't keep going, I was losing my breath
Woozy with fever, catching my death
There was no cure for me
Sometimes I remember the blue island skies
Well I was seeing the world through enchanted eyes
Coral cut my fingers, my blood tasted good
She dived in and drank more than she should
Left me drifting like driftwood
There was no hope for me
Sometimes I hear the birds, the crash of the waves
Across the black lake where the fisherman slaves
Electric eels, in translucent coils
The lava erupts and the green ocean boils
Taking her bait, burning my oils
There was no stopping me",Liquid,1990

Cut off an infidel's finger
Just to steal the wedding ring
And give it to the singer.

In the bloody chamber
About the mad tiger

With the symbols and incense
To both krishna and buddha
And the goddess of fortune
For an indian lover
To wake kundalini
Your beautiful yonni
But also iscariot
Who comes to betray us
With just one english kiss.

Deep in the autumn
I lie in my bedroom
Just one more long shadow
Fall into the corners
I reach for a woman
Who harbors in darkness
She lands on a mountain
Sways for a moment
Crashes in pieces all over my eyes.
All over my eyes

And when you get tired
Of fake little evenings
Slip through your fingers
And don't keep their promise.
Such a sad vision
It breaks up my daydream
Such a sad vision, breaks up my daydream

Look up that sleeve, where is the rabbit
Already secreted along with the dove
Where is the passion, already depleted
Just like the love.

Can you imagine what I can manage
With your permission, with your consent.
I know what you're thinking
Hear what you're saying, how could I ever?
I know what you like.
I think I know what you like.
I'm sure I know what you like.

I met miss linda wong, she was looking for me
She led me to her bedroom
Wonderful things she said
Too much for my head, like I'm all at sea

Her bones shone through her skin
Her eyes were green and tin (? ),
She floated in the wind,
The wind from the sea
Her arms were thin and scarred,
Her face was young and hard
But her mind was a garden, open for me
If I stay here too much longer
Much have needed something stronger
I never would belong her
World was not mine
Together we've float and drift
On what we smoked and sniffed
Press a button on the lift, for cloud 9

Her bones shone through her skin
Her eyes were green and tin (? )

The wind from the sea
Her pale chinese cheeks
Ain't seen the sun for weeks,
That ain't the life she seeks

Into the lake
Wades through the weeds, comes to the party
What a mistake

And now, now he's waiting for a miracle
But how, when it's midnite in america

Stupid magician, with your cloak and your wand,
Pulls out a rabbit, he's got a bad habit
He's quite overfond.
The woman took the man, and man did she drop him
Onto the floor
Crawls to the exit, he sings like a swallow
Knocks at her door

And now, now he's waiting for a miracle
How, when it's midnite in america

Mixed up and empty, probably dead
The company paid it, the aliens laid it
Down on his head
The boyfriend hit a kid, I kid you not
He hurt him real bad
He lay in the garden, he bled in the flowers
Its awfully sad

But now, now he's waiting for a miracle,

I take the things from their leather cases
And I arrange them in their special places
I collected people like you might collect flowers
But they only lived for a couple of hours
A famous flicker in these flames
And hear the waiting and played their games

Only a mad dog would turn on the world
Only a mad dog would turn on the world

I watched the morning in the evening
I saw the clouds as they were leaving
Collected people as you might collect stamps
Princes, killers, heroes, tramps

With scant regard and no perfume

Only a mad dog would turn on the world
Only a mad dog would turn on the world (left for you)

I have performed to find the ???
In avenues and garden groves
I collected people like you might collect coins
I quenched their hearts and burned their loins

Near the place (3:33) their soldiers wept

And all my time has run out
Just seconds in a jar
All the nights that I owned
In Saxony and Cuba

Steve Kimock,"Check out the scheme of a dream thick fog all around me 
Standing in a tunnel of blood hounds surround me 
Shadow of a child my eyes visualize and figure 
And as you walked backwards the shadow grew bigger 
Temptation made me curios to follow it 
All fear in my heart at that point I done swallowed it 
State like trance as I reach out my hand 
You wore an overcoat robe face was disclosed 
Now was this a dream or reality 
I was about to become one of Satan's fuckin fatalities 
In silence, I hear the wings of a black crow flappin 
The bird lands, then appears a man 
Very sleek in physique, stood about six feet 
Dispute was jet black I had to step back 
His dimeanor wasn't pure, I knew this for sure 
He had a diseased look that the world couldn't cure 
I'm forzen, the fear returned to my body 
Heart pumpin so fast, I thought I was goin into cardiac arrest 
I wake up in a cold sweat, wifey sleepin on my left sound asleep 
I peep around the room then I make a sudden jest 
A feather from a black crow was beside my pillow 
Was it a sign from God to repute for the things that I did in my lifetime 
Now my soul's on the line 
I'm puzzled, spark up a Newport 
Then I take a fall in hell it's the cancer 
Then I try and find an answer 

My wisdom that I'm droppin is- 
Is somethin like a doctor and 
Necessary like oxygen 
I'm seein who's my opposite 
And who's my aid in life 
So let's attract and repell 
Third rate government they tryin to seize the world 
Day like a rose, the wind is blowin hard against the window 
Pull up the blinds there sits the crow 
I back up fast heart beatin massive 
Lost my breath, collapsin fallin on the mattress 
I went into a state of unconsciousness 
Open my eyes up, I'm layin on the dark street 
Leaves blowin in the breezes, Jesus 
I on the street like a nightmare 
I take flight, a bird through the air 
While I'm wingin it I see all sorts of chaos 
Dead bodies, burned buildings turned over cars 
Uh-uh, seein visions of an all out war 
Territory factors, picture escape from New York 
Gun fire, blomb flowin, nerve gas a-flowin 
Just imagine whole race of Harlem gaurds showin 
Realizin I was havin out-of-body experience 
Return to my physical and wake up tense 
Layin in the hospital as I figured the riddle 
G-O-D was throwin at me paranormally so 
Givin sight beyond sight about the world we know 
A preminition that I saw through the eyes of a pro",The Crow,1995
Steve Kindler,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Steve Kuhn,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1998
Steve Kuhn,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,1999

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Steve LaManna,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,
Steve LaSpina,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1988
Steve LaSpina,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Steve LaSpina,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

She's lost in the crowd

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

To make my fantasy

You're the flame of love to me

Out Of My Dreams

You always slip in when I'm asleep
I thought those old feelings would be long gone by now
Why in the world do you bother to come back around
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life
Out of every thought
That I let cross my mind
You're out of my hopes
That it might be you every time the telephone rings
But will I ever get you out of my dreams
There we were making wishes on evening stars
Promises sealed with kisses straight from our hearts
But then I woke up to reality again
Even the sweetest dreams come to an end
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station

Steve Lawrence,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You [From Babes on Broadway],1964
Steve Lawrence,"Dreary days are over
Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago (And Far Away) [From Cover Girl],1964
Steve Lawrence,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart! 

[Chorus]",My Foolish Heart [From My Foolish Heart],1964
Steve Lawrence,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap [*],1964
Steve Lawrence,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Happy holidays to you

If your nerves are wearing thin
Pack your load
Down the road
And come to Holiday Inn
If the traffic noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares
Down the stairs
And come to Holiday Inn
If you can't find someone who 
Will set your heart a whirl
Take your car and motor to 
The home of boy meets girl
If you're laid-up with a breakdown
Throw away your vitamin
Don't get worse
Grab your nurse
And come to Holiday Inn

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

At the fireplace while we watch
the chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop!

There's a happy feeling

And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

You've got me in your spell.
Bewitched, Bewitched,
You know your craft so well.
Before I knew what I was doing
I looked in your eyes
That brand of woo you've been brewin'
Took me by surprise.

You witch, you witch,
One thing is for sure.
That stuff you pitch
Just hasn't got a cure.

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Steve Lawrence,"I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

That all I longed for long ago was you

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart!

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer

I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.

Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

In the night
It snowed
Fast tracks in the powder white
Leading out to the road
Winding from her tender grasp

I can't wait 'til the night comes fallin' down
I gotta see you again
And ever if it couldn't be forever

My heart is burning with the heat of this
Emotional fire
Every time I see you
I'm on fire, every time we touch
Can't you feel me burnin' with desire
Baby feel warm, give me some
Emotional fire
Emotional fire

There's a feelin' when I'm here beside you
Couldn't leave you and I wouldn't try to
Baby, I'd only need you again
There ain't nothin' that can break this fever
The love gets stronger and the passion deeper
Hold on, hold on

I can't let go 'cause there's no stoppin' this

Every time I see you
I'm on fire, every time we touch
Can't you feel me burnin' with desire

So who made me part of destiny
Who made me part of their game
Can't you feel it hurt
Too much pain to endure

But there's nobody home

Isolation far from home

This childhood dream
Must be real
I can feel it
Now I understand
This comfort of man
Take my hand
Fall into velvet

You can touch where you've never been touched
See further than you've ever seen
Fall into velvet

I was touched by those who know
Of this power to fly alone
As the path will twist and wind
Leave for others, as we find
So the future may collect

Can't you hear the thunder
And it looks like rain

Every man for himself

I hear, hear it sounding
Through these paper-thin walls
I can hear people lying under oath
Lovers breaking their vows
I don't want to give up hope
Is it too late now

Hadn't seen before
That's what brought me hope
Knockin' on your back door

A closet queen, the worst I've seen
She wants to shake my hand
I don't want to be there
When she decides she can
It's apple dan, he's just the man
To pick fruit off your branches
I can't sleep if he can't keep
His cattle off my ranches

It's too strong, something's wrong
And I guess I lost the feeling
I don't mind the games you play
But I don't like you dealing

And there's nothin' left to smoke
Will all be back tomorrow
For the punch line of the joke",The Bomber,1994

Hand covers up your sleepless eyes
As morning creeps in 
Passed out there on my couch
Wearing the face of down and out
My long lost friend
Three cups of coffee and you'll be on your way
Until this time tomorrow you come crawling
Back again
Open your heart to me
Think of my shoulder as as sanctuary
Open your soul to me
I'll try to unravel your tangled up dreams
And the only thing that matters is your heart stays open for me
I always made pictured you
As clear minded but confused with wounds
No one could see
You always made the friends
That never stuck with you until the end
Except for me
And the only difference I hear is your alibi
And the only thing in common is the reason
You're still here
Open your heart to me
Think of my shoulder as sanctuary

And the only thing that matters is your heart stays open for me

Mama died and my daddy got drunk

With the help of the treesome god

Steve Lukather,"Remember when you were young
You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond

You were caught on the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend
You martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond

Well you wore out 
Your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper
You prisoner, and shine","Shine On You, Crazy Diamond",2014

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

As I found your foolish note
While I understand your pain
I could see what you've to gain
By leaving me alone

But your love whispers through my life
And I can't fake the pain inside

And my tears have all dried up
Because the distance we shared
Was an enemy of love

And my coat in my hand
I'm gonna take this distance
Unto another man's land

Daddy played the banjo, ?neath the yellow tree,

It rang across the backyard, an old time melody,

I loved to hear the music, I was only five,

I listened as his fingers made the banjo come alive.


Sometimes I?d wake up at night, and hear a distant tune,

The banjo would echo, ?round my childhood room,

I?d sneak down the back stairs, Daddy never knew.

I?d grab a broom and make believe, I was pickin?, too.

--Chorus--

One day Daddy put my fingers down upon his fist,

He picked it with his other hand, we made the banjo ring;


Now the music takes me back, cross the yellow day, 

Soon the summer?s with my Dad, and the tunes he made.

--Break--

But I?m just tellin? lyes ?bout the things I did,

See I?m that banjo player who never had a kid,

Now, I sit, beneath that yellow tree,

Hopin? that a kid somewhere, is listening to me.


Daddy played the banjo, ?neath the yellow tree,

It rang across the backyard and wove a spell on me,

Now the banjo takes me back, through the foggy haze,

With memories of what never was, become the good old days.

And my gangster ways
They would have hung up their guns

When i go into a bar
Girls from near and far
Say i'm a gangster
A gangster of love

I jumped in my white horse cadillac
I rode across the border line
I roped 55 girls
I kissed them all the same time
Took 25 or 30, put 'em all on a freight
There was a million dollar reward for me in each and every state

Steve Miller,"Inside her silver house, alone 
She sings a song 
Of water turned to sand 
She waits, her time is her own 

Inside her looking glass 
Black is the color she sees 
While waiting for the sun 
She lives, so patiently 

Young man travelling along 
Passes by a window 
Singing a song 

Feel the wind blow 
As my blood flows 
Through the shadows 
Of my soul, today 

See the rainbows 
As my love grows 
My heart knows 
What my mind won't say 

The living is easy 
I'm born to be free 
The living is easy 
There's no reason to explain 

Sitting in her sitting room, patiently 
She waits for a change, suddenly 
Oh, the changes come 
Hearing a song, her blood begins to flow 
She no longer is alone 

Lying in her sitting room, silently 
He touches her hand, joyfully 
And so love has begun 
With joy in her heart 
She receives his flowing soul 
And love grows 
And it grows 
And it grows 

Inside her purple house 
Oh Lord, filled by her man 
A child begins to grow 
Oh Lord, who can understand

What a sacrifice 
 
Lookin' back on time that's gone 
I realized I might have been wrong 
But Macon took you for a ride 
They broke us up for their own pride

You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
Then waited all night by your door

But lately you live in the jungle
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem
The question to everyone's answer
Is usually asked from within
But the patterns of the rain and the truth they contain
Have written my life on your skin

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

You swim in my blood when it's warm
My cycles of circular motion
Protect you and keep you from harm
You live in a world of illusion
Where everything's peaches and cream
We all face a scarlet conclusion
But we spend our time in a dream

That make a fool of you 
  
She make a young man old 
And an old man pay 
The way she took my money 
Was a crying shame 
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar 
  
Put a detective 
On her trail 
The post office thought 
They'd chase her by the mail 
  
She got picked up 
And then was put in jail 
Stroked the judge 
Just to go her bail 
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar 
  
She left Detroit 
To go to Kalamazoo 
Made her a fortune 
Out of fools like you 
  
Met her a rich man 
Who was married and had some kids 
Stroked that cat 
Until he flipped his lid 
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my watch and chain 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou 
She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car

She came back into town 
About a week ago 
Told me she's sorry 
She had hurt me so 
  
I had a '65 Ford 
And a two dollar bill 
The way she took that 
Lord, it gave me a thrill

I heard him shout 
As he cut out 
Well you ain't lost nothin' 
What you cryin' about
