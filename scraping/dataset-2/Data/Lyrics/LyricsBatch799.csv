Olivier Dion,"Je sais ce que je laisse 
C’est à contre cœur 
Mais un ailleurs m’appelle envers et contre tout 
Je sais ceux que je blesse, je vois leur douleur 
Mais j’en ferais une force qui me suivra partout 

Comme un pont-levis qui s’ouvre à la vie 
On ne va loin que jusqu'au bout 
Bien plus qu’un pari, et même un défi 
Si je reviens ce sera debout 

Mais il faut s'en aller quand il le faut 
Croire en son étoile pour toucher le ciel 
Et moi je veux voler, voler plus haut 
De mes propres ailes, voler 
De mes propres ailes 

De mes propres ailes, voler 
De mes propres ailes 

Je sais que la jeunesse est faite d’erreurs 
Qu’on en paye un jour les revers et contrecoups 
Mais à quoi sert qu’on naisse, à quoi sert qu’on meurt 
Sans avoir vécu ses rêves, même les plus fous 

Quand un pont-levis vous ouvre à l’envie 
On ne va loin que jusqu’au bout 
Qu’importe ce qu’on dit 

Et de tous les avis 
Je ne crains rien, plus rien du tout 

Mais il faut s’en aller quand il le faut 
Croire en son étoile pour toucher le ciel 
Et moi je veux voler, voler plus haut 
De mes propres ailes, voler 
De mes propres ailes 

De mes propres ailes, voler 
De mes propres ailes 

Sans vous oublier (eh) 
Sans ne jamais rien regretter 
Partir pour tout commencer 
Oh oh 
Sans vous oublier (eh) 
Sans ne jamais me retourner 
Partir là où tout peut arriver 

Mais il faut s’en aller quand il le faut 
Croire en son étoile pour toucher le ciel 
Et moi je veux voler, voler plus haut 
De mes propres ailes, voler 
De mes propres ailes 

De mes propres ailes 
Pour toucher le ciel",De mes propres ailes [Skydancers Remix],2016
Olivier Manoury,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round About Midnight,2005
OlivierDaySoul,"I feel like I'm pinned on the mat
In the middle of spaghetti road
I know there's a light at the end
But the tunnel it seems so narrow

Trying to find my way but my shoes is feeling heavy
They say I'm always dragging my feet
Now the world is measured on how fast you can get it
So I'm left behind before I can reach
Before I can reach, yeah

Makin' a life for yourself
It's getting harder everyday, who are you!
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar,
Said he's trying to find a way, who are you!
Life isn't as long as you think
Spend it wise while you're awake, who are you!
Timing is father to you
And it will never be the same, who are you!

(La la la la la la) Who are you

Surrounded, oh he's taking part in the habitation of your soul
But just cause you like the way it looks don't mean it's gonna suit ya
Don't mean it's gonna suit ya
Now is not composure and I'm not in a hurry
Could you say that in a frugiless time
Before you even blink
The day is to the night
And the ball would drop the 13th time
Still you're wondering why?
Yeah, yeah

I'm making a move
While time over bares the rules
Don't pen can be stackin', this tale
I'ma never is tell what you sing is close to gamble
Compose the faith and all the things I've seen
Change the favor of successful things
Gotta be more than a dream, I know!
Sometimes I could be slow and then the rest of the pack
But rest assured, no matter how much I fall I never refrain
Get back on the bike
Peddlin' hard I generate life
Wanna be soft, flavor the world
Be an example to all the boys and girls 'cause

Makin' a life for yourself
Is getting harder everyday, who are you!
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar,
Said he's trying to find a way, who are you!
Life isn't as long as you think

Olivver the Kid,"In the city, I'm always awake
There's a symphony of music in the street
And I get high to drown it out
But it don't work, it just gets louder
In the city, in the city

The big apple took a bite out of me
Look what I turned out to be
I wonder if my mama really means it when she says that she's proud of me
Or is she tripping, is she lying
Is she on to all my lies? Mean that shit ain't rocket science
I've been coming home at four, and my eyes been red as sirens
I miss slurring all my words when she asked me how my night went
I swear it's them white boys, it's them white boys
Everything they do is so much doper than my life been
I don't got that type of money, I don't got that finance
She's like, why you so lazy trying to get by
Back before I smoked, I wasn't even tryna get high
Cigarette breaks at lunch time
Bong rips to my face, I passed out at Dave's place
In the morning tryna get right
Nigga's got a curfew, you ain't ready for these bright lights

In the city, I'm always awake
There's a symphony of music in the street
And I get high to drown it out
But it don't work, it just gets louder
In the city, in the city

You really changed, change is good
When you said don't let the city change you, I think it should
Come from different angles, see it different ways
I don't got the money, maybe we can make a trade
If I can make you laugh, you can spot me cash
What's the move on Tues? 
Yo I heard it's ave
These girls are kinda bougie, mom calls 'em fast
Some say you pretentious but I call it class
Prep school boys with their collars popped
Coming through the spot, always see you with your sleeves rolled up
Even with a uniform
I could never do the norm
How could I forget? I be on some shit
Now I rock sweats and I still get it
New kids never fit in, I wasn't any different
Had to get my mind right, wasn't ready for those bright lights

In the city, I'm always awake
There's a symphony of music in the street
And I get high to drown it out
But it don't work, it just gets louder
In the city, in the city

Let's do something dangerous
Break the rules, yeah let's shake it up
Let's do something dangerous
In the city that was made for us

Olivver the Kid,"I got short comings, we got more coming
What was in that shot 'cause I need more of it
Hit the ground runnin', drop it down for me
Couple thou on it, I might while on it
Young nigga act a fool but he talented
And the love and the work it’s hard to balance them
All the time that I lost tryna salvage it
Man these niggas lost they swag that’s some tragic shit
I’m a prince come smoke in one of my palaces
Go together like Pusha T and Malice did
Nah I don’t love her
I was with the homies 'cause the homies will comfort
You know how it is
Dabbin' too much call me Wax Payne
Her dad famous yo I only know her last name
And all these niggas on the bandwagon mad fake
You get the message, I learned my lesson

Disrespected, so neglectful
Kid from the uptown where we disrespectful
I smoke weed all the time get forgetful
Stay with me for the night I’ll be gentle
And I tend to smash girls who don’t give a fuck
And drink twenty dollar vodka and red bulls
And she gotta a lot of baggage she ain’t get to
And she say she got some problems she gon’ get through
Well I’m like we all got our issues
Stay up all night smoke weed watch visuals
Thinking too much make it big when it’s little
I’m the realest nigga out girl it’s simple
You got questions, I got the answers
Drunk at the club spillin' whiskey on the dancers
I need a purpose, she need a surface
Catch a car to the crib girl it’s urgent

Like this, like this, like this like this like this
Oh
I wish, but I never thought I’d get it like this
No
Like this, like this like this like, this
I wish, but I never thought I’d do it like this

This is my shit
I need a girl to fly with
I know your man don’t do you like this

Olivver the Kid,"Don't think if you thinkin' wrong
This the type of song you could sing along
This the type of song you relate to
She wouldn't talk much
Hit the bong, had a breakthrough
Ooh one and the joint we should be alone
Don't say nothin' foul, you on speakerphone
It's just the homies and I told em that you comin' thru
Leave the club at 1 or 2, probably leave at 1 or 2
Keep it casual, bitches mad at you
Keep it pushin' girl, and move it lateral
I know you been weird
So baby why you actin' cool?
Why you actin' coy, girl I ain't a fool
Let's get it, but only if you wit it
And I hate commitment
And man I need forgiveness
And she gon' say I did some shit
I probably really didn't
It's too late, but now I really did it

Let's get down to the bottom of this
Tonight, while you are gone
Tomorrow things will look different, I know
If I make it back home

Yeah, tryna make it to the promised land
Feelin' on shorty's butt, drink is in the other hand
Aggressive when I drink too much
Hopin' that she understand
But I know she understand
Shorty I'm the fuckin' man
And I say that cause I always do deliver
Well maybe I should chill and reconsider
These niggas can't compete, they resumes is weak
Drivin' somewhere cool, the city with dumb heat
Shorty wanna dance, I'm a little bit clumsy
You got your boobs enhanced, they look at little bit bigger
And I know you got these niggas all over you
But she got a [?] and I'm a little bit iller
Put the bottle in the freezer, a little bit chiller
We need something to mix the weed with
Stay up 'til 7 and watch the sunrise, all night with the weed lit
Cookin' breakfast in my flannel, isn't the view scenic?

Let's get down to the bottom of this
Tonight, while you are gone
Tomorrow things will look different, I know
If I make it back home

I'm thinkin' of myself
No room for anyone else
Forgotten of my head
My girlfriend and my house

Tonight, while you are gone
Tomorrow things will look different, I know

Olivver the Kid,"Wasting all of this time
I don't mind (Mind, yeah no no)
Wasting all this of time
I don't, I said I don't mind

Tell me who the most consistent
Is when I leave she be so persistent
Crib overseas cause my bitch is foreign
Please light the weed get to problem solving
Never mind school we got lots of knowledge
She got some big dreams but she stuck in college
Look me in the eye since you speak
Like you got this shit all figured out (all figured out)
Keenan got the Audi and we all liquored out
Took one dab now she all trippin' out
SportsCenter anchor this a whole different route
She mad I live at home, like you ever moving out
Bitch, patience is the key
I know I gotta lay up but I'm taking it from three
I'm pacing victory
Just wait and see, time is of the essence
Wasting never wasted, I'm taking this for me

Wasting all of this time
I don't mind (Mind, yeah no no)
Wasting all this of time
I don't, I said I don't mind

Tell me who the most consistent
Is tell her chill, be home in an instant
I took her out for dinner, called the Uber, see it yet?
Look at me and laugh, she say ""you ain't copped the Beamer yet?""
Selling records now, ain't you supposed to flex more?
Playing in like 16 countries on my next tour
She said ""I get it but at least could send a text more
If you got time for the music, what's the rest for?""
Everything in due time, patience is a virtue
Thinking about what other people got should never hurt you
If you're too weak your heart gets broken like a curfew
Anything worth having always takes some time to pursue
Nothing comes fast except a virgin
Can never take a shortcut, I'm not that type of person
If you love what you have, well then what's the point of searching?
I ever hear you cheatin' it's a wrap like a turban
Quick visits here and there, hope it helps still
I know she longs for commitment and something else real
I'm never around, she look like she on the shelf still
Told me ""you don't cop a ring soon, someone else will""

Wasting all of this time
I don't mind (Mind, yeah no no)
Wasting all this of time
I don't, I said I don't mind

Tell me who the most consistent
B gotta leave cause I need my distance
Still feeling different, missing Pops on Christmas
Still spit the truth and the youth will listen
Niggas after cheese, niggas on a mission
Make 'em cooler now, I'm the new edition
5'5"" LA girl, cute with dimples
It's not complicated, yo, it's super simple
Now Skizzy be the man wanna see you doing good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl in my eyes you the dopest
Reason why I love you 'cause you always keep focused
And I'm always stressing but you know I keep hoping
Had the door closed now you always keep open
Keep smoking, keep motion
It's called progress, take breaks but not yet
Don't take it out of context

Olle Adolphson,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa, God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2000

Sie inspiriert mich, jeder Blick, jede Geste, 
Jede Nuance ihrer Mimik elektrisiert mich. 
Ich glaub ihr jederzeit, Probleme löst sie spielerisch, 
Sie trifft mit jedem Pfeil, alles wirkt so federleicht. 
Sie stellt die Sonne ein, haucht den Wind und hängt die Sterne, 
Tief in meinen Horizont, ihr Lächeln schenkt mir Licht und Wärme. 
Sie gibt der Richtung Halt, sie hält mich auf den Wegen, 
Sie ist die Lichtung im Wald, sie ist das Zelt im Regen. 
Ich kann mich ihr nicht entziehen, kann mich nicht los sagen, 
Ich sing ihr Liebeslieder wie Wölfe den Mondphasen. 
Ich zieh' für sie an jede Front, in jede Schlacht, ein Leben lang, 
Weil ich ohne diesen Sieg nicht leben kann. 
Selbst wenn sie nicht hier ist, sie begleitet mich, 
Ich leg mein Ohr auf die Schiene, wenn sie auf Reisen ist. 
Ihre Schwingung ist harmonisch, sie trifft jeden Ton, 
Ihre Berührung ist musisch, ihr Kuss Inspiration.",Meine Muse,2009

Die erbeutete Summe beläuft sich auf über 450.000 Euro!

Und guck wo's Leben für mich die Locken versteckt!
Manchmal denk ich mir schnapp' dir die Pumpgun erschieß' dich doch gleich!
Mein mieses Life is 'ne Bitch im Grund risikoreich!
Ich erschieße den Feind höchstens auf der X-Box daheim!
Schließe mich ein um wieder weinend an der Krise zu feilen!

Ich dagegen guck 'n Wholecar, verstehste?
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Kann ich atmen, ohne Rap, ich stell's mir hart vor
Ich schreib' es hin, wenn ich mir Luft mache, wie ein Ventilator
Es reinigt mich von innen und es dient als Sprachrohr
Meine Träume, meine Artform, verstehst du?
Immer, wenn ich rhyme hab ich etwas, woran ich mich festhalte
Ich vergesse die Welt wie 'ne gelöschte Festplatte
Ich schlage Schneisen in die Lichtung für die Morgensonne
Mit den Mic, immer wenn die Sorgen kommen

Der Stift wird mein Meißel sein
Und Stein für Stein fällt von meinem Herzen

Ich blick' nach oben und hoff', morgen wird ein besserer Tag

Gefühle brechen aus, ich finde einen Beat
Der mein Gefühl versteht und sprech' mich aus
In Hypnose text' ich auf'n Blatt Papier, nächtlich auf-
Wacht am 4, mächtig laut, das ist, wie ich ticke, Bruder
(Immer, wenn ich rhyme)
Und wenn ich spitte, blute ich meine Wunde aus, will aus dem
Dunkeln raus und das Schreiben hilft mir unermesslich
Ich will runter, Stress ist für meinen Geist nur Gift

Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Glänzen ihre Augen, schlägt ihr Herz schneller
Ihr bekommt den besten Flow ever direkt vom Hersteller

Ist das zu fassen?
Jede Zeile bricht die Schweigepflicht
Straight aus dem Bauch entweder schrei ich oder schrei ich nicht
Könntest du mir freiwillig den Wagen geben
Sonst muss ich dich schlagen, treten, das ist mir
Schon immer scheißegal gewesen
Überfahr dich, park deine Scheißkarre in Holland
Könnte einfach so am Zollamt vorbeifahren auf'm Roller
Bring das Weed nach hause, erzähl nix von Weedverkaufen du Fisch
Du kannst viel behaupten, doch du existierst überhaupt nicht für mich

Ist das zu fassen?
Ich will wirklich nicht cholerisch sein
Doch wenn ich spitte wirkt sogar Kinski gegen mich pflegeleicht

Mach wirbel in Amerika
Asien, Europa, den Mond erober ich nächstes Jahr
Wenn du zu frech wirst vergrab ich dich im Rasen, Ficker
Ja ich bin ein psychopatischer Killer, ein Wahnsinniger
Dein Label dehnt deinen Anus, du kommst dir wie 'n großer Star vor
Du hast jetzt Top10 Hits aber dafür hast du so ein Arschloch
Du bist fake, phony und du lügst in deinem Text
Image kann Realität nicht ersetzen wie Cybersex
Dein Produzent bitet Timbaland seinen Sohn
Ganz ehrlich, so ein Arschloch ist verantwortlich für deine Produktion?
Nich dein Ernst, ihr seid sehr behaarte Hinterwäldler
Und im falschen Beruf wie ein pädophiler Kindergärtner
Du machst auf Zuhälter und sagst du hättest 50 Huren
Suchst aber gleichzeitig deinen Penis mit 'ner Wünschelrute

Ist das zu fassen?
Du lachst wenn du große Schwänze in den Arsch kriegst
Doch du bist so bescheuert, dass du dir nichmal über die Konsequenzen klar bist
Dir fehlt die Basis, der Stil und der Flow
Ich und Rap sind wie Friedmann und Koks
Einfach untrennbar, undenkbar wenn es anders wär, gib das Lenkrad her
Du dumme Sau, du wirfst dein bisschen Grips aus dem Fenster
Nein, nicht der Henker, ich bring dich kurz um wie Kiefer und Co
Tu auf cool, doch du kommst nicht an wie 'n Athlet der den Start schwänzt
Und sag, was fürn Feature? Niemals, nein, leck mich doch am Arsch, Mensch!
Ich behandel dich wie im Zuchthaus
Quäl und verhör dich denn du störst mich
Auf dir warn mehr Gays als auf nem Friseurtisch
Und du bist des Wahnsinns, gehst zum Arzt
Weil du nicht mehr normal bist, tust als würd bei dir was gehn
Das is ungeheuerlich, was der mir erzähl
Ich glaubs nich, überhaupt nichts, von dem was er da bringt ist sinnig

Es geht ruckzuck, runter auf den Hosenboden
Mein Freund, guck dich an, du liegst am Boden wie ein toter Vogel
Deine Seele ist blass, 'ne verwelkte rote Rose
Jede Stimmung nur ein Abziehbild des schon Gewohnten
Ebbe und Flut, immer heftiger trifft der Intervall
Immer kürzer die Abstände, du suchst das Glück mit Gewalt
Deine Seele ist heimatlos, ohne Wohnsitz
Du schläfst auf giftigen Inseln und träumst von hohlem Frohsinn
Du wärmst dich in Löffelstellung am Kohleofen
Und ein Mann mit Bart erzählt dir Geschichten in großen Strophen
Doch die Mitte fordert Tribut, sie vereist den Ofen
Deine Nabelschnur wird abgerissen und du heizt die Schore
Die Nadel fuhr direkt durch die Nabelschnur
Schwarz, rot, weiß, Schneewittchen blutet und es stach der Dorn
Es tropft in den Schnee, er schießt in einer Farbensonde
Durch die Vene, hundert rote Rosen in die Abendsonne

Sie versprechen kurze Wege, Abkürzung, der Druck ist dicht
Doch der Weg durch das Wurmloch zum Lichtplanet
Is' eng, wenn man merkt, dass die Schultern nicht durch den Trichter gehen
Wir weichen aus, verdrängen Probleme, die fiese Kälte
Im Sturm der Seele umschiffen wir Riesenfelsen (ja)
Glück kann da nicht greifen wie ein nasser Reifen
Und Fügungen schwingen durch die Luft wie 'ne Gitarrenseite
Gott lässt sich nicht ausrechnen, sei geduldig
Drogen versprechen die Wolken, doch bleiben den Himmel schuldig
Schwarz, weiß, heiß, kalt, hoch, tief, gut, schlecht
Heil, faul, vor, zurück, dunkel, hell, links, rechts
Wir unterwerfen uns der Gravitation, finden Mitte
Und suchen nicht länger künstlich nach Glück, überschminken Pickel
Ich schwimm' in die Flut, vertrau' dabei auf Jesus Christus
Und nehme die Wogen dieser Lebenswelle still im Rhythmus

„Nein, wir sind nicht schwul, wir sind Metrosexuell“
Schon klar du bist 'n echter Mann, es ist geil
Und zur Schlägerei kommst du immer allein

Du gehst nicht Fitnessstuido, Homes, du gehst Sonderschule
Für besonders intelligente Raketenforscher
In deinem geistigen Trabi überholst du jeden Porsche
Du bist ein übertalentierte Doktor im Kacke schmeißen
Ach du Scheiße, dein IQ ist minus hundert Fahrradreifen
Du bist hängen geblieben, wie ’n Raver auf’m schlechten Trip
Ich frag’ dich nach der Uhrzeit und du sagst mir wie das Wetter ist
Warum ist Thomas alles andere als Spitze?
Warum bleibt Thomas in der Sonderschule sitzen?
Kein Plan, warum will er seinen Banknachbarn anschlitzen?

Deutscher Rap ist für mich nur noch Blubb und Bla
Diese Welt ist Broke, ich bin in diesem tiefen Loch ein Star
J-E-S-U-S wir sind am Block am Start
Fick deine Crew, ich repräsentiere keine Postleitzahl
Ich steh’ für rote Fahne, rote Stutzen
Flagge zeigen, Steine werfen, vor Bullen auf den Boden spucken
Wie viel kannste hören, eins, zwei, drei scheiß Rapper
Deutsche Musik ist öde und spröde, wie ein Reiscracker
Captain Koks, ich bin dope und schick Rapper auf Urlaubsfahrt
Der Blick in die Wolken, fünf Finger auf dem Kulturauftrag (ja)
Alles wird besser mit guten Geschmack und Diktatur
Das ist deutsche Emanzipation, ich verwisch Hitlers Spur

Wo ist der Inhalt hin, Sprachrohr für die Unterschicht
Das Sprachrohr ist noch da, aber der Inhalt ist der Unterschied
Bruststücke, Oberschenkel, große Brüste
Klingt wie ’ne Bestellung bei Kentucky, nimm die rote Mütze
Deutsche Rapper sind nicht an der Wahrheit, dumm und so Scheiße
Dass sogar Dein Ghostwriter schreibt „Ich bin so scheiße“
Banjo räumt auf als wäre er ein netter Kindergärtner
Die Luft wird dünner, die Sonne heiß und der Winter härter
Nur die besten überleben den Piratenraub
Qualität das einzige Mittel gegen Datentausch
Limewire, MP3, Klingelton und Autotune
Ich scheiß' auf alles und mach einfach meine Augen zu

Und danach von deinem kleinen Bruder die Käsefüße
Erinnerst du dich, die Zeit ist nicht stehen geblieben?
Wir werden älter und älter, wir müssen Geld verdienen
Erinnerst du dich an das Laternen-dagegen-treten?

Goldene Schleier liegen lässig auf Erinnerungen
Wir wussten alle, was wir werden wollten, immer schon
Kindergarten, Schule, Studium und dann Karriere machen
Essentielle Dinge, es bleibt wenig Zeit für Nebensachen
Die letzte Stunde jeden Freitag war wie Zeitlupe
Treppe zu meinen Eltern, unendliche 102 Stufen
Ich wollte endlich 18 werden und dann raus hier
All die Dinge, von den meine Helden sangen, auch spüren
Als die Freiheit da war, war vor jedem Ding ein aber
Wie die erste die mir nah war, auf dem Riesenrad vom Jahrmarkt
Wenige wichtige Sätze liegen wie Perlen zwischen Gelaber
Weil der Teufel kein richtigen Namen hat
Gestern war ich 16 und morgen bin ich tot
Und die meiste Zeit dazwischen ein kompletter Idiot

Mit seiner schönen Skinnybitch und weiß nicht, wer sie wirklich ist
Hunger haben sie beide nicht, doch Hummer ist ihr Leibgericht
Und im trüben Abendlicht sieht man ihre Narben nicht

Sie wollte ihre Träume teilen, heute spielen sie Borderline
Fühlen sich leer und ausgebrannt und haben beide längst erkannt
Wir haben uns verannt

Ist oft nur ganz, ganz, ganz klein
Und die ganz, die ganz große Sehnsucht

Wie sie ihren Halt verloren und sich maßlos überschätzten
Weil sie beide schon verletzt waren, bevor sie sich verletzten
Wenn die Magic nicht mehr da ist
Wenn der Zauber langsam geht
Wenn der Vorhang sich zwar öffnet
Doch auf der Bühne keiner steht

Am Ende doch nur ganz klein
Und die ganz, die ganz große Sehnsucht

Writing home to tell you folks

Are nagging at you

As transparent as a ray

Ride the wave
Of their affection

Ooh we caught the moon from the sky
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes
And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one
Now there is nothing left that can numb me
Do you love me or do I run

Why don't you ask me to stay?
Ask me to stay

Looked so surprised when she said to me
Can you move the mountain then we can both see
She fell in my arms then I melted away
She said why won't you ask me to stay, ask me to stay?

Ooh we caught the moon from the sky
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes
And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one
Now there is nothing left that can numb me
Do you love me or do I run?

She picked up the pillow and lay down her head
We were loving like good friends again
Why don't you touch me, like we used to know
Move over and love me or let me go

And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one

And if the words don't tell me you love me
And if the night won't hold us as one
Now there is nothing left that can numb me
Do you love me or do I run

Why don't you ask me to stay?
Ask me to stay
Ask me to stay
Ask me to stay

As first you make a wish and pray that things will never change (ask me to stay)
And then we reach the point of being just good friends again (ask me to stay)

Saying that we're crazy

We spend all our time lying side by side
Going nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy doing nothing
We spend all our time running for our lives

Better things to do
I'll hold your hand

The whole world rushing by
I know that we're not crazy

See my future heading for the drain
So betcha wondering
Why I got a grin permanently on my face

Stumbling downhill fast
Wasting time that I just don’t have
But still I got a smirk
Like I’m up in first
When I’m in economy class

And I could be on my knees
Going from bad to worse
And all of my hopes and dreams
Come crashing down to earth
No matter how bad it seems…

Any time I wake up and I see your face
Every single morning it’s a sunny day
Don’t know how I ever lived life without you
But girl you got me running to the highest place
So they can hear me screaming from miles away
Gotta tell the world how I feel about you
Tell the world

Tell the world
Gotta tell the world how I feel about you

This ladder I’m ‘bout to climb
Need the highest roof that I can find
I’m headed for the top
Dodging all the rocks
Till I hit the clear blue sky

Every day I keep it to myself
I’m doing damage to my mental health
If I don’t let it go, think I might explode
Baby if I don’t get help

Like I can touch the sky, me and the birds up chilling
Yeah you got that lottery love – one in a million
One of a kind, many men spend their whole lifetime
Searching for the special someone but it ain’t my girl
So I don’t care if they look at me weird
I know just what I got and I’ma tell the world

Olu Dara,"Visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's ""the baddest""; a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But something must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some resting in peace and some are sitting in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping the effervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thieving
We'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere else stacking plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
Cause you never know when you're gonna go

I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels
And rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying ""fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage

See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Nas]
Let's go! Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Super kids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

[Olu Dara]
Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!)
Greatest man alive!

[Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and oh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

Greatest man? The great-greatest man alive

Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to

Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge

But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly

For it's

Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly

And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere,2002

My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

[Chorus: Common (Omar)]
Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
(Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! Gon' get it and get me that

First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collectors and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Every time you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks

Omar & the Howlers,"The world´s not picture perfect
And the streets ain´t paved with gold
And sometimes life gets a little too hard you know
You take the good times with the bad times

The heaven with the hell
And sometimes you just got to draw from the wishing well

A ride on a merry go round

Loop-de-loop round and round

One day you are the king of the bill
The next day you´re tumblin´ down
You take one step to the front line
Then it´s two steps to the back

And sometimes it seems like all the cards are stacked
Then from out of nowhere
Good luck come your way
And all your troubles vanish in the haze

Well,I have to admit
I'm glad that you're here
But I can't make the past
Just disappear
If you're back for good
I want you to be
Just let me know
What's in it for me

Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window

If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Omar Credle,"Intro: 
Mmm mmm yeah East coast no doubt 
Hip hop is somethin you live rap is somethin you do 

Verse One: 
Sorta distorted yo that's a fact 
Bad news gave a nigga in the mind contact 
I react on blues then use it within 
Blend conscious thoughts to make man mortal men 
see right ways to shell out this thing hip hop 
I pledge O.C. will only season the crops 
And never stop side drops or shot, I'm fiendin 
Covering more ground than news on CNN 
Being in the state of vast consumption in this game 
it's like drugs only quantity is run throughout 
Quality is walking through the valley of the reaper 
True deceivers are coming through your receivers 
Solid foundation to me is the true meaning of hardcore 
We need a little bit more... 

Chorus: 4X (layered on samples) 
Love and affection 
""What I represent is MC's gone mad"" --> Q-Tip 

Verse Two: 
I'm living in the time where life be a buck 
more worth than a child this rap shit suck 
Very few or should I say a handful of MC's 
Talk live, calling themselves kickin life, indeed 
I listen and take a look around only seein who's 
all about frontin and who's profilin 
While my glock I had, guess what I forsaw 
True for now I'm not surprised we didn't rise not at all 
Too many clicks for dolo, weak hitting solos 
My scrolls, they always paint visual photos 
O.C. worth more than a million 
Building nuff respect on the circuit of rap like Sicilians 
You might see the be	-boy when I walk New York 
Crew of brothers recognized so I stopped to talk 
Even the girls be hawkin sassi-fraskin askin 
What's going on and am I still rapping 
Things will change with hope galore 
But when it comes to rap, we need a little bit more... 

Chorus 
Verse Three: 
Big you hold your head and God bless your wife 
Got your little baby girl so I know she's alright 
I strike the mic anytime smashing yours 
Word are wise with wisdom with the width of a wall 
and way describe I prescribe antidotes 
Curing, reassuring my lyrical notes 
Make an impact a fact on the backs of men 
Magnified to the fullest magnificent 
Brilliant, my composition is efficiently prone 
to set fire to a waste and char your ass to the bone 
Figure, I trigger, bigger, bold bad men 
Come against O you'll be walking away a sad man 
Miles of red tape had me stunted for growth 
but when I took off on wax I maxed the globe 
Didn't happen so far, respect be just building 
Watch for the devils in the forms of chameleons 
Kick the raw slow down on the score 
Think before you write or find yourself falling 
Final calling, you're spreading infection 
When it comes to rap, we need a little bit more...

I love suffering, I love struggle, I love pain
Cause what don't kill you make you stronger nigga
And I'm as strong as they come

[Chorus]
I love the streets
Cause that's what made me me
Without the streets baby I couldn't eat
I love the streets
And although we was po'
Without struggle boy you can't grow
I love the streets
And even though we sold drugs
And paid for it in blood
I love the streets
No matter what happend to me
My hood or your hood, it's all good
I love the streets

[Sticky Fingaz]
Right now my life don't mean an awful lot
If I died today who think the world gon' stop?
There's a million niggaz just like me on the block
It's either entertainment or sports or sellin that rock
Think the judge gon' take ya word over a cops?
You be just another nigga that they stick in the box
But we are the streets, what other choice we got?
Then to go hard, give them niggaz all we got
Fuck that, as long as I got breath in my lungs
I'm livin my life, waitin for my death to come
If you made it out the hood then God blessed you son
But if your fam there you ain't out lesson one
Gotta spread around nigga that's what's real to me
Turn on the news, swear the shit be killin me
y'all from the streets probly ain't feelin me
You could take me out the hood but it's still in me

[Chorus]

[Omar Epps]
Fools is fake, I come through with the ghoulish face
Take small step, big moves I make
I could put it to your face then choose your fate
Everyday Thanksgivin, for me two plates
Yeah we do grace, God bless it all
From the mess hall to the boulervard with the dead dogs
When we cough and spit, guns they speak
The same language is the bullets, who talkin shit?
Yo Pac if ya listenin they got the game twisted
Talkin bout the hate you gave little infants
Fuck everybody here today, place ya ways
And ya fade away like the memory of Gotti
Take it back to '90, last year highschool
Didn't graduate though, still had to make dough
That's my word, word for word I understood it all
Had big dreams though the hood is small

[Chorus]",I Love da Streets,2003
Omar Epps,"Chorus: Detroit Diamond]
If you ain't got no dough
Then what you here for?
If you ain't got no hos
Then what you here for?
If you ain't got no smoke
Then what you here for?
If you ain't sittin on chrome
Keep it rollin, keep it movin

[Sticky Fingaz]
I'm here to get them sevens on twentys, more guns than cash
Blunts than hash, be glad I ain't down to my last
I turn to a different person, face under the mask
Or either out on the grind or I'm up in some ass
Gettin them hos, fuck that, I'm gettin that dough
And stackin it up, a nigga front, I'm slappin him up
Backin him up, beef ain't no patchin it up
I'm clappin you up, while morticians wrappin you up
I'm laughin it up wit hos that be happy to fuck
Packed in my truck, passin up a half of a dutch
I'm slappin they butts, can't wait to get them back to the hut
I'm here for Other People Money nigga, that's what's up

[Omar Epps]
O.E., Big High Scene, whatever you like
Old deal, slash by and competitive type
I'm better than Mike, the Jordans is up in the shelf
Next to a few rings and a couple of belts
Got a black widow chick, she be lovin me well
You could hate me, shit, cause I'm lovin myself
A glutton for wealth, these young niggaz fuckin they health
All excited over pussy, like it's somethin to sell
y'all dudes is geeks, y'all really don't influence the streets
The streets influence the slang that you fluently speak
Confusin to me, tryna be somethin your not
When them slugs pop you the one duckin them shots
I go hard like them youngins that be huggin the block
I go hard like Humphrey wit a glove and a glock
I'm somethin ya not, quite frankly you could love it or not
Certified number one nigga up in your spot

[Chorus]

[Rio]
A'yo remember Candy? White too dope camry
Big booty wit the small panties
Used to smuggle yay' for the homie Randy
Got the plushed out crib off the water in Miami
She almost had me, I was gone off the fatty
In love wit the way she called me daddy
Had she, known about the city where I'm from
And I ain't goin home til my bankrole's done
Motherfucker's think pimpins for fun
I ain't done til my greenery's weighin a ton
And we could smoke big weed, just lay in the sun
Hellafied when we ride, weed makin me buzz
Let's hit the room right after the club
That's what I'm here for

Me he vuelto loco desde que no estas
Como quisiera que estuvieras aquí
Para tenerte y poder ser feliz

No se como me enamoré
La culpa es de este frágil corazón
Como un tatuaje pegado a mi
Pues tus caricias me hacen sentir

Que soy un loco
Enamorado de tus dulces besos
Que si no fuera tan sólo por eso
Mi vida sería infeliz

Que soy un loco
Que no resiste estar tan lejos
Que cada vez que miro una estrella
Me recuerda más a ti

Sufro cada vez que te vas
Soy diminuto en esta inmensa ciudad
El tiempo se detiene sin ti
Soy una roca rodando hasta el fin

Busco y no te puedo encontrar
Y mis vacíos no los puedo llenar
Por que tu ausencia es un veneno tan vil
Que en mi agonía no puedo morir

Por que soy un loco
Enamorado de tus dulces besos
Que si no fuera tan sólo por eso
Mi vida sería infeliz

Que soy un loco
Que no resiste estar tan lejos
Que cada vez que miro una estrella
Me recuerda más a ti

Que soy un infeliz sólo y sin ti
No dejo de sentir que te amo hasta morir

Y aunque tú nunca lo aceptes
Sabes que siempre fue así

No sé, no quiero ni pensarlo
Que tú fingias al besarnos
Que cuando yo te amaba
Tú no sentías nada
Y que este tiempo nuestro
Ha sido en vano
Ya sé que dices ser de nadie
Y estar conmigo no te obligo
Si ya estás decidida
Y es hoy la despedida
Dime mi amor que error he cometido

Omar Lye-Fook,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds

Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space - yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase - yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He gon see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

No fear of destruction

Omar Lye-Fook,"My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard 'cause yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the Metropolitan

The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon

The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan

Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walkin' to liquor stores in moccasins
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collecters and the roaches workin' your nerves

It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
He can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent

And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink

Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white and 1's new sneaks

I'm in, I'm in too deep, deep to sleep, can't knock the hustle
The hustle caught up in the hustle, I'm gettin' high
Can't knock the hustle, the hustle
I'm in, I'm in too deep, deep to sleep, can't knock the hustle
The hustle gotta hustle up I got to have it

Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sow clothes
Some hobo at the junction inbetween cars
Some enter in functions in between stars
Some teach, some preach sayin' they seen god

Some put they money up, against me odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin' El Derado's bumpin' El Debarge
Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, its the hustle

Omar Pedrini,"Come ogni giorno 
Andata e ritorno 
Nell'inferno intorno a me

Con il mio stile 
Musica in vinile 
Cerco un mondo che non c'è

Ma c'è una ragione 
Se come un coglione 
Perdo tempo intorno a te

I tuoi giochi infantili 
Polveri sottili 
Ma un uomo oggi che cos'è

Perchè ancora non so 
Ci sei o no 
Vuoi dirlo adesso 
Che

Dimmi non ti amo 
Dillo piano piano 
Vieni qui vicino 
Dimmi il mio destino

Dimmi non ti amo 
E me ne andrò lontano 
Dimmelo davvero 
Dammi quel veleno

Eterno morire 
Voglio capire se quel fuoco ancora c'è

La calda atmosfera della prima sera 
Brucia ancora dentro me

Ciò che forse già so 
Ci sei o no 
Vuoi dirlo adesso 
E

Dimmi non ti amo 
Dillo piano piano 
Vieni qui vicino 
Dimmi il mio destino

Dimmi non ti amo 
Io sarò lontano 
Uno sparo, un suono 
Per finire un uomo

E se ancora non so 
Ci sei o no

Omar Pedrini,"Spengo il telefono
Ora sto un po' con me
La strada del Brennero
Mi aspetta immobile
Per andare verso la città
Dove andavamo insieme
Nell'estate del 93'

Amico dove sei
Con le spalle larghe e i piedi buoni
Con tutto quel fiato nei polmoni
A Bologna con l'Italia intera
Con la sua ferita sempre accesa

La notte è fragile
Confonde un po' le idee
Se l'imprevedibile
Segna le pagine
Di quel libro scritto anche per noi
Che siam cresciuti insieme

Calpestando il mondo un po' così come eravamo noi
Quelli fuori corso, quelli fuori, ma volevamo essere i migliori
Poi giocarsi tutto in una sera
Tra le gambe di una cameriera

E mi chiedo cosa resterà
Tra le luci di questa città
Resto solo io coi miei pensieri
Penso a quello che eravamo ieri

Cerco un po' di vita tra i lampioni
Chiudo gli occhi e penso a Frank Antoni

Fuoco a volontà 
Fuoco a volontà

Hai lasciato dietro di te

Omar Rodriguez,"Nací mirando para arriba el 23 de febrero
Después de estudiar tanto termine siendo rapero
Mi familia es grande en mi casa somos ocho
Y la clase media baja no recibe plan ocho
Es normal que mi comportamiento no les cuadre
Y mas cuando el gobernador desempleo a mi madre
Me desahogo cuando escribo mi letra es franca
Pa' no terminar explotando en la Casa Blanca
Mis rimas te ponen tenso y te dan calambre
Yo soy el que hago que coman sin que tengan hambre
Mezclo lo que veo con lo melódico
Yo estoy aqui para contarte lo que no cuentan los periódicos
Es el momento de la música independiente
Mi disquera no es Sony, mi disquera es la gente
Las personas que me siguen y escuchan el mensaje
Por eso me defienden a los puños y sin vendaje

Calma pueblo que aquí estoy yo
Lo que no dicen lo digo yo
Lo que sientes tu lo siento yo
Porque yo soy como tu, tu eres como yo
Calma pueblo que aquí estoy yo
Lo que no dicen lo digo yo
Lo que sientes tu lo siento yo
Porque yo soy como tu, tu eres como yo

A ti te ofende lo que escribo
A mi me ofende tu playback, que estés doblando en vivo
A mi me ofende cuando tu sobornas a la radio
Con plata con dinero pa' que te suenen a diario
Ni siquiera los Beatles tenían cuatro canciones
Sonando el mismo tiempo en las radio estaciones
Esto lo puede ver hasta un bizco
Tu vendes porque tu mismo te compras tus propios discos
No me digas que no si a mi me han ofrecido hacer eso
La mitad de los artistas deberían estar presos
A mi no me ofende que por hablar mucho me llames loco
Tu dices poco porque sabes poco

Calma pueblo que aquí estoy yo
Lo que no dicen lo digo yo
Lo que sientes tu lo siento yo
Porque yo soy como tu, Duro!

Yo uso al enemigo a mi nadie me controla
Le tiro duro a los gringos y me auspicia coca cola
De la canasta de frutas soy la única podrida
Adidas no me usa, yo estoy usando adidas
Mientras bregue diferente, por la salida entro
Me infiltro en el sistema y exploto desde adentro
Todo lo que les digo es como el Aikido
Uso a mi favor la fuerza del enemigo
Ahora quítate el traje falda y camiseta
Despójate de prendas marcas etiquetas
Pa' cambiar el mundo desnuda tu coraje
La honestidad no tiene ropa ni maquillaje
No me hablen de carteles ni de los sopranos
La mafia mas grande vive en el Vaticano
Con el truco de la fé se cogen a la gente
Se cogen a cualquiera que piense diferente
A mi no me cogen yo creo en lo que quiera
Creo en la gente, creo en mi bandera
Creo que los que me señalan con el dedo
Me tienen miedo porque yo no tengo miedo

Calma pueblo que aquí estoy yo
Lo que no dicen lo digo yo
Lo que sientes tu lo siento yo
Porque yo soy como tu, tu eres como yo
Calma pueblo que aquí estoy yo
Lo que no dicen lo digo yo

Pena inmensa que envenena,

Que endurece, que lacera,
Que convierte a la princesa
En la más anciana reina.

Donde crece en flor la piña
Perfuman las flores
Y arrulla un palmar

Mirando el cielo azulado
Un guajiro enamorado
Sus penas de amores
Se puso a cantar

Ay ven, amorosa guajira
Que ya nada me inspira
Ni el canto del ave
Que surca el azul

Ay ven a alegrar mi bohío
Que hasta el lecho del río
Se ha vuelto a sombrío
Porque faltas tú

Ven, que mi blanca casita
Se ha quedado solita
Y al verla tan triste
Me causa dolor

Ay ven que la tarde se muere
Y mi alma no quiere
Preciosa guajira, vivir sin tu amor

Sin tu amor",Amorosa Guajira,2004

Amor que nunca yo olvidaré

Escucharas el sin son que cantara para ti

Habanera ven
Ven pronto pa mi bohío
Habanera ven
Dueña del corazón mio

Esa brillante ciudad
Olvida todo lo suyo
Ven aquí donde el cocuyo
Refulge en la oscuridad

Y rompe la soledad
Habitual de la pradera
Una tonada siquiera
Que signo de libertad

Yo siempre me acordare de los versos
De aquel bar, yo siempre me acordare
De los versos de aquel bar don Juan Napoles del Fajardo
Llamado el cucalambe

A mi la canción me inspira
Por su romántico sello
A mi la canción me inspira
Por su romántico sello

Pero si admirar lo bello de una tonada guajira
Brilla de un bardo de un bardo la lira
Como un sol, como un sol en la mañana
Basta la doctrina, la doctrina martiana

Cantando música nuestra
Que es mas linda y es cubana

Y tres que hoy yo vivo en la ruina de un silencio
Que va dejándome sin voz
Lo que no entiendo
Es que ahora vengas otra vez
A prometerme, una vida entera

En que momento de mi largo caminar
Perdimos eso
Verdad que soy difícil
Pero he sido para ti
Lo único profundo
También verdad

Y yo guardándome el secreto

Y no sufrir

Perdimos eso

En los azules
Y me enfrentaba a tempestades
Y ahora no se si tu exististe
O eres solo un sueño que yo tuve
Pero es que hay cosas
Que no consigues olvidar jamas
No importa el tiempo que eso dure

Lo diferente de los dos

Que lo dure amor duro

No quiero guardarme lo que siento

Yo te vi llegar flotando a un palmo del suelo
Tus labios rumbo a los míos

Omarion,"Second you caught my eye, 
Girl I couldn't deny, that you got me on fire, baby. 
Something 'bout the way you walk. 
I just can't get enough, girl you got that good stuff. 
I think I'm loosing my mind. Girl can we just talk, baby?

In case you haven't noticed, your body's got me focused, 
Just want to let you know, ""My name's Omarion!"" Oh

[Chorus]
It's nice to meet ya, baby girl you're a keepa, 
And I'm never gonna let you go, said I'm never gonna let you go, 
'cause you're a keepa. You're something special, 
Feeling you since I met you, and I'm never gonna let you go, 
Said I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause you're a keepa. 

Girl, it's official. Really, really want to get with you. 
Girl, like no other, girl that's in here tonight. 
Et's go somewhere quiet, get to know each other more private, 
Whatever it is about ya, just feels so right, baby. 

I like your conversation, just want to take my time 
And come over 'round you girl. I gotta have you in my world.

""Come here, baby!""

The horns are making me horny. 
Sugar, darlin', I adore thee. 
These other girls are boring, really don't got nothing for me. 
Freaky in the worst way, 
Me and Rick James got the same birthday. 
Simply means I'll grill you from Thursday to Thursday. 
7 days, 1 week, 168 hours. 
I got the power, to make you shout, 
But I'll knock yo' ass sour. 
Scream, scream, permanent on the team, like a Bantu, or a duke, 
Or a Just For Me! 
No lie, relax, lay down, you need a t-shirt. 
You can sleep in the bed with me, 
At the foot of the bed, with your feet first. 
And, I will twirk you, you the only good smoking, 
Puffing better than purple, girl. 
I hope you fertile, girl. 
So we can have a baby boy or a baby girl. To Chuck E. 
Cheese and Disneyworld. 
I'm just saying you're a keepa. 
From the day Big Boi was born, till the day I see the grim reaper. 
I'm keepin' her. (Ha ha)

Omarion,"I can't live with you, but I can't live without ya
Not breathing with you,it hard to breathe without you
Think to myself everyday
How they slit us apart,for different men that shared the same heart
It had happen this way
Us go our separate way
Would be lying if I said I didn't miss the co-fax days
Sit and think to myself how this thing has changed my life
(Damn we was suppose to be boys for life)

[Chorus]
This is my growin' pains
Cause by the fortune and fame
Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever
Never thought that we'd go our separate ways
Now look how things have change
Looks like there never ever be the same
So hard to explain what went wrong?
After we were together for too long
Now, never be the same again
Tell me how this thing happened
Damn, this is my growin pain

Some people don't know
That I tried it again
Even though I was sour (sour)
I tried to be a man (man)
I couldn't hold the grudge,knowing in my heart I still had love
But if ya'll knew what went down you'd be like like what the fuck
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
Loyalty, honesty, where did we go wrong?
I guess it was gods grace for me to be alone.

[Chorus]

How could this ever be,them no longer apart of me?
What did you do to turn them other boys against me?
I just have one thing to say
What you do comes back your way

So many things we said,so many false statements about me against my manger Chris.
Sometimes I just feel like giving up.
Like I was nothing and like I couldn't go on without them.
But now I feel like god is looking down on me and he should carry my soul.
As I take this solo journey,I never meant for any of this to happen I'm sorry.

Wish you would've said somethin'
Before we got this far, I
And I wouldn't be caught up in
Another situation that really got me breakin'
And I don't know what I'm gonna do

I know, I know you see me
See me on Music TV, you're makin' money
Makin' money doin' your thing but I don't
I don't wanna up and leave
And try to be what who the media says

I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby, I can't leave her, no

I don't want somethin' that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
Know that everybody thinks that it might sound crazy
But I, I love my baby
I don't want something that's made

I know you think I'm lyin' every time that I say
I don't wanna see you cryin' all because of me, oh
The thought of me and you is ill
But with her, it's somethin' real
And I can't let that go, oh, no

I know you see me
See me on Music TV, you're makin' money
Makin' money doin' your thing
But I don't wanna up and leave
'Coz of somethin' that the media says

I don't want somethin' that's made for TV

Omarion,"Midnight

It started out like any other day
But it was anythin' but
Somethin' 'bout the way the moon was shinin'
Somethin' seems so different, no

Got in my car but didn't have no reason
Swear I was drivin' but somethin' else was leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The next thing, you won't believe

At 9 o'clock, I saw her
By 10, I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock, it happened, I gotta blame

Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
(Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?
(Midnight)

It's 12 o'clock, tick tock tick, the clothes drop
She's on top and I don't even wanna stop, no
Made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight

Still here I know I'm in trouble
But I'ma finish what I started
My heart is tellin' me to leave here
But my body's sayin' stay longer

We goin' strong while my cell phone's blowin' up
I know it's wrong but somethin' else is leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The sex is just too good to leave

At 1 o'clock, I'm in it
2 o'clock, still in it
Then 3 o'clock, I'm finished
At 4 o'clock, I'm drivin' home, I gotta blame

Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
(Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?

Made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight

What have ya done, it's 5 A.M., oh
Hookin' up wit somebody that you don't even know
How you gonna get yourself outta this one
You got a girl at home

I can blame it on my car breakin' down or
I can say I was workin' late and didn't know
That you was waitin' up, I never showed up
Girl, I know it's my fault

Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to

If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?

Omarion,"You know sometimes you get in situations
And when you make that move
You gotta be committed
She know what I mean

We were better off friends
But the magic of the night had us holding each other tight
We should've kept it right there
But the movie got boring and you wore those jeans I like

I glanced at your pretty feet
Your sexy hands rubbing on my chest
Should I kiss you? I heard a voice say yes
Next, we were undressing not realizing
We shouldn't be doing this, no

What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?

What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?

They say some things are better off as just a fantasy
What came over me?
I did not lose control, it must've been those jeans
It was the way she fit in those jeans

I can't even remember if it was good or not
All I know is that our temperature was boiling hot
Can't believe I just made love to my dear friend
I pray that this isn't damaging in the end

Lack of communication
Got us both in the situation
Now there's no way out, no way out
'Cause we can't turn back time, no

What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?

What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?

We're staring at the ceiling
With the cover tuck pulled up to our necks
Like o
Should've never let you come here alone, no, no, no

I know I just enjoy seeing you naked
Now I can't look, now I can't look
We did this, it's a price we have to pay
Now there's nothing to say

She was a friend of mine fine, slim waistline
I never thought she'd be feeling me, never seen the sign
My homie said I'll eventually hit it a while back
I told him na, she friend, it ain't like that

I found myself staring at that ass a couple times
Threw without a sight in mind, knowing her since I was nine
But a moment alone in a soft bed changed everything
Never thought that we go to this extreme

Lack of communication
Got us both in the situation
Now there's no way out, no way out
We can't turn back time, no

What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?

What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?

What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?

Are we doing

Once I get her back to my bachelor pad

Now if I hit your girl thats too bad
You so lame and she likes my swag
Make her do flips like a acrobat
Once I get her back to my bachelor pad

She told me I was better then that and this is the new world she never bend out and stretch
Neva got wet in the jacuzzi heart shaped never seen her pride relax
Sneak in the back never seen nothing like this before
Platinum forces with the royal doors
Stacks so clean you can eat off the floor

Let me take you on a private tour
I don't even got door knobs on my door
They just move when they hear my voice
Yup that's Egyptian marble on that floor
So my crib got chinchilla hips I swear come take a feel yo chill in there
Well the liquor might spill in there I got a movie room we can make a film in there (ha ha)
You know the pad got a elevator in it

So ma just come through and get elevated in up in here
For quite a minute I even ain't seen the kitchen
I just hit the intercom and tell the waiter get it (get it)
I got 20 man staff
That can get it right when I need a mid-night snack
Tonight ma you goin' be my mid-night snack
Turn my room to a coupe watch the roof retract

We walk they light up like Billy Jean video
And my bar got Neon lights
So when I lick her I'm a lick her dance for hundreds on the dance flo
I got a dancin' pole up on my dance flo'
So it ain't no tellin' where my hands go
So if my hands go low
Then let ya pants go
Seven star see I'm on the 12th flow

Its the antidote
I got a indoor pool ma come and get ya panties soaked (Yup!)
Hop in and splash once I get ya back to my bachelor pad

Or do I just beat around the bush about it
Or should I? Let Lil' Ronnie tell him for me
No I feel obligated, That's my homie
What would you do if you was me mayne?
Tell him the truth or let it be mayne?

Never will I sound like he is not me though
I'm on my own dick my no hoe
Couldn't be in the same room as octane
I see you doin' ya thing but you ain't the same

Wipe off the gucci shades yeah I can see well
Touch my mula I'll choke ya like Spreewell

Anything I want outta life I'm pursuing it
Niggas ain't respecting the game, they just ruin it
I'm a bring hip hop back, watch how I'm doing this
Flood the whole game, then float like Noah
Slip in the well and sing hymns like Jonah

Turn it into bright lights along with cheers
Never will I move like he who is not, I'm on my own shh, I'm on fire
Hot like flame, the flow is not the same
I'm the connect, respect the left lane
Te pace has been set, ain't no stopping me
Jewelery alone can buy property
Get money split it 2 ways, the new face tycoon status what can you say
It's irrelevant man, we selling out stadiums

She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si si bunoes bonita.
You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaeton the whole club.

I see you party in the streets,
See my myself climbing in the
Seats the hood is like heaven now reminiscing
Them days when I thought about throwing on a towel
The night before the month was like Christmas
This kid keep hustling me sometimes I felt
Like I couldn't breath I would have to sit back
And play naive and it hurt watching my mum struggle
Trust me when you broke and hungry it's hard
To stay out of trouble it's a survival of the fittest
Whatever it took to bring money to the table
I did it even my girl lost faith in me
Left me out trapped in this negative energy
Listening deeply but I have to keep on
Moving I refuse to let this darkness, cath up to me

Puerto Rico is where she come from
She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si bunoes bonita.
You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club.

Dowled up but it was just a distraction
Even the streets never gave us a little time to relax
Writing my rhymes to a vibe scap in the corner
Wrapped me like a cake I'm trying to be this super man
In the ghetto get this paper take this music
To a whole new level trouble found me now
I found myself in Puerto Rico spy got hot
I had to roll living with my paps
I really don't no missing my lady try not to tell it show
Her new man telling her I would probably never blow
Wanted to tell to the flow I know robbin' it stay in the zone
And move hard or go home open my eyes now
I see myself on the rock miens bonitas
Everywhere I wanna ride

She asked me do I love her that recorded song

That I will be getting money making music
So these hatters wouldn't take nothing off me
When the chicks wouldn't holla I just
Play them back all I had was a flow and a ball
Cap, watch right across the room
Thinking they will be dancing to me soon so
I'm in the game selling the streets though rapped
So hard that I'm in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico

All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream, cause a dream's unstoppable

I could've gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close

Storms and Rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up cause I know

Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream,
cause a dream's unstoppable

Dream
That you can fly,
Dream
That you can climb
Dream
A mountain, all you gotta do is just
Dream
That you can win,
Dream
With Confidence
Dream
To the very end cause dreamers become champions

Until it's real,

Don't let them kill your

Don't ever break
Don't let it slip away cause all you gotta do

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
Dream, then you can do anything
Dream, you're halfway to destiny
Dream, dream's unstoppable

So I got this situation
My girl's been hangin' out 
With this other girl
Let me talk about it

Where is my girlfriend?
I been callin'
She ain't picked up
Somethings fishy
She won't hear me
Now I'm sittin' here
Like what the fuck?

This is too unusual
She never did it like this before
She usually calls me back within the hour
I bet she's out with what's her name
The girl that doesn't have a man
Assumptions in my mind got me confused girl

Sometimes she can't keep a pretty hands off me
But when shes with her girlfriend she don't even speak
She could spot a pretty girl faster than I can
Tells me that she loves me but I'm tryna' understand

[Repeat: x3]
I think my girl is
Bi ay ay ay ay ay

Should I say goodbye?
Should I give it a try?
I think my girl is

Secret conversations in my face
They talking code
Matchin' tattoos, to the bathroom
At the same time they go

This is too unusual
Never been like this before
Affection ain't the same when she's around
I wonder if I'm trippin'
Visions of them kissin'
Now I wanna know the truth cause

Sometimes she can't keep a pretty hands off me
But when shes with her girlfriend she don't even speak
She could spot a pretty girl faster than I can

Omarion,"I'm staring at the pillow where you slept last night
It was almost like you were laying there
And the shirt that you wore of mine
Took it off and threw it across the chair
Now its kinda hard to get you off my mind
When I keep seeing you everywhere
For example like that lipstick on that glass of wine, damn
Sitting right over there

And I cant play it off like we're friends like I used to
No, I cant pretend like I used to
So now I'm laying in my bed thinking bout you
And what do I do

Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you
Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
I feel so weak, so hard to breath
But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
I'm coming down with the case of you

Trying not to think about you only got me missing you more
And loneliness ain't no cure
Though it was over about now
But no, not yet
Pulled the covers up to my head
Now im feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry
With just the thought of you on my mind
Its kinda crazy, what a mess im in
I cant believe this is happening

And I cant play it off like we're friends like I used to
No, I cant pretend like I used to
So now I'm laying in my bed thinking bout you

But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
I'm coming down with the case of you

Now this ain't no common cold
What I feel is original
And I know there is a remedy
When you bring your body back to me

But thetell you by the greyhound
She can  reward is major, so on and so forth
She can show you how to stay down
I can tell you 'bout to break down
VS1's all in my bitch, watch face now?
Straight G's for your low esteem
8 P's for the whole team
As I run away from my obituary
Walking in the shit, that'll get you buried
Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley
Baselines shoot at niggas, act wisely
Get the picture, niggas getting richer now
Living next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle
Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa
Come to the coca, callate la boca
They let shit slide when my nigga won't
Remember God forgives and them triggers don't

Aw baby it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl

Lear jets to the fights now
Bellagio crap table with the dice out
Floor seats at the Heat game
Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game
South beach making love on the rooftop
Fucking to the rhythm, got her singing like she Jill Scott
I'm just a nigga with a attitude
Earning revenue through different avenues
One of my soldiers died in Attica
Anything other than a ride is out of character
Top down and it feels right
I could tell you what a dope boy feels like
I could tell you that he never sleeps
He may smile but it's never sweet
Swisha burning at his fingertips
Tears on the inside but they never drip
God forgives and the courts don't
Sneak in an appeal when the courts won't

Gave her what she want, now she need me

Now I'm MIA

Ah fuck her I don't care
Told me that she loved me, yeah
I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare

I call her up but she won't answer

Now I'm MIA

I be a rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya
Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma
I'm a real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me
The more attention you give em, the more options they seek

I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch, I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinemann, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean

Never gon' know so

No, no, no, no

This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5’11?, what the fuck you guys scared of
I’m a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get ‘em outta their garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, natty dread, got no barber
I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us

Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest, he’ll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me?
I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women
I am existing
I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with

It started out like any other day
But it was anythin' but
Somethin' 'bout the way the moon was shinin'
Somethin' seems so different, no

Got in my car but didn't have no reason
Swear I was drivin' but somethin' else was leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The next thing, you won't believe

At 9 o'clock, I saw her
By 10, I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock, it happened, I gotta blame

Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
(Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?

It's 12 o'clock, tick tock tick, the clothes drop
She's on top and I don't even wanna stop, no
Made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight

Still here I know I'm in trouble
But I'ma finish what I started
My heart is tellin' me to leave here
But my body's sayin' stay longer

We goin' strong while my cell phone's blowin' up
I know it's wrong but somethin' else is leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The sex is just too good to leave

At 1 o'clock, I'm in it
2 o'clock, still in it

Hookin' up wit somebody that you don't even know
How you gonna get yourself outta this one
You got a girl at home

I can blame it on my car breakin' down or
I can say I was workin' late and didn't know
That you was waitin' up, I never showed up
Girl, I know it's my fault

Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to

If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?

Said he got 80 johns, who to call but me?
So I called my dogs, cause my dogs gotta eat
Let him off the leash now it's time to feast
Got McDonald's money but I'm tryna eat Philippe's
Tired of all this drought shit, this broke shit ain't me
If this thing go right, it's gon' put me on my feet, where I need to be
I ain't lying Meek, this nigga move, I'm leaving him
I got some loose cannons and they all agreeing with me
Black glove, black hoodies, I brought the team with me
Black strap, MAC-10, brought the machines with me
Now we slidin' down the North, to 23rd and Berks
Cause Papi he got that work
Young hitters they with me, they tryna murk
I just tell them ""chill we gon' take him for what he worth""

Load up the AK and the mothafucka MAC-11
Hundred thangs to a dope boy, fucking blessing
Hit up Boobie told him ""meet me on 183rd""
Funny how 187 get your boy hundred burst
Bang, Dade County niggas ain't a game
We call them sticks missed calls they gon' let 'em ring
SK's I just grabbed last month nigga
My new shooter I ain't prayed in a month nigga
Got the devil in him, all he know is M 1
Told them bring back all the paper in 10 tons
See all the boys selling dope just a day job
We dropping bodies how they really pay the bill boy
So papi how you want it? Body bag, clo' cask', keep it clean, let em live, bring back all the dope and cash
Paper right on sight, thats just how it go
Tell them how you want it papi

Omen,"In the days of darkness men feared not the sword and the lance
Nor did he fear the beast of fire... He feared...
THE AXEMAN!!

Once we lose our precious dream there's nothing left to fight
Now you are bound and gagged one last meal is your final right
Many have tried you're not the only one waiting for that final mourn
The future's set dawn is coming time is now the mask will be worn

[Chorus:]

Bow down to the axeman hooded figure of mortal fear
Bow down to the axeman sun is rising time is near

Darkness fills your parting soul mystical power was yours alone
You stole the king's crown of gold claiming his kingdom for your own
Good and evil clash in battle armies fight into the night
Steel and iron ring out the warning powers on the side of right

[Chorus]

The sign of the king unites us all our fight for freedom rages on
Against warriors of light many fall our dreams of peace are not all gone
Once we lose that precious dream there's nothing left to fight
Now you are bound and gagged one last meal is your final right

[Chorus]




",The Axeman,1984
Omen,"She comes to me in the middle of the night wearing only silk and lace
Bearing the gifts of sex and wine with a burning embrace
Long wavy hair of flaxen gold surrounds me in a dream
She's too young to be so bold I wanna make her scream

[Chorus:]

Be my wench tonight oh maiden so fair
Be my wench tonight pleasure is yours if you dare

Don't you worry that I won't give in the proof is right there in your hand
Some will say you are living in sin but they don't understand
The truth is you have nothing to lose woman come here to me
If it is lust and desire you choose I'll set your spirit free

[Chorus]

Live in the moment passions run wild what pleasure it brings
You have the body and face of a child you've never felt such things
The truth is you have nothing to lose woman come here to me
If it is lust and desire you choose I'll set your spirit free

[Chorus]




",Be My Wench,1984
Omen,"If you know what I am thinking deep inside my mind
Maybe you will take a chance not fearing what you'll find

[Chorus:]

You bring out the beast in me woman you are hot and I'm on fire
All night we set the world ablaze you bring out the beast in me

Your eyes flash intention you move into my sights
I will deliver the hardness we hunger for the nights

[Chorus]

Scratch my back I'll scratch yours too
With all this pleasure we need black and blue
I never learned a thing all I do is take
The game is over I'm burning at the stake

[Chorus]

If you scratch my back I'll scratch yours too
With all this pleasure we need black and blue
I never learned a thing all I do is take
The game is over I'm burning at the stake

",Bring Out the Beast,1984
Omen,"Ride against the wind shameless killer in the night
Rape another village before the break of light
Trample down the ashes grind them with your hate
Take another heplpess life before it's too late

[Chorus:]

Death rider you've taken the earth by storm
Death rider out of sin and hatred you were born

We all know the reason you haven't any soul
None can fight your power the key to hell you stole
Upon a flaming steed you ride sickle tight in hand
In darkness you were born in darkness you make your stand

[Chorus]

Ride against the wind shameless killer in the night
Rape another village before the break of light
Trample down the ashes grind them with your hate
Take another helpless life before it's too late

[Chorus]




",Death Rider,1984
Omen,"The sweat just pours from your body combat is nigh
Into the arena we march to die

Your blood spills to the ground your body feels broken
You face the earth and breathe the dust again
Your head is spinning you feel another blow
You hear the steel rip you to the bone

[Chorus:]

In the arena oh mighty gladiator
In the arena you are the chosen warrior

In armor and mail you were born to fight
Learned how to kill keeping the gold in sight
Who can match your fury none can give you such pain
Part man and beast time to battle again

[Chorus]

Your head is spinning you feel another blow
You hear the steel rip you to the bone
Your blood spills to the ground your body feels broken
You hear the steel rip you to the bone

[Chorus]




",In the Arena,1984
Omen,"Off in the distance the church bell rings and the raven spreads his wings
Shadows of steel fall silent in the gloom one last full moon
The future is lost payment for the crime there's no way out this time

[Chorus:]

No sound from the gallows no sound from the shadows tall
Only silence till morning only silence till churchbells toll
No sound from the gallows

You feel the cold of the stone below your feet now your sorrow is complete
Have your last meal water and bread as the last rites are read
A new dawn approaches take your last breath you are one step from death

[Chorus]

Up to the steps mobs cheer you on who will cry when you're gone
Bound hand and foot the hood is in place pray for God's holy grace
Off in the distance hear the churchbell ring now the angels will sing

[Chorus]




",Last Rites,1984
Omen,"In shadows creeping, while you're sleeping the demon caresses your soul
Dreams are the place where you meet face to face
With all of the fears that you know
You walk in a daze you can't see through the haze
It's time that you started to run
Back through the ages you turn back the pages before God created the sun

[Chorus:]

Do you know his name he is the founder of death to us all
Do you know who to blame he leads us to slaughter and laughs as we fall

With arms outreaching, banshees screeching the wind it howls out your name
You run till you're heaving it's hard when you're breathing
Only the smoke from hell's flame
Darkness is calling you down you are falling
You're hoping that soon it will end
The nightmare is breaking the strength you are faking
The truth comes to mind once again

[Chorus]

[repeat 1st verse]
[Chorus]

He may win the battle but not win the war
We will not give him places to dwell
Soon armageddon will come like the thunder the prince will be blasted to hell!




",Prince of Darkness,1984
Omen,"Through all the pain and sorrow
You chose to stand alone
Out in the light like the desert
Sun you've shown
We all make the bet
We all try to forget
The pain that we have shared
But now you know:

Now, now you know
Now you know
The pain will grow

Only a fool would try what you have done
Stood eye to eye while under the gun
On and on you run for your life
All of your fears are they only in your mind

[Chorus]
Learn to stand learn to fight
You know the truth you've got the right
Learn to stand learn to fight
Speak the truth don't fear the night

You look away but still the truth it burns
Only a broken man he never ever learns
As all of your dreams slowly melt away
Once again there's nothing left to say

[Chorus]

Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night:

Through all the pain and sorrow
You chose to stand alone
Out in the light like the desert
Sun you've shown
We all make the bet
We all try to forget
The pain that we have shared
But now you know

[Chorus]

Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Don't fear the night
Learn to stand and fight
Don't fear the night




",Don't Fear the Night,1985
Omen,"Evil winds howl 'cross the frozen plain
Demons fury floods my mind again
Multitudes of homeless wander lost and scared
Into the burning lake of fire they are dared

Hell's gates open with a dream
Feel the fire lick your body clean
Hell waits the time is soon at hand
Hell's gates will open where you stand

Another shaded face among the crowd
Mindless voices screaming right out loud
Ghostly chanting ringing in my head
Shaping frightful visions of the totured and the dead

Hell's gates open with a dream
Feel the fire lick your body clean
Hell waits the time is soon at hand
Hell's gates, Hell's gates
Will open where you stand

Pages turn sinners burn
Judgment comes to all
Satan's rule for the fool
Who never ssaw the fall
Days will end God will send
His only son to slay
The demons seeds of hate and greed
Has eternal debts to pay

Hell's gates open with a dream
Feel the fire lick your body clean
Hell waits the time is soon at hand
Hell's gates are opening like he planned

Omen,"Merlin we need your magic
Against the evil one

Merlin we need your magic
For we are all alone

To become the force so strong

",Make Me Your King,1985
Omen,"It's love....
Do you really know the truth
We hear it from the mouths of youth
You must aim above the stars
To make it further than you are

[Chorus]
March on metal warrior
March to battle
To battle with all your might
March on metal warrior
You can't lose
You can't win without a fight

Prophets tell us of some fear
For the end is drawing near
We must learn to stand up tall
Or there's nothing left at all

[Chorus]

A fight of ??
You can't' lose
Can't' win without a fight
A fight

You can't' lose
Can't' win without a fight

We tried our bast at being brave
Why not clear what's in your mind
And leave this broken world behind

",March On,1985
Omen,"[Dedicated to the people of Poland]

They try to lock you away
From the human race,
Strip you of your dignity

A curtain forged in iron
Everyone must face,
Still you dream of running free

[Chorus]
You're locked in a Red Horizon
Living fearful of the bear

All this time
You thought you had it made,
Freedom was right there in your hand
Now you're feeling
Your're just another slave,
Still your mind can't comprehand

You're locked in a Red Horizon
Living fearful of the bear
Locked in a Red Horizon
Pain and sorrow everywhere

Do you really know the truth
It's right there in your heart
Will you ever get away
The time is now to start

Looking from the Earth
Reaching for the sun
Trying hard to run
Do you feel alone
Thousands by your side
Still you've never known
There's a changing tide
From the Red Horizon

They try to lock you away
From the human race,
Strip you of your dignity

A curtain forged in iron
Everyone must face,
Still you dream of running free

You're locked in a Red Horizon
Living fearful of the bear
Locked in a Red Horizon
Pain and sorrow everywhere

Red Horizon let me go




",Red Horizon,1985

Watch their life's blood slowly fade away
Drain of every ounce of power
And lead every one of them astray

Ruby eyes of the serpent
Are beckoning
Ruby eyes
Bring a day of reckoning

The bowels of the Earth
Spit up the flame and fire
To burn away every foul and evil thing

No path will be left for
The heartless liar
Who will be left to claim
This land and to be king

Cut out the hearts of the children
Watch their life's blood slowly fade away
Drain of every ounce of power
And lead every one of them astray

Stand up tall
Through the veil
You shall fall

Above the world in the dark of night
Another secret brought to light
Power gained and power lost
Man will win at any cost

Warning of Danger
We're ready for a fight
Watch for the stranger
A shadow in the night
Clip their wings and watch them fall
Know one ever heeds yours call

Through the veil, the final birth
Tribal warriors stalk the earth

Children suffer for the right
To wear the golden crown so bright
Power gained and power lost
Man will win at any cost

Now on your knees you beg release
Shake the earth without a tear
All are running lost with fear

The smell of death lingers in the air
Bloodstained bodies scattered everywhere
In the distance thunder in the sky
See the sorrow, hear the battle cry, battle cry

On the battlefield the tragedy of dawn
Through the crimson tide we still carry on

Omen,"All through the night steel by your side
Journey into the darkness beyond southern lights

Nowhere to run the nightmare is real
There's no way escaping the wrath the wrath of my steel

Omen,"Do you see clearly
The image on the wall?
Is true that man
Must surely fall

If we build foundations
Reflections in our eyes
Unless, we look deep within
It's believing only lies

Shadows cast in likeness
Stretching with the sun
Like the fear of death
They linger even though we run

Once before we lived in
Another space and time
Now that the earth is our home
We need a reason for the rhyme

Don't separate yourself
From your dreams

Do what you must to survive
Don't give up and don't give in
You must keep your dream alive
Do what you must to survive

The consequence is clear
Regret will break your heart
If you stop reaching for
The top, you'll be torn apart

Nothing worthwhile is easy
The path isn't always clear
With each forward step
We take, we bring the meaning ever near

Fear plagues each moment
Conviction will decide
If energy is gained or lost
Nothing more can it provide

Against the odds we struggle
Each in his own way
But you are the one
That faces reflections of every day

We, same as the legend
The prophesy will be fulfilled in the end

Our battle has come
And I fear to run
But with my blade of steel
The serpent is done

From his teeth on the ground
With an evil sound
Grow skeletons of death
Wanting my soul",Teeth of the Hydra,1996
Omen,"Through the mist of not so distant future years 
Comes a killer with a frame of steel 
Though he may look like any other man 
Something about him just isn't real 

With the strength of one hundred mortal men 
He stalks the city streets for you 
With eyes that focus like a zoom in camera lens 
There's nothing you can do 

[Chorus]
Cyborg lust 
Program - to terminate 
Cyborg lust 
Come to seal your fate 

Man's technology caused this bloody war to wage 
Computers try to take control 
Laser blasts fill the smoky skies with rage 
Mechanical beings fight with soul 

The death machine is sent back in time to kill 
The one who will teach us all to fight 
Onto this Earth a young woman's blood must spill 
To complete the program he will kill on sight 

[Chorus]

Cyborg lust

Omer Simeon,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1994
Omer Simeon,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin

Since my dad died, attitude worsened
That's why I stole cars before I could write cursive
Thousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind

Try to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton

One shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes
Only a dick head wouldn't want to be rich

And do his car like school and drop out in the 6

Pressed to the limit

From the start I was finished

Disowned by the biologicals
And adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird
Banging needles and pushing stolen Regals
And with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy

Stuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile
Just made me want to holla ""Lord help me""
But I had will power
Stole a burner from Uncle Lester

And that .22 long blossomed to wild flower
Now when I enter rooms the conversation stop
And them cock suckers whisper
These faggots ain't got no cahunas

So if they so much as touch me
I cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers

Yo I was brought up in the wildest streets
Where niggas pack everyday, and everybody crowd to eat
24/7, no time to sleep
A g and up, reign up, 3 times a week

Throwing numbers on the strip
The youngin' out the clique
Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip
Uh, Still in school, all the learning I can get

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit
These niggas tell, then a murder gon exist
It's no joke in the hood

Especially when the boat ain't make it across
And we ain't got no coke in the hood

It's just like credit the minute ya fuck up you ruined it ya know

Yo as young adolescents (aha) mommy said we was so precious
I mean who knew round to O.D to Heron and I'd catch cases
Let my life slip inside the hands of these judges
Where did we go wrong ha?
Was it these missing father figures?
Or watching mom struggle and feed us
Come on I need answers
It's gak on the judges for turning burners on niggas who try to merk us
On the day of judgement who knows
Until then we'll never know so for now I'm a do Omilio
Drunk then a muthafucka disrespecting bitches

My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

You see lady's prostituting wearing tight leopard
My sneaks was dogs like Pit bulls and German shepherds
Fuck where it came from I needed money fast
White boys bangin' Led Zeppelin went in twenty bags
So I got my first pack on fifty first and Market
I ain't want clothes I just wanted some boss to mark it
No moms to call no dad to be
Stuck on the streets stomach growlin' like a dog showin' his teeth
Life ain't sweet life ain't a game
I know life is more real then Slick Rick chain
Everybody get a hand so play the hand you dealt
And there's nobody to blame fuck it blame yourself
You can go all out and try to reveal
Like a nuclear staying how you write in a cell
You just better pray a liar and hope you prevail
I know living in the hood is hell, come on

My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

Yo right now I'd like to take the time to thank my family members
And phoney homies for turning they backs on me
Make me stronger help me deal with snakes and side guys
Going but I was grooming like a rodent
And I swear these streets will turn us boys to men
I'm the pain with juice and gin try to stack them Horace Grants to a million
Playing Caesar how I blessed them bitches
Excuse my arrogance but baby clone me
This petty world a kill me slowly take away my grandma mami hold me
Life obstacles is getting stressful that's why I don't come around
Written between the paper line examples of my lifestyle
So read inside the guidelines ain't no sunshine
Until you break the chains and fly freely 'cause I know for a fact
Somewhere out in the world somebody need me
To make em smile and appreciate em believe me
But main'tain in the main while baby
Omilio'll be there for you knahmean shit I'm a trouble man

Freeweezy here to break it down to ya

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Tryna to survive in the hood everyday
Takes, everything you work with
Everything you got quick
From the cops wyle off the product

Show em what helped a lot but I can't get it
I hugged the block, light an L
Let my man hit it and ran with it
Sell it nixed to the pops

Hate to tell ya if he don't get it from me
Then he gon get it somewhere else
Sometimes I would if I was somewhere else
Me and my man on the corner with two crates

Picture us rollin, somewhere else
Pretendin to be pushin the V's
Then two fiends walked up to me
Brought me back to reality

He want three and he want five
But my packed stash (why) 'cause the cops act like I'm Lil' Cease
Crush on me, keep rollin by
Tryna to put the cuffs on my black ass literally

No rules, no trees just a lot in the push
My [unknown] in the house, read my mouth
Fuck the D's got a pocket to push

Quarter to one guess I stop at the ?
Gimme a grub, count up the profit I made
Rule number one
Sell your first stack and cop you a gun

We hear gun shots, we hardly amazed
My man Willie Mays and Santana live on the run
What does it mean? not goin' back
Not gettin' caged, strong with a gat

Prepare for the raid
Listen Mothers, bodies still underaged
You better talk to your sons
Send em on a straight line from the lines

And move straight to the pen
Sleep with a blade, husky niggaz touchin they chin
Get bailed, get out and then they at it again
All for the love of the pay

Every since I don't stop waist side
Sparks had the ambition to ride
O. Town play games but I need this chain
Got me deep in the game

To the point, yea coulnd't get no rest, no sleep
All I did was hug the block
And shake the police while they shakin the bag
At age 18, like half a brick, crack got half the street

Most of my always call me ""Snoop""
'Cause I couldn't cook this shit then
So I brought all my worst stylin fiends
Runnin' back to the kid like ""Sparks man, you sold me some bullshit""

But I kept on pumpin' cause the block kept on jumpin
I'm not stoppin', I was told the sky's the limit
Plus I'm tryna to push the roads
And park the [unknown]

And let you know what exactly takes places in the ghetto
When techs blow
When the cops circle, I know the bells like ?
Run fast with that .38 special

Omillio Sparks, the young gun
My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then 
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except 
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise 
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?
Omillio Sparks, niggas, holla back

I'm back to the block with it
Wait, let me clear that up
I'm back to the blocks that you get when your block get it
Get hard with that hot water when the pot hit it
Get large with a little water when you pop wit' it
I send hope to late scramblers
Sling coke to you late you scramblers
Go broke, sling soap to you late night scramblers
No joke, I'm a crook; catch hooks broke; late night gamblers
Look, you loose limbs when fuck with him
That be I strapped and high
FBI all on back, want to trap the guy
Got niggas in all black want to snatch my pies
Never that, too many gats
Too many guns
Too many vests
Tough guys, not too many left
Where they at?
Dead or locked behind bars in jail
I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell
Dog, I been through it, son
Look at my scars and tell
Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it
You know passenger twisting backwoods
Slightly spinning
Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid
Like, you got like a minute
To put the cash in this bag or ya ass just might be in it
In small piece, I'll snatch your family up
Start from tall nephews to your small nieces
Bitches

Panic, the earth is heaving up beneath me. I've got nothing to say to besides it's over. Fire breaks through the window pane, it's coming. The guilt weighs down on me, heavy. This is the last moment that I'll ever feel. Then finally I find the thing that keeps me safe. Here comes the rain. To douse the flame, to wash away all my mistakes. Ruins stand stark against the sky and smolder. The air is heavy and it smells of sulfur. Sirens warn of the coming fear, take cover. Here comes the second wave for me. Triggered, by my failures. Carried, in the flames. Our part, is ending, trust me, I'm not afraid. Black smoke, on the horizon, the sky is burning, but where are you, I won't die alone. I won't die.

Are you all dead? Dead and walking, corpses talking. Is your blood red and beating? Still screaming ""don't let them take me""

Realize, that there's still a
Chance to change, to live, and never fade away. I wake...
Don't wait. The dead will take you in.

Apology. This fallacy. A welcomed haunting silence ringing through
The city. Sorrow floods the streets.

How can you lose, with the stuff you use?

See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light a-shining through the window
Lets me know everything's alright

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

See the paper lying on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the door step
Through the screen and across the floor

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard days work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world

See the smile a-waiting in the kitchen
Food cooking and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Breaking up all these plots and schemes

If the day when a man drives
Is what drives a man and for it the man dies
For the things he believes in,
If so when he dies it'll assume the he's leaving
Believe me I'm keeping you satisfied
Put the drama aside and just ride,
We could do the darkest weather
Get rich, stacking the cheddar who would keep the blunt licked,
Give me respect and I bet we'll be happy together

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well we're doin' mighty fine I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believen' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believen' that we all were on their side

Well there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changin' everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

You don't realize it's hard to tell between the truth and lies

So now I know exactly how you get down
So now I'ma go 'cause I don't need this ish now
I'm on the phone, I'm talkin' to this chick now
She gonna pick me up at your house

They say the truth hurts but lies hurt more in the long run
Thinking that you're fooling somebody, baby, you are one
The moment you been gone but I gotta forget you
I'm just trying to feel something real

So now I'm steppin' away
Like a window I can see right through ya
We all make our share of mistakes
All I ever wanted was the truth

So now I'm steppin' away
I can only give so many chances to ya
We all make our share of mistakes
All I ever wanted was the truth

Remember when you told me we was gon' get by
We had it on lock, you looked me in the eye
6 months later I'm wondering why I'm still listening to lies
I hadn't the faintest idea but I sat right there

Gave you the benefit of the doubt, to hear what you saying
'Cause we all human beings but it seems you still schemin'
Just lyin' in life, livin' a lie that you believing
You was tweakin' but you had me convinced

And now I'm convinced you need counseling and maybe some medicine
I need to step, cut ties, I know how you get
You living a double life I can't be involved with
Never no more, what I look like fallin' for that again

Worried sick of about ya till I'm sick of being 'round yo ass
I just hope you get it together
'Cause right now this is the hardest thing
For me ever

So now I'm steppin' away
Like a window I can see right through ya
We all make our share of mistakes
All I ever wanted was the truth

So now I'm steppin' away
I can only give so many chances to ya
We all make our share of mistakes
All I ever wanted was the truth

Don't follow me this time
Singing the same little sad song
I'm shutting it down, so that don't happen again
Too many tries, gotta move on

And if we meet down the line
Singing the same little sad song
We gotta get by so I'm walking away till then
I'm saying good bye, gotta get by

So now I'm steppin' away
Like a window I can see right through ya
We all make our share of mistakes
All I ever wanted was the truth

So now I'm steppin' away
I can only give so many chances to ya
We all make our share of mistakes
All I ever wanted was the truth
(All I really wanted, that's all I need)

All I ever wanted was the truth
(That's all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted was the truth
(That's all I ever wanted)

All I ever wanted was the truth

All I ever wanted was the truth
All I really wanted, that's all I really wanted

Because I've learnt
I can be your umbrella

I'll chill at the door

Straight and narrow before the arrow got us but
Honestly
Reciprocate my honesty
Stipulate what you want from me
Probably never be together

I think it's on for me

You need to move on from me

Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl

For me to explain my first line to ya
It's best to take you back to the scene of my first time
I was on Edith Street with a freak named Maddy
And a three liter cask of wine
Flowers in bloom, in her friend's sister's room
What's better than a girl who says 'yes' too soon?
Two of them
So I guess there lies the root of my problem
I float like the weather I never commit
But I ain't cheat on every girl I've ever been with
No I got your attention, riddle me this
Put your man up in a cab then sent me a kiss
Got your car nearby said where to you live?
Could go to yours, go to mine, wherever, you pick
Arrowheads through the bed man he never miss
Told her my room's a mess, said 'I bet it is'

I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl

She wanna mess 'round
But she don't want to get let down
Stretched out on my bed, be my guest now
Tell me, would you love me less now
You're well aware how I get down?
Whether pulling at your chair when we step out
Or pulling on your hair like you're stressed out
Shit, we've been everywhere so where now?
From here out, this we should be clear about, here me out
I used to keep an eye out like writters in the alley
But baby en pointe like the ballet, I feel like love
About to give her the keys a valet
And quit riding around like a Mustang Sally, but
Before we go too far
Girl you got to know I'm no shooting star
Mascara tears running down my path
I'll try to treat you right but you know what it's like

I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest
Wanna get caught up in my mess
Well, be my guest, be my guest, girl

Now I was at the merch desk, tryna mind my own
Left my girl for another long night alone
Holed in a hotel, miles from home
My t-shirt soaked through with sweat
I just rocked a set, and if you'd like to know
Right now I'm feeling flatter than the battery inside my phone
When Miss Fly walks by with the flattery
Tryna challenge me to go head-to-head, toe-to-toe
Making eyes, touching hands and flirting
Baby girl, tryna put some work in
But I know one thing for certain
I want you, but I don't want to be that person
So, listen, vixen, I'm fixing to making a mistake
If I don't vacate up out of this place
Stranger than fiction, now she waits in the distance
It can all change in an instant

It's something that you do, to me
Got me howling at the moon
How you do, so come on in
Before you make yourself at home
You should know a couple of things, where to begin

I cheat on every woman I've ever been with
Do you love me less?
I know this truth is stranger than fiction, girl
I must confess
I loved every woman I've ever been with with
But you knew the rest

'Cause we are the same
You saved me,
When you leave it’s gone again,

And when I see you on the street,
In his arms, I get weak,
My body fails, I’m on my knees,
Prayin’,

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won’t feel right,
'Cause I can't love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don’t feel right,
'Cause I can't love you more than this,
Can love you more than, this

I’ve never had the words to say,
But now I’m askin’ you to stay
For a little while inside my arms,
And as you close your eyes tonight,
I pray that you will see the light,
That’s shining from the stars above,

(And I say)
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just won’t feel right,
'Cause I can’t love you more than this,
'Cause I can’t love you more than this

When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just don’t feel right,
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,

When he opens his arms and hold you close tonight,

'Cause I can love you more than this,

Can't love you more than this",More Than This,2011

Dizzy’s all it makes us
We know where it takes us
We've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blaming each other

When we’re falling behind
Gotta make up our minds
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes

Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer
Stronger than we were before, yeah

When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay

Don't look back

We’re only learning then
How to make all the same, same mistakes again

The light shines
It's getting hot on my shoulder
I don't mind,
This time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends,
They look good and you look better

Don't you know all night I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, 'round, 'round?

Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
I waited for a girl like you

I'm weaker
My worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on head, don't you fail me now?
I start to say,
""I think I love you"", but I make no sound

Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
