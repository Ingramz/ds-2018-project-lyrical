Samhain,"Your life caves in, and I am there
Pulling you back from the shoulders down
And though you suffer you will be mine
I always win I am misery

Oh

I make your pain and suffering infernal
Turn your body inside out
Put you past your breath and tears
When all your loss is misery

Oh

I give you a glimpse of hope in the darkness
Let you think that this will end
And then securely nestle on your neck
And drag you back to misery

(Oh) I love this place
(Oh) I love this fuckin' job
(Oh) I love this place
(Oh) I love to give you pain

I give you a glimpse of hope in the darkness
I'll let you think that this will end
And then securely nestle on your neck
I drag you back to misery

(Oh) I love this place
(Oh) I love this fuckin' job
(Oh) I love this place
(Oh) I love to give you pain",I Am Misery,2000
Samhain,"Hot night
Break-neck
Oozing into that thing
It seethes 
It foams
It splits the death of love whole

All the things you hold most dear
Gone
And the world it dies
In my grip
All the world and everything
In my grip

Hold tight
It comes
Entry level, smooth and quick
To claim its wants
It need only put out its hand

All the things you hold most dear
Gone
And the world it dies
In my grip
All the world and everything
In my grip
And the world it dies
In my grip
All the world and everything
In my grip

Your mate
Your life
Everything you are and could be
It owns
It covets
It splits the death of hope whole

All the things you hold most dear
Gone

Samhain,"I live
Infinitus sleep has ended
And I live again

Beyond race
Beyond religion
Beyond man's fears

I am the end

Now is release
Now comes revenge
Now is the pain

You think you've known pain
You've known nothing

Feel its pulsing surge

My gift
Welcome it

Samhain,"The shift starts, your spine stiffens
You break out in a cold, cold sweat
Then the muscular convulsions tear at your brain
Leaving you snarling and snapping at air

Your thoughts are of tearing asunder
All that exists in a man's world
Control does not exist
You're in the shift and Hell has begun

Held in the shift (held in the shift)
Held in the shift (held in the shift)
(Kick, snare)

The shift starts, the growl comes from the stomach up
Back from the base of the vertebrae
Razorback, hair straight up
Fluid shoots from your mouth and lungs

Razorneck, or a carnal-dog-thing
Carnal in fury, carnal in lust
You burn from the power, it tremors the senses
Keen and cool and ready for blood

Back up, from the stomach up
Back from the base of a vertebrae
Razorback, hair straight up
Carnal in fury, carnal in lust

Held in the shift (held in the shift)

Samhain,"To walk the night
To feel no love
To know the touch of another kiss
Never more

To walk the night
To forever roam
To escape inside cool darkness
Alone

I have wandered my whole life long
The night becomes my bride and everything else must die
World without end
For me

Unearthly night
World you fear
Love lies lurking, a wounded dingo-dog 
Soon to decease

Sami,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2006
Sami,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Sami Kaneda,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1999
Sami Kaneda,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1999
Sami Swol,"Danke schoen, darling, Danke schoen,
Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony was the place we'd meet,
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park in fall how you tore you dress,
What a mess, I confess that's not all.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined for all time.
Yours and mine, that was fine.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for seeing me again.
Tho' we go on our sep'rate ways
Still the mem'ry stays for always.",Danke Schön,1999
Sami Swol,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Waqas : 
What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 

..(chorus).. 

You used to inspire others with your way of thinking and speech 
People came from afar just to hear us teach 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
Mosques are empty, refrigerators are stocked 
We lost our deen, we feel secure because our mansions are locked 
In my teen years salat really wasnt that tight 
Now i gotta pray each one of them twice. 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
Brother we prefer light skinned women 
while righteously maintain our deen against raicism (and tribalism)? 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
can you

Isam: 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell

I?ll pay the bank interest on a car I cant afford to buy 


What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
We used to smile at each other with faces full of light 
Now we frown on each other, we bicker, and we fight 
Pops in the mosque praying, 
kids in the streets haitin 
kids on the corner selling pot and in the mosque preaching? 


What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
The Quran has left our hearts - stranded hanging on our walls 
6,232 verses so strong 
9 out of 10 of us cant even read it or write 
1924 seems distand like way before Christ

que le paso a la masa como puede ser

he bisto como mi figura cahe en tentation 
al pesar que la vida ha esido buena con luce e ilusion 
he bebido! perdon por mis pecados 
tengo la cruce sobre mi cama 
e il diablo a mi lado 
que le paso a la masa como puede ser 
la bellesa conosida no la puedo ber 
e sentido incompetentia buscando la verdad 
todos disen conoserla solo beo la maldad 
que le paso a la masa como puede ser

(( 
what happened to the uma how can that be? 
the greatness known once i can?t see it no more 
i have seen my eyes falling in temptation 
although life has given me light and ilussions 
i have drinked!forgiveness for my sins 
i have the cross on the wall over my bed 
and the devil at my side 
what happened to the uma how can that be? 
the beauty i known i can?t see it no more 
i have felt the incompetence in my way to truth 
everybody pretends to know it, but all i see is evil 
what happened to the uma how can that be?

If I was to fall on my knees and ask you to forgive everything and anyone out of love for the one? oh oh oh

lets just break out of the darkness of ignorance.

Samiam,"She's always restless, just over medicated
Any kind of emotion, feels out of place
Never give your opinion, they've got all the answers
Follow the leader, and remember where you've been

Don't leave, it's not me you know
I can't control, what goes through my mind
So stay, please understand
I don't mean all I've said tonight

Haven't slept for days, and my words don't seem to come out right
It's just a phase that you're going to grow out of when you die
It's alright, you know everything is going to be just fine
Is it too much to ask for, some kind of ordinary life

Two weeks clean, a vague reality
From a lifetime clouded, lost details of your dreams
The will to eat, the pills you need to sleep
Things you never think of, until their always on your mind

Don't leave, it's not me you know
I can't control, what goes through my mind
So stay, please understand
I don't mean all I've said tonight

[Repeat x2]
Haven't slept for days, and my words don't seem to come out right
It's just a phase that you're going to grow out of when you die
It's alright, you know everything is going to be just fine
Is it too much to ask for, some kind of ordinary life",Ordinary Life,1998
Samiam,"How did you get this far, understanding nothing at all
You're nothing but small talk, is there anybody home
Is there a secret plan that you follow, do you do any thinking of your own
Make up your mind, flip a coin or something
Just say anything but I don't know
You do so much sneaking around, is it some kind of a stupid little game
Let's pretend that you're the master mind, and I'm your little blind dope

[Chorus]
Stay out of my sight, I'll put you out of my mind
Don't even want to know you anymore
Stay out of my sight, I'll put you out of my mind
Out of my mind
Don't even want to know you anymore
Stay out of my sight, I'll put you out of my mind

How did you get this far, understanding nothing at all
You're nothing but small talk, is there anybody home
Transparent, simple mind
Just hold your hands over my eyes
Unless you're trying to insult me
You'd better work harder on those lies

[Chorus]",Out of My Mind,1998
Samiam,"What the hell have you got to look forward to
I don't hear anybody knocking at your door
Your whole life has been a message in a bottle
Dumped in the ocean, never reaching any shore

At the point where nothing makes you happy
These days seem darker than they've ever been before
Here it comes again, that old familiar feeling
Get sick and leave your troubles on the floor

[Chorus]
(Just when I thought you were breaking down
Just when I thought you were breaking down
She found you
Just when I thought you were breaking down
Just when I thought you were breaking down)

You're shuttin' people out has become more like a reflex
They used to be your friends, but they don't know you anymore
Don't mean to hurt you, but it's my only self defense
I make myself a mystery, so they don't know who to look for

Look at yourself, have you noticed your complexion
Looks like you've been spending too much time indoors
In the mirror can you see your reflection
Or am I the only one who's noticed that you look bored

[Chorus]

I watched you fall apart
And never made a sound

What the hell have you got to look forward to
I don't hear anybody knocking at your door
Your whole life has been a message in a bottle
Dumped in the ocean, never reaching any shore

At the point where nothing makes you happy
These days seem darker than they've ever been before
Here it comes again, that old familiar feeling
Get sick and leave your troubles on the floor

[Chorus]",She Found You,1998
Samiam,"Get off the tracks, always the same things on your mind
Everything that you deserve, and how you've been denied it
You want it all so bad, no matter what you have
Can't be satisfied, with anything less than more

[Chorus]
Think you've made it, close your eyes, and open up your hands
While you were waiting, someone left footprints in your back
Your white leather couch is with that wallet full of cash
And gold plated egos shine up nicely with some class
Don't care how you get it, and you might regret it
As soon as things get brighter, you cram your head right up your ass

[Chorus: x2]
You want to be the one that does the telling what to do
So people like yourself will wish that they were you
You want it all so bad, no matter what you have
Can't be satisfied with anything less than more

[Chorus: x2]",While You Were Waiting,1998
Samiam,"Sitting in the corner I don't know what to think I can't 
Speak I sink a little deeper with every drink I try to sleep I shut my eyes 
And like a leaky faucet fear floods the room the one that drips away 
Patiently by day it was either lost or it was stolen but it's been missing 
For too long I woke up one morning and I couldn't see the sunrise I can't 
Recall the exact moment now but it began some time ago and it makes me wonder 
After all I've done what have I got to show I'm aggravated I'm what you 
Created now don't break me",Don't Break Me [Live],1999
Samiam,"Outside there's a box car waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the box car waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains
There is a wait so long
Here comes your man

Big shake on the box car moving
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

There is a wait so long
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man
There is a wait so long
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man",Here Comes Your Man,1999
Samiam,"Leaves his mind there at five. 
He knows his work's all done tonight. 
Doesn't care about love greed or hate: 
A beer and T.V. will disguise his fate. 
He moves his lips but nothing comes out. 
He clears his soul, but no one else could tell. 
Just one time he came along. 
Set aside all the things he knew. 
When all the peoples faces turned to gold, 
He found his thoughts and mind were sold.
He moves his lips, but nothing comes out. 
He clears his soul, but no one else could tell.",Television,2000
Samiam,"There's this bridge I've got to cross I feel alone.
A child down to each side and I can't carry both. 
The bridge is long we could fall down through holes, 
Water all around; wind, wet and cold. 
One child insecure displays the confidence he doesn't own, 
Another child, uncertain, looks around and cries for home. 
My bridge is too unstable and the insecurity is letting go. 
There's no holding to a crumbling bridge. 
When all the time is gone in between it tumbles. 
Time to move along
I toss and turn over and over, 
Trying to dream out anxiety, 
Easy answers to my problems. 
Keeping a grip on sanity 
Until the sun comes up 
And my mind's fresh and clean.",The Bridge,2000
Samiam,"I'd like to hide away somewhere without light 
Somewhere dark and warm no given chance to lose 
Without a care in my head I could sleep right through 
I gave it all away today those empty stares won't be from me 
There's not much to look forward to just as long as I can't remember 
Took a shower today couldn't feel the water hit my face 
Pinched the skin on my arm and I couldn't feel pain 
I guess my wish came true so now may I not lose",Clean,2000
Samiam,"is there a need for advertising 
me i might be a pigeon but i'm whole 
i've got this crazy notion i can get there for free 
this one's for sale everybody's criticizing 
but i don't get much advice i guess that's what i get for trying 
this one's for sale so what am i supposed to do this one's for you",For Sale,2000
Samiam,"You reel me in from a real long leash pulling me in just to tell me a speech I don't like the looks of that do you like the looks of that I gave it all I had you pull my head all over this town I get the feeling that I'm about to drown visions of you are just like me maybe that's the way you want me to be maybe we are too much alike or maybe not enough but some good times we've had



",Great,2000
Samiam,"Day dreams on the ceiling ridges in my memories 
Resting for the evening to warm to freeze 
Give me a reason why should I doubt something that comes so easy 
It's better than being down and out 
Free from the grind and breathing in it's so easy to drift away",Slumbering,2000
Samiam,"I wish I could be a part of your sadness. 
I wish I could cry for you. 
I hate to think of what you are going through
But, I've never known, 
I can't even sympathize. 
I can't even sympathize, I can't even sympathize
As I imitate your mood I feel so callous, so hard inside. 
Because my eyes are dry, 
I can't even sympathize. 
I just hope that it will be OK along the way.",Sympathy,2000
Samiam,"So now I know you have to say what's on your little mind 
And I always have to hear from someone else 
All your stupid lies come on now and look at me you'll see I'm okay 
It's story time now time for you to show your shallow existence 
It doesn't add up too much your junior insecurity 
Now I see that you're afraid of me",Tell Me a Story,2000
Samiam,"Seems like the further I get from here things come on time
Seems like the closer I get to home I'm way out of time 
I think about where to go it's always I don't know every time 
I think there is someone no one has shown where d'ya go 
I heard a voice in the dark and I knew it was you",Where'd Ya Go?,2000
Samiam,"You're got it all between your fingers.
What you want you just can't grab.
You want it, all
What you want you just can't have.
Sand sifts through, with my disgust.
And with my sympathy, chains lay in rust.
You want someone to hold you together.
But you're way too ""strong"", you?e way too proud.
You want someone to be around.
What you want, you need gone.
It's old, it's dirty, it's cold outside,
It's lonely, it's ugly, it's all around.",You Looking at Me,2000
Samiam,"The meeting convened at three a.m.
To satisfy the needs of the disenchanted friends
She left her charm bracelet by the bed
I kept it tough I don't know what it meant

Something to hold
Memories of my own
An absentminded offering (Oh, yeah)

I can't stand the sound of her voice
We'd never talk at all if I had my choice
She says things to me like she heard them on TV
I only hope no one is watching

I know once I get you home
I won't care anymore
I'll do anything not to be alone, not to be alone [2x]",Anything,2006
Samiam,"I drove past his house
You walked out the door
I wasn't surprised
I know you've been there before

I'm amazed
I still even care
I must have something left
I don't know where

I'm tired of being right
About how wrong i was
Thinking I could trust you
Just because I wanted to

Yeah I'm a believer
And I don't know why

You say you can't control
What makes you act that way
You also said never again
It must have sounded better then

Every time I'm burned
It hurts a little less
You don't want me to leave
But you want him more I guess",Believer,2006
Samiam,"Pull down the blinds
Don't think I'll make it out today
Spilling down from the sky
Another day one more than I can take

Get my irons from the fire
Cause mistakes are all I seem able to make these days
Later to bed, later to rise
Feeling unhealthy, unwealthy and unwise

I'm not screening calls
I just ain't answering the phone
Don't come banging on my door
Please just leave me alone

I don't know another way
I'm waiting for my luck to change
Without you by my side

This loneliness I feel
Is the kind I fear I'll keep
I'm trying to fall out of love
But I'm only falling asleep

I miss you so much
I might as well miss everyone
Ain't we having fun",Bide My Time,2006
Samiam,"I don't think I ever told you
When cords and wires were the same
I set fire to the field
Where you told me not to play
With a little girl named Amy
And we just ran away

I remember seeing a ladder
It reached up to the sky
Along the side of our building
I didn't realize
I'd climbed so high
You were there to bring me down

On radio corona
Singing with Charlie rich again
You hit every puddle
From here to San Rafael

You try to be happy
I like it when you call me pal
I know you want to protect me
Even when you don't know how

I wish you knew how much I miss you
When you don't come home from work
I try to be a decent person
I want you to be proud
Sometimes it's not so easy
When you're not around",Come Home,2006
Samiam,"I've tried to tell you how I'm feeling
But something's always lost along the way
From my heart to your mind it never comes out right
You don't want to hear it anyway

Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved

Always trying to make sure
You never get any more then you deserve
And you won't settle for less
Then less than second best
You're never disappointed that way

Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved

Who would someone who'd want someone like you
Who would someone who'd want someone like you
Who would someone who'd want someone like you
Who would someone who'd want someone like you

Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved

Who would someone who'd want someone like you
Who would someone who'd want someone like you
Who would someone who'd want someone like you",Do You Want to Be Loved,2006
Samiam,"Why would I ever consider
Letting myself get wrapped up again with you
I spent more than just my time
Begging you to stop the fucked up things you do
Before I gave up on you

But we'll get it right
We'll get it right
This time
We'll get it right
We'll get it right
We'll get it right
This time

You don't want me telling people
What went down before you got your head on straight
When they see you with me now
They look at you as if they know
Must have found out anyway

But we'll get it right
We'll get it right
This time
We'll get it right
Get it right
Get it right
This time

Think it's worth another try
Starting over don't seem possible to me
We'd only be continuing
Continuing with more of the same
Just more of the same

But we'll get it right
Get it right
Get it right
This time
We'll get it right
Get it right
Get it right
This time",Get It Right,2006
Samiam,"Wake me stop me from shaking
I never want to dream that dream again
I'm tired of the lullabies you sing me
I wish I could get them out of my head

See how far from home I've drifted
I don't revolve around you no more
You act like I've been drawn away by another distant star
But you know you cast me off yourself

We don't always keep our promises
I don't want to be tied down
Some dreams never make any sense
At least they don't make sense to me
They don't make sense right now

Did you think that I was faking
When I said I couldn't take it anymore
In the world you're making
There's no room for anyone but yourself",Lullaby,2006
Samiam,"Black clouds hang over you
Like anvils on a string
They follow you everywhere so
Don't stand so close to me

They gather while you're sleeping
And wait above your bed
And when you open up your eyes
They strap themselves fast to your head

Dreamed through another starless night
Awakened by the gloom this morning
I keep myself buttoned tight
These storms come without warning
There seems to be no end in sight
This shit could last forever
I've been through this before
There's no predicting weather you

Will find your way around
Whatever's got you down
Whatever's got you down

The lines across your brow
Tell me the entire story
I won't be listening
While you go on about your fears and worries

Dreamed through another starless night
Awakened by the gloom this morning
I keep myself buttoned tight
These storms come without warning
There seems to be no end in sight
This shit could last forever
I've been through this before
There's no predicting weather you

Will find your way around
Whatever's got you down
Whatever's got you down

You blow into the room
I pour myself some shelter
I know the storm is coming soon
I'm sensitive to changes in pressure

I spent another sleepless night
On your couch tossing and turning
Sometimes I don't know why I try
I think my neck is broken

There seems to be no end in sight
This shit could last forever
I've been through this before
There's no predicting weather you

Will find your way around
Whatever's got you down
Whatever's got you down
Can you find your way around
Whatever's got you down
You're bringing us all down",Storm Clouds,2006
Samiam,"I hope you got the help you needed
I'm so sorry for the way I treated you
Didn't know you were so defenseless
If you don't regain your senses someday soon

If you come down I hope you land safely
I know you think the world's fucking crazy but it's you
Maybe you went home to your family
If they exist never know how much of what you say is true

Who'll take care of you
Who'll take care of you
Who'll take care of you
When no one else will

Never thought you had a thing worth breaking
Don't know how I ever could have been so cruel
You needed to be protected
But once you make up your mind there's no persuading you

Who's gonna take care of you
Who's gonna take care of you
Who's gonna take care of you
When no one else will",Take Care,2006
Samian,"J’représente ma nation, ma culture, ma passion
Ma raison de vivre!
Mes origines, ma fierté, ma zone grise!
Faut pas oublier que j’viens de l’Abitibi
Sur une terre algonquine, on m’a appris la vie!
Avec mes joies et mes peines
ma rage, ma haine!
Tout ce qui a joué contre moi-même 
Devenu la cause de mes problèmes!
La crise d’oka a rien à voir avec mon cas
Mais j’vais me battre jusqu'au bout pour défendre nos droits!
J’veux suivre la voie de mes ancêtres
être la voix de mon peuple!
Une langue en voie d’extinction
J’veux rebâtir la Nation!
Car je représente ma Nation, bref, ma génération,
Mon peulple, mes ancêtres! Il y a pas mille façons d’être
Je suis ce que je suis , je suis fier de l’être
Et je suis le premier de ce monde à apprendre à me connaître!
Juger par nos paroles? J’ai pas choisi les paraboles!
J’aime mieux dire les vraies choses, ce qui fait de moi un porte-parole!!

Refrain :
On me dit que c’est la vie? C’est la vie!
Fuck that! L’injustice qui t’instruit
Mais dans l’fond ça te détruit!
On dirait que je peux encore entendre les hurlements
Et quand on me parle de mon histoire moi j’trouve ça dégoûtant!
Mais dire que c’était nos vies, une mémoire impardonnable!
La même vie sale que les enfants de Duplessis!
Estie! On a tous nos p’tits soucis 
Mais quand ça touche toute une Nation moi j’me sacrifie!

Quand j’vois que dans ma communauté ça tourne mal!
J’essaie de changer l’monde avec mes cordes vocales!
De les conscientiser, d’arrêter d’ignorer!
On fait partie de l’histoire mais l’histoire est loin d’être terminée!
Mettre dans des réserves ça veut dire mettre de côté
Mais mon opinion les derniers seront les premiers!
Je suis un millitant! J’ai beau me battre pour la cause
On n’en mérite pas tant! Regardes ailleurs c’est la même chose!
En Afrique! Les peuples blancs qui contrôlent!
Ils ont débarqué avec des Bibles, pis ils ont volé les terres!
Ils ont fait la même chose ici, penses-tu vraiment que j’vais m’taire?
Ceux qui pensent le contraire, ils s’mêlent pas de leurs affaires!
On est mis à part et l’gouvernement a fait sa part
Dur d’admettre ses torts, mais j’veux vous l’faire savoir!
C’est bon de savoir la vérité
Et en tant q’Amérindien j’trouve qu’on n’a pas mérité
D’être où est-ce qu’on est!!

Refrain :
On me dit que c’est la vie? C’est la vie!
Fuck that! L’injustice qui t’instruit
Mais dans l’fond ça te détruit!
On dirait que je peux encore entendre les hurlements
Et quand on me parle de mon histoire moi j’trouve ça dégoûtant!
Mais dire que c’était nos vies, une mémoire impardonnable!
La même vie sale que les enfants de Duplessis!
Estie! On a tous nos p’tits soucis 
Mais quand ça touche toute une Nation moi j’me sacrifie!

La Loi sur les indiens a obligé les pensionnats
Ma famille a passé là! Pis ils ont passé l’âge d’en parler!
Renfermée, sans clef, de l’interieure qu’ils ont créé!
Parce qu’il y a des violeurs d’enfants trop lâches pour s’excuser!
Ça fait qu’ils envoient de l’argent, de l’orde du gouvernement
Sans aucune excuses pour les viols et les attouchements!
Il y a de quoi de pas normal , c’est pour ça que j’en parle!
Et si ça te rend mal à l’aise, bien c’est à toi que j’parle!
Il y a certaines communautés affectées par la mortalité
Des jeunes en crise d’identité, c’est plus la même mentalité!
Mais la réalité, hiver comme été!
On a vécu le même calvaire mais pas dans l’même quartier!
Je suis plutôt réaliste, loin de l’imaginaire
Malgré ma souffrance je remets tout à la Mère-Terre!
Moi j’parle au nom du peuple, au nom de ma Nation
De ceux qui en on souffert, yo! Bienvenue dans mon monde!!",Injustice,2007
Samian,"Je me présente Samian, je débarque dans le hip hop
j'avance à grand pas pis j'ai pas les pieds dans la même botte
j'ai arrêté de vendre du pot pis d'la coke
aujourd'hui je rappe pour ma cause pis je t’en offre une dose
c'est mes tounes, mes histoires, mes problèmes
ma façon de voir la vie pis c'est une façon de voir la tienne
il y a des trucs sur l'album que j'ai jamais dit à personne
j'me dévoile...  sans faire de mal à personne
j’suis tellement simple, c'est tout ce que le rap me transmet
j’suis humble et vrai! c'est tout ce que le rap me permet
mais dans l'fond....   j'ai pas besoin de permissions
parce que je dis ce que je pense et je pense comme j'écris
je sais d'où je viens pis je sais où je vais!
c'est pas le cas de tout l'monde pis c'est pas tout l'monde qui pense comme ça!
je suis le gars que tu vois, pis je reste ce que je suis
si je suis debout devant toi c'est que le travail a porté fruit
yo! fuck l'attitude je suis le même gars que d'habitude
j'ai marché dans des chemins où l’asphalte était rude!
dans l'illégalité!!
t'es pas rappeur par style mais par mentalité!

faut arrêter de tourner en rond, pis de rester stable
j'ai essayé une couple de fois, estie que j'étais détestable
c'est dans ces temps là que je prend mon pack sac
toujours le même shit, jamais à même date!
mais bon, je fais avec!!
parce que t’as pas l'choix de vivre avec!
on a tous fait le con pis c'est l'temps de l'admettre!
pas d'études pas de travail!
j'ai décidé de faire du rap et c'est le rap qui me travaille
où est-ce que tu veux que j'aille, partout c'est pareil
attentif aux conseils, n'importe quel con s'essaye!
ce que j'aime... c'est la liberté d'expression 
sans même poser un geste on peut faire une action!
la vie peut être belle c'est ce qu’on appelle le paradis
c'est juste qu’on ne nous l’a pas dit!!
Une réalité de communauté, loin du millieu urbain
avec la même mentalité, c'est-à-dire le rêve Americain
l'argent mène le monde pis on se plaint le ventre plein
au salaire minimum, obligé de faire ça à temps plein!
d'autres sont mis à part, par un système qui roule sur l'or
et d'autres sont mis à mort par une justice qui dort
je viens d'une p'tite réserve au nord, il est temps que le vent tourne de bord
je rappe pour les miens jusqu’à ma mort! parce qu’on est mis à part!
aussi bien nous mettre la peine de mort! avec le même décor
mais fuck off on reste fort, il est temps que t'apprennes mon histoire!",Intro,2007
Samian,"Dans une ville appelée Kapak, lieu de débarquement, mes ancêtres ont fait leur pack sac pacifiquement,
Sur l’Anikana, en route au nord du Canada, (Canada, Canada, Canada)
Samian, Loco Locass, il était temps que l’union se fasse, qu’on remonte la vraie histoire pour qu’on puisse y faire face,
On veut mettre un pont entre les nations, confondre la culture, ignorer les préjugés, laisser parler la nature

La barrière entre les peuples, on veut plus la casser, on en a plus qu’assez, on est placés pour parler,
On remonte le temps dans le pantalon de Cristophe Colomb qui découvre l’Amérique et tous ces peuples qui y habitent
On était pacifiques et encore, même aujourd’hui, un homme blanc sur l’Atlantique qui rêvait de faire son pays,
On fume le calumet de paix, sans rancune, on est capables de rester vrais même si on porte plus de plumes

L’union de deux nations freine l’ignorance,
Pousse les connaissances avec un peu de reconnaissance
Mon histoire et la tienne, ça fait deux,
Je fais partie de deux peuples, donc je finirai comme l’un d’eux

Hochelaga, Stadaconé, on débarque en rabaska cette année, on a décidé de se métisser,
Parce qu’on a retissé l’alliance en Nouvelle-France, entre autochtones et francophones
Mamawintiwin mi iima eiji mackawisiak, mackawisiak, eawiakowiak, etitentakosiak,
C’est en mêlant le son qu’on scelle le pacte

De l’Europe à l’Amérique, j’ai traversé l’Atlantique à cette époque épique, au pays du porc-épic,
La maladie du scorbut scorait droit au but et c’est aux premières nations que je dois ma guérison
Raquette, canot, boucane, tisane et toboggan, l’authentique Autochtone enseigna au profane
La science de la savane, sans se douter qu’en filigrane, la soutane mégalomane allait lui casser le crâne

Pour les Amérindindiens, en Amérique, il y a deux choix : soit on les abat comme aux États,
Ou bien soit on les réserve comme au Canada, mais réserve ou abat, le problème demeure le même

Samir Fejzic,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You were holding hands and I will never be the same 

Now here you are begging to me 
To give a love another try

Hi baby. How was your day today? 
I love you honey, I want you babe. 
You missed me? Well, I missed you too, I missed you so much. Then I followed you today. 
What? You followed me? 
Yeah, that's right. I saw you with that girl.

Walking on the street, kissing her, holding her hand. And now you come back to me.

Standing there ,I know you
There were smile to me (smile to me)
Uuh my heart melt away

Your look was so precious
You gave this night so many specials
Cause when I talk with you 
Walk with you
A long expected dream came true

Baby I can?t get you
No no no I can?t get you 
Outta my mind
I can?t let you 
Walk away outta my life x 2


The time seemed to fly away
When you left
My whole life was changed
You were the cause and the source
Of this unexpected love

Chill ran down my spine 
When you smiled 
Came back to my mind
Your eyes and voice 
Cause the choice 
To get you back into my life

Baby I can?t get you
No no no I can?t get you

I can?t let you

I feel a longin? for your warm embrase
A tender breeze strokes my cheek
You kiss and touch felt quite like this

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey

Sammi Smith,"I wanna tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife,
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High,
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play,
And she said.""Mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA.""

Well the note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way.""
And it was signed by the secretary, ""Harper Valley PTA.""

Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the black board, I still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there, and seven tims he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor seems to use a lotta ice, whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades a pulled completely down

Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me, you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place, and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because, it really did happen just this way

Sammi Smith,"Baby, baby, fallin'' in love
I''m fallin'' in love again

I could never see 
What fate had meant for me
And then you came 
And made my dreams match reality
Maybe you can see 
All the things you''ve meant to me
And my simple fate is at the gate 
And, girl, you''ve got the key

It seems like yesterday 
You and I first loved this way
But now I know how love 
Can grow with each and every day
As we lay at midnight''s hour 
And feel love''s hidden power
So strong and bold 
As life unfolds its mystery to me

Mine just happen to be 
The ones that brought me 
Into this world 
So this song is dedicated to you 
Dear Mom 

Gave to me life  heard my cries 
Curiously looked in my eyes 
All those things you said to me 
I'd be a doctor  lawyer  scientist 
Conversations from the heart 
Funny how you tolerated me 
There are times when you stood for me 
But you're always there when I need 
The little things you do 
God has blessed me 
You're my hero, my hero lives in you 

You're my hero 
You don't need an S across your chest 
You're my hero 
You know you can move mountains by yourself 
But still you're my hero 
The strongest person that I found 
Can leap a building in a single bound 
But know you're my hero 

Lately after months been gone 
Spending time with you alone 
Basketball practice you went with me 
Football and those baseball games 
You wanted me to play 
But still you helped me be 
The singer that's in me ooh daddy 
There were time you stood for me 
But you're always there when I need 
The little things you do 
God has blessed me 
You are my hero, you are my hero 
My hero, my hero lives in you daddy 

You're my hero 
You don't need an S across your chest 
You're my hero 
You know you can move mountains by yourself 
But still you're my hero 
The strongest person that I found 
Can leap a building in a single bound 
But know you're my hero 

You're my hero 
You don't need an S across your chest 
You're my hero 
You know you can move mountains by yourself 
But still you're my hero 
The strongest person that I found 
Can leap a building in a single bound 
But know you're my hero 

There were times when I would sit down 
And talk to you 
Yes there were times oh yeah 
Sometimes I miss those days",Hero,2000

Strike one, got you by surprise
Strike two, right before your eyes
Pitch three, this ones to the wall
Ain't no game like a game of Hardball

When I step to the plate the outfielders get back (back)
Cuz they know I'm the only tight for dogs
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammie Sosa
Bubble gum, balled up all the hustlers
Y'all know how to work it when it's time to compete
On the field, on the court, over any hot beat
And break, and you know it when you see your clone
And right now that's all I see goin' on, holla at me
Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home
'Cause I don't lose to much
Matter fact, I ain't never list at all
When I'm playin' Hardball (that's right)
So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me
Understand I'm like Griffin, I keep 'em to the wall

This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin' the pop
Keep pithcin' 'em, I'm in the kitchen makin' radio rock
It's usually preferred, I be choosey with all my words
Throwin' eggs at them chicken heads, bangin' on the curb
I left 'em a word, I'm fast ballen' with a curb
Happy slidin' home, tellin' them friends that's in the third
Sure ya done heard, who I'm doing and what I'm doin' was false
And what's true, girl listen
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGregor
That other kid was just a mark, so I made him retire
See, we all got a base, and we hold our own
But when I come up to bat, we all goin come home
And our fans cheers us, 'cause they know what the drill goin'
Out of the field and into your automobile
And I hope it ain't your Range Rover, that you spent your change over
I'm in the dug with my tounge out play the game over

You know I'm gettin' you hot, hot as the Kendrick, ya know
And I keep the crown bat swingin', swingin' that at iron
Pitch on the block like monaural
To bad for TV, you won't see me I'm ridin' the streets
I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets
Watch the game, get you life in the streets
My watch, my chain, and my teeth Cost
That way I will never cheap talk
And I call my mommy sweat heart, she call me sweet daddy
And she gladly, loves the way that daddy batty, yeah baby
Whezzy Wee is a playa baby, and I don't share babies
So if you searchin' for some bitch ain't nothin' here, baby
Catch me throwin' an eighty in the latest Bentley
Goin' out, and Whezzy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy
Does hip-hop flyies are knockin' up, out the park

Eating candy solving the world
Tryna play it out, bright lights, butterflies

It's been a minute since we broke up
Can we pick up where we left off?

And I ain't playing 
You're like an angel with wings 
Watch you float away
(Please just let me hold you)
Like the first day of April 
The start of spring 
The flowers The sun
The joy you bring
You're the music to my hears
You're like a symphony
Feels so good to know you

Something bout 
Something bout your chestnut eyes girl
Something bout
Something bout your caramel thighs
Something bout 
Something bout the way you lick your lips
Something bout 
And I love how you're working them hips girl
Something bout 
I love it how you're rocking them jeans girl
Something bout 
You're tasteful like my favorite ice cream
Something bout 
Your flavor is driving me wild 
Something bout 
I want to play in clouds

How does it feel up there
Come down and let me love you
Would you take me there
Ohh you look so heavenly
I can't help but stare (and I)
Want to share everything with you
Baby I swear ohh you look so heavenly

On a scale from one to ten 
Girl you are off the Richter
If I had to describe you
You're a perfect picture
And I heard you're on the market 
So I got to get you
Girl I adore you
And I know that it sounds like
Game I'm spitting
And I swear it's from the heart
And none of this is written
Girl let me complete your puzzle
Cause I'm what you're missing
I just want to love you girl 

Something bout 
Something bout your chestnut eyes girl
Something bout
Something bout your caramel thighs
Something bout 
Something bout the way you lick your lips ha

And I love it when you're working them hips girl

I put a lot of honesty and trust into you

I try to be without but it drives me crazy
There's only one thing to do

Let it ride
I gotta let it ride, let it ride
That's the only thing that I can do

Maybe I jumped in too fast
Should've took my time
But I was so excited that you wanted to be mine
Girl I was straight with you
I didn't play no games stayed true
Even when my boys said that I was a fool

Oh Oh Oh Woo!

Wooo-ooh. woo-ohh Woo-ooh woo-oh.
Woo-ooh woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh.
Yeah, Ooooh no. Its time I spread my wings and fly, babe. 

(Another be-cox Joint)

[Verse 1:]
Dear mama, this goes out to you 
I know its hard for you to accept what it is I do
But its you who said son follow your dreams.
Sky's the limit, the music isn't all its cracked up to be.
And I know that its hard to let go
(yeah)
But its time that I shine and I know,
That its this music that influenced me to keep on going fluently,
You don't know what it do to me.
I love you mama watch your boy shine. 

[Chorus:]
Were at the crossroads, took me as far as as you can go.
Now its time for me to grow up and be a man so.
(now) Imma spread my wings and fly this don't mean that its goodbye.
But I gotta find, gotta find my own
Way now (please understand) gotta find my own way now (im finally a man)
Gotta find my own way now (i know its hurting you so)
Gotta find my own way now (you gotta learn to let me go) gotta find my own way

[Verse 2:]
And I pray dear God, please let there come a day I can support my family and everything will be okay
Here I pray dear God,
Let me get up out this hood so brother and sister can live good and everything will be okay.
And I know that its hard to let go (yeah) 
But its time that I shine and I know, that its this music that influenced me to keep on going fluently,
You don't know what it do to me.
I love you mama watch your boy shine. 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Everything I do I owe it all to you.
Without your love and care what would I do
Can't imagine my life without you
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama [x2]

It's the simplest things

The way you walk, the way you talk

But your girls got my eye
I think you should know that

Baby, you're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in
Girl I know you don't hear this often

Shorty, you're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in through the door
She's what I'm looking for

Baby, look on the bright side
Though you won't be with me
You can still go with the team
Girl, as long as your friend is coming

I won't rush that I know, I gotta know
What's up with this hook up girl
Her beauty's a crime
And she needs to be handcuffed, ohh

I've been feeling this feeling
For too long and I can't go on
Unless she give me her digits
For that call and we finally talk

Ooh, she's sexy
And I'd be completely satisfied
If she would only touch me
When she's ready to leave, ooh girl

Push the clutch and finally broke the damn ice
Would have done it sooner had I knew you were intrigued by me
Had no idea kept making these excuses

I say life's what you make it
Whether you working nights or day shift
Extra money on the side as a waitress
While you go to school, tryna keep your grades straight
You a dropout
Never fit in with the crowd, getting cropped out
In every picture that your crew and cool friends post on Facebook
A Twitter or whatever they on
And it's no wonder why you feel alone
Parents moved so much you never had a home
Just tune out the world, you can turn me on
No, I'm just here for you for a couple songs
No, I'm just here for you for a couple songs
So tell me what your pain is
Being you what defined you as a great kid
It's the easy way out so go get wasted
But if you get a chance to change don't waste it

Every day
That you wanna change
And break away
And break away
Every day ay ay
That you get faded
While they get famous
It's also takin it

Don't let it go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Don't let it go to waste

You gon wake up on the right side
Instead of lookin back you lookin for the bright side
Oh you got a good look from a bad chick
And some other shit that you didn't expect to happen
See the point of the story kid is to dream big
You never know what's gonna be there when the saints wakes
Could be you on a soldout stage
Just the fans that raise anything you say
I'm talkin to everybody in the world
Who's ever been scared of reach
Who's ever been scared of girls
Who's ever been scared of boys
I'm talkin to all of yall
Telling you stay true, I'm telling you stand tall
'Cause all it takes is one move to be on your way
Whether you're tall, fat, skinny, pretty, straight or gay
Seems easy to say fuck it and get wasted
But if you get a chance to change don't waste it

Every day
That you wanna change
And break away
And break away
Every day ay ay
That you get faded
While they get famous
It's also takin it

Don't let it go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Go to waste
Don't let it go to waste

You got caught off a good thing
Get a job, just becoming something routine
And you feel like the whole world hates
But it's something that your soul can't fix so
Take a deep breath, take a step back
Know you good as long as you can get past
All the pressure but it's close til you taste it
But if you get a chance to change don't waste it

Every day
That you wanna change
And break away
And break away
Every day ay ay
That you get faded
While they get famous
It's also takin it

Don't let it go to waste
Go to waste

Go to waste

I'm trying to live the life a kid always expected
Over on Sunset, finished a couple sessions
One foot in the door, one in the hills, questions
Angels in leather, I ain't talking 'bout the motor club
But I tend to go hella hard when I go to clubs
Minibar murder, I'm on Denzel's flight
With a stewardess that wants to fuck the whole damn night
Who cares what they all say
Try'na find some girls like Hov did with Beyonce
Had you for a week but I heard you say fiance
Na na, none of that girl

I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home

And she said, and she said uh

Everybody's a model or a wannabe
If you're that bad it's in Paris where you ought'a be
She's an actress, working on the late shift
Only longs for a big break as a waitress
Walk the strip, see the fashion getting wacky now
Out the door, passing out
Hit the floor, Pacquiao
Credit card at the bar never closing out
But the weather's so nice, nobody slowing down
Well except for the 101
Gotta SUV stuck in traffic with a ton of buds
I can promise you tonight's gon' be a ton of fun
Know that c-c-c-c

Henny straight, everyday summer
Never on the sheets like you're on top of the cover

Look at the cops, don't even care, you can just blow smoke
I'm Robin Hood on the beat

I watch an eagle rise above the trees
Project myself into what he sees

So take me away 
Come on fly me away 
Lift me up so high
Where eagles fly 

I often dreamed that I could sail through the sky
I've always wished I could fly

You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

Sammy Cahn,"There's a kind o' walk you walk
When the world's undone you,
There's a kind o' walk you walk
When you're walking proud

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When the neighbors shun you
There's a kind o' walk you walk
Sets you 'bove the crowd

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When somebody loves you
That's very much like walking on a cloud

Good fortune found you, chappie
And your lives are happy, Valentine
When you're walking happy
Don't the blooming world seem fine

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When you feel like crowing
There's a kind o' walk you walk
When you're on your way

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When your pride is showing
There's a kind o' walk you walk
Today's your day

There's a kind o' walk you walk
When the world's a rainbow
And you heart is popping like a popping jay

So you had best believe it, chappie
You're finding life is finger snappy
The day you learn that walking happy
Gives the world a shine

So just keep walkin' happy with your hand in mine
With your hand in mine, keep your hand in mine
Love your hand in mine

Sammy Cahn,"One day you turn around, and it's summer
Next day you turn around, and it's fall
And all the winters and the springs of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all

As a man, who as always had the wandering ways
I keep looking back to yesterdays
Til a long forgotten love appears

And I find, I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years

As I man, who has never pauses at wishing wells
Now I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears

And I find, that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years
The golden warm September of my years",September of My Years,1972
Sammy Cahn,"What good are words I say to you?
They can't convey to you what's in my heart
If you could hear
Instead
The things I've left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I
Know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear
Me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

 The moonlight on the lake
 The way we danced and hummed our favorite song

 The bell I (you) rang to prove that I was 
 (you were) strong

 The rented tandem bike
 The lunches that we used to pack

 The leaves began to fade 
 Like promises we made
 How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?

Sammy D,"Sometimes I wonder how I cope 
When every time I open my mouth 
You jump down my throat 
And some nights the beds so cold 
In frozen sheets 
It's like we're lying at opposite poles 
And I just don't know 
What to do 
Loosen my grip 
Or take a tighter hold on you 
Just remember 
That you came looking for me 
I didn't hunt in someone else's territory 
You presented the opportunity 
It was you who pursued me 
Maybe you just needed the change 
And got a kick out of playing the game 
I know you don't like things that stay the same 
So I guess you're not to blame 
I suppose its my fault again 

[Chorus]
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye 
But I don't ask too many questions why 
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye 
But I don't ask too many questions why 

Neither of us knew what to expect 
What was gonna happen next 
So we cherished every caress 
Sorry I wasn't there 
When you needed a rest 
A shoulder to cry on 
Moral support 
Honestly 
I always thought about you 
And I hated the fact 
We only had 
Brief moments of contact 
We'll survive and if we persevere 
Then maybe this will last for years 
I don't mean to exert pressure 
I just wanna give 
And receive pleasure 
And if you're pouring 
I'll have full measure 
'cause it's you I'll treasure 
Even if we're not together 

[Chorus]

Even though these questions still remain 
Time won't change a single thing 
We're still playing all these selfish games 
But I'd hate to hate you 
Why do all the questions stay the same 
Why do all you're answers cause me pain 
Do I need to say it all again 
I'd hate to hate you

And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,

Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back

Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

I've laughed and cried,

Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life

From jazz and cocktails

With distant gay traces

By too many through the day

With a siren song

Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
But, I was wrong

And only last week, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts will probably be a bore, a bore

It's best that we do
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Just remember
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

And if you ever saw it

Join in any reindeer games

Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee

Boy, how they could love!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;

She was totin' a forty-four gun!

Started yankin' the bell!

Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,

She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!

She was just as calm as any gal could be!

They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.
And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
Then they did know assuredly

Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.
Then entered in those wise men three,

Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

"Sammy Davis, Jr.","It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2013

From relatives you don't know

Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a yuletide hymn

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, oh, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well, in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town""

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Though your nose gets a chilling?
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

Sammy Hagar,"To fight for my freedom, I don't need a gun or a knife. 
I just need some open space to run for my life. 
The ground is sinking and the walls closing in. 
When I get to the bottom I get up and start all over again. 
Just passin' time until the big one. 
As we leave it all behind. 
And move on up to a brighter future 
It's no easy climb. 
But I'll never say die... 
I'll never say die... 
My mom and dad never understood. 
But compared to their problems, you know, mine looked good. 
They screamed, ""Where's the money?"" and ""Where's all the love?"" 
And ""Where's the help from the man up above?"" 
I never gave up my religion 
As I did my teenage time. 
I said, ""When I'm of age, I wanna walk out smilin' 
Maybe I'll cry... 
But I'll never say die..."" 
I'll never say die... Ohhh! 
Oooh never say die - I'll never say... 
Oooh never say die - No I will never, never, never say... 
Oooh never say die - Oh, I'll never say die... 
Oooh never say die... 
Two generations I've been through 
'69 was heavy, yea, but, what did it prove? 
Just a bunch of hippies could become businessmen 
And burn our bodies, a flag, and a couple of friends. 
Now as we enter 1980 
We're modern humans in a modern time. 
So all you children of the '60's 
It's no easy climb. 
But don't ever say die... 
Don't you ever say die... Oh! 
Oooh never say die 
Oooh never say die - Just stand there, baby! 
Oooh never say die - Oh, never say, never say die...

To feel you all around me
To take your hand and walk along the sand

I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I look your eyes I find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing
It would make me sing
Yeah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

I'm gonna catch that wind
Help me catch the wind all for you, babe
Just for you, baby

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fear
Help me to leave my blues behind
For standing inside your heart where I want to be

Somewhere, somebody must need me. 
Look in the mirror - I see a face 
Oh, man things get lonely. 
You showed me something I can't replace 
You came to me for a whole different space. 
My daddy warned me, momma did too, 
They said, ""Son, see what some lovin' can do"" 
I guess love has found me. 
I guess love, I guess love has found me. 
Just yesterday, I swore to myself 
I was gonna stay free and easy. 
Then my head turned around 
What I was missin' I found. 
From my own trap you freed me

My paycheck after taxes barely pays the rent 
I do the town on Friday, by Tuesday, it's all spent. 
Two bucks an hour, this job ain't too hip. 
My lovelife's turning sour working the night-shift. 
It's the pits! It's a one way trip on a sinking ship 
Ain't it the pits, but you just can't quit 
When the scale won't tip or the key don't fit. 
Two $6.50 tickets to hassle with the crowd 
I got hit with a Frizbee, the band played too loud. 
I got all their records, man, and loved all their hits, 
But this is the worst! It's the pits! 
Oh, you can't keep it lit then it sticks to your lip. 
Oh, ain't it the pits when the record skips and the TV quits. 
You're in deeper and deeper, you dig into the pit. 
The climb is always steep - you can't get a lift. 
Ain't it the pits! 
It's the bottom of the list 
It's all wing tips and double-knits. 
It's the pits.

Things were just gettin' heavy when the red light appears.

He put the 'cuffs on my wrist, read me my rights, oh things got intense. 
I got 90 days in jail, no one would go my bail, so there I sit.

When the waist-line slips, 39 inch hips and your pants don't fit. 
You're in deeper, you dig into the pit. 
The climb is always steeper, they won't let you quit.

Of the powers that be?
If there was nothing to gain
Would you do it for free?
Would you do it for me?
Give it away in the bedroom
What you sell in the street
You spend a fortune on rags
And strip it down to the beat
I think you better ask yourself
Before you criticize me
Are you a victim of the system
Of the powers that be?
If there was nothing to gain
Would you do it for free?
Would you do it for me?
Are you in love with what you do?
Are you satisfied?
Is your heart straight and true?
Or did money make you tell a cold faced lie?
I think you better ask yourself
Before you criticize me
Are you a victim of the system
Of the powers that be?
If there was nothing to gain
Would you do it for free?
Would you do it for me?",Would You Do It for Free?,1997
Sammy Hagar,"I felt the earth move
I saw the sun rise
Knew who the stars shine for
Understood Ouspenski
Witnessed Velokowski's
Sunset rising at my door
Tracing my footsteps
Right down that slow train
I felt so relaxed so cool
What killed another fool
Just kept me sustained
So I just watch the mountains grow
Listen to the wind lie to me
Diggin' those changes on the radio
I'm cravin' some cool, cool water
I'm dying of thirst
Like some fool salted my circumcision
And the yogi's so high
But the difference is, little differences
I've never been so high
Only difference is, little differences
I'm stoned, stoned cold
I'm stoned, stoned cold
I'm stoned
I swear, I'm there, I'm stoned
First the silence, then the heat
Then fear sets in
Afraid you're gonna get an answer you don't want to hear
The truth puts blisters on my skin
Now, I got a problem with this whole concept, you see
Ain't no beginning, no end
It seems like every time I think I've arrived
A whole new trip begins
And the difference is, should I say, the problem is
I've never been so high
Only difference is, little differences
And the yogi's so high
But the difference is, little differences
I'm stoned
Stoned cold
Stoned, I'm stoned
Stone cold, I swear
I'm stoned, cold
Stoned
I'm there, I swear, I'm there
Stoned, so stoned",The Yogi's So High (I'm Stoned),1997

I wasn't lookin' for a big romance 
You play at love, you always take a chance, but I 
Never thought, I'd be losing ground so fast 
Don't know exactly what you did to me 
That started all this crazy, chemistry 
And I've been waitin' around, but, the thrill just hasn't passed 
Oh can't you hear it my 
HEARTBEAT 
Goin' faster and faster 
HEARTBEAT 
And its you that I'm after 
HEARTBEAT

Oh can't you feel it my

HEARTBEAT 
I'm so HOT with desire

Feel my......... Heartbeat 
Cause its all for you 
I only thought it was a one night stand 
But this affair has gotten, out of hand I'm 
Aware there's a feelin', I just can't keep it in 
Now I've gotta hold you, in my arms each night 
We hit the rythym and it sure feels right I gotta 
Justisify, my heartbeat doesn't lie 
Come close and feel it my
