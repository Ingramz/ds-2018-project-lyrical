Ryan Toby,"Just starin' at these four walls closin'
In on me, feelin' like time's frozen
Fadin' in and out, noddin' and dozin'
Guilt tearin' up my brain like erosion
What I did to you was wrong I admit it
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'
All alone in what used to be a home
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you
Talkin' slick like she ain't here
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click
I need to hit her with a brick
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge
With her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

[Chorus]
I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin' rain
Whylin' out screamin' yo' name
And keepin' ringin' yo' bell 'til you mad as hell
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere
And I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha
To show you I changed shawty

I seen you at the movies with some tall cat
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?
That's what I get for creepin' and crawlin'
Every other weekend gone until the mornin'
Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck
That was the old me, the one I still regret
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

[Chorus]

To show you I changed shawty
I really did change shawty (I'm tellin' you I've changed)
I wanna show you I changed shawty
(i still love you!) [cars peel]

I don't care if the cops got me surrounded
Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in
My mind's in an altered state
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes
I already played the fool when I let you escape
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex
Everything about you and yours connects
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'
Please find it in your heart to forgive me
Realize only god can convict me
We all make mistakes, so have you
If god show mercy on me, then you should too

[Chorus]

To show you I changed shawty
I really did change shawty (i'm tellin' you I've changed)
I wanna show you I changed shawty
(I still love you!) ow!
(I'm tellin' you I've changed)",I've Changed,2006
Ryan Whyte Maloney,"You must understand though the touch of your hand 
Makes my pulse react 
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl 
Opposites attract 
It's physical 
Only logical 
You must try to ignore that it means more than that 

What's love got to do, got to do with it 
What's love but a second hand emotion 
What's love got to do, got to do with it 
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken 

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused 
When you're close to me 
If a tend to look dazed I've read it someplace 
I've got cause to be 
There's a name for it 
There's a phrase that fits 
But whatever the reason you do it for me 

What's love got to do, got to do with it 
What's love but a second hand emotion 
What's love got to do, got to do with it 
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken 

I've been taking on a new direction 
But I have to say 
I've been thinking about my own protection 
It scares me to feel this way 

What's love got to do, got to do with it 
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion 
What's love got to do, got to do with it 
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken",What’s Love Got to Do With It,2014
RyanDan,"God on high, hear my prayer
In my need, you have always been there
He is young, he's afraid
Let him rest, Heaven blessed

Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

He's like the son I might have known
If God had granted me a son
The summers die, one by one
How soon they fly on and on
And I am old and will be gone

Bring him peace, bring him joy
He is young, he is only a boy
You can take, you can give
Let him be, let him live
If I die, let me die
Let him live

Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home",Bring Him Home,2007
RyanDan,"Vado con te nel mondo dei sogni
Dove tutto e' possible
All'alba come luna te vai
Ma nel cuore tuo mi porterai

Chorus:
E mentre il mondo gira
Ascolto la musica
Che canta la tua
Anima
Ma sono perso per te
Come lo sei tu per me
Per sempre sarai
Dentro me

Insieme tutto sembra magico
E voliamo come rondini
Anche se non see'e' piu la luce qui
Questo amore e' un lume dentro me

(Chorus 2x)
",Dentro Me,2007
RyanDan,"Traveler of the great divides
Vagrant on a path to life

Everyday feels a little closer
To where it is that you're headed for
Given to a hope of so much more

[Chorus]
For every time you fall apart
There'll be a soul to guide your journey
But if you choose to turn away
There in the mirror
You'll see my face
You'll see my face

Think you're on this road alone
Looking for a truth untold

Many times you've been close to breaking
Giving up and letting go
Something inside says it's not over

[Chorus]

And when the world crowds your space
Remember days when noise was silent
Now empty vows, loveless displays
Just a sense of knowing
You'd see my face
You'd see my face",The Face,2007
RyanDan,"Well here I am with so much to offer
Nothing to do but be here today
Giving myself it's the best I can do if I'm needed
Use my strength in anyway

[Chorus]
If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all open our eyes
We could see further
If we all stand tall enough no one can beat us
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

And all I ask is that we be honest
Do what we can if we're gonna stay
I want to make you a promise
Love and understanding
Is the game I want to play

[Chorus]

With my hands with my feet
When I dream when I sleep
From the start here inside I believe

If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

[Chorus]",High,2007
RyanDan,"I tried to hide from you
But I failed
I tried to lie to you
But how I failed
And even in my darkest time
You gave me light
I never knew this kinda love could feel so right
When I'm in your arms
I find myself believe it
We could be anywhere
So I can keep on dreaming

[Chorus]
Whenever your close to me, you're like the sun
You feel like the sun
And everyday you telling me
I am the one
I am the one who makes you shine

And I know
Whenever you want me to, I'll go
And even when your not with me
I feel you there
I only have to look and see
And I'll know where
When I'm holding you
The world can stop it's turning
You're always gonna pull me through
And I won't be returning

[Chorus]

You're like the sun
You keep me warm
You're telling me

When I'm in your arms
We can be anywhere
We can be anywhere

[Chorus]

I am the one who makes you shine

You're like the sun
You're like the sun",Like the Sun,2007
RyanDan,"I pray you'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

Let this be our prayer
When we lose our way
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

I pray we'll find your light
(I pray we'll find your light)
And holds it in our hearts
(And holds it in our hearts)
When stars go out each night
(When stars go out each night)
Remind us where you are

Let this be our prayer
(Let this be our prayer)
When shadows fill our day

Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

A world where pain and sorrow will be ended
And every heart that's broken will be mended
And we'll remember we are all God's children
Reaching out to touch you
Reaching to the stars

We ask that life be kind
(We ask that life be kind)
And watch us from above
(And watch us from above)
We hope each soul will find
(We hope each soul will find)
Another soul to love
(Another soul to love)

Let this be your prayer
(Let this be your prayer)
Just like every child
(Just like every child)

Needs to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Needs to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe",The Prayer,2007
RyanDan,"July we sat on the rooftop
Watching the city lights
School days and heartbreaks racing to each finish line
The first time I kissed her
Surprised that she kissed me back

Goodbyes
They put on their bravest faces and waved as I went
I left so unsure, not knowing where I would go next
The looks on their faces I kept, to remind me of home

[Chorus]
I think of my life
As moments in time
The ones you don't catch
Unless you look back
Are the moments that you keep your whole life through
That stay with you
That stay with you

She said, I love you but I just can't stay
I remember her hand and its weight
On my arm as she said its okay
She was right all along

[Chorus]

It's not about the money
It's not about regret
And it's not about the things that you wanted
That you never seem to get

[Chorus]",Stay with You,2007
RyanDan,"Cover my eyes
Cover my ears
Tell me these words are a lie
It can't be true
That I'm losing you
The sun cannot fall from the sky

Can you hear heaven cry
The tears of an angel
The tears of an angel
The tears of an angel
The tears of an angel

Stop every clock
Stars are in shock
The river would run to the sea
I won't let you fly
I won't say goodbye
I won't let you slip away from me

Can you hear heaven cry
The tears of an angel
The tears of an angel
The tears of an angel
The tears of an angel

So hold on
Be strong
Everyday hope will grow
I'm here, don't you fear

Little one don't let go
(Oh)
Don't let go
(Oh)
Don't let go
(Oh)

Cover my eyes
Cover my ears
Tell me these words are a lie",Tears of an Angel,2007
RyanDan,"Even roses need their thorns
Every evening needs its dawn
Just as rivers reach the sea
In that moment, you reached for me

And I never turned away
Best decision I ever made

[Chorus]
And I'll remember all my life
Maybe it was just one time
Can honestly say
That when it came to it I know at least
You needed me
You needed me

Now it's the measure of a man
That took me time to understand
That it takes courage to walk that road
You're the strongest I've ever known

Things may never be the same
But I'm still grateful, it turned out this way

[Chorus]

And until my final day
I will always feel the same

[Chorus]",You Needed Me,2007
Ryanhood,"Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play
Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play

Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
The wind is low the birds will sing
That you are part of everything
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?

Look around round
Look around round round
Look around

Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?

Ryanhood,"I've been thinking for way too long
About how many times
I've thought through all this before
Been pacing circles on the floor
Inside of a suitcase, eating on a map
Oh, I wake up I don't know where I am
And I need to touch, but I can't promise you that much
'Cause what once was hot, by two gets colder
And three, I'm looking over my shoulder
Wondering, what will I miss
If I commit to this, and choose to stay?

Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would
If I could stay
Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would

I've been thinking that it can't be wrong
Just to see where it leads, it might even be fun
But hey, what happens when I'm gone?
So then again, I think I should forget the whole thing?
'Cause waiting on a letter or the phone to ring
Just slowly breaks you
As you wait for words you think will make you stay

Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would
If I could stay
Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would

So it seems I can do nothing for you baby
Like this I can do nothing for you baby

Oh, I know that I should hold on tight
And not let that girl out of my sight
If it's worth the wait
If it's not too late
Then it's not okay
To let her get away

Ah, but you know that I would
You know that I would
If I could stay
Oh, you know that I would
You know that I would

Oh, I know that I should hold on tight
And not let that girl out of my sight
But I just keep playing the same old tapes
If I knew the way to change
You know that I would",Stay (You Know That I Would),2011
Ryattfienix,"Feeling like nobody knows me so I’m pouring out my soul
The game I’m in is lonely but this shit is all I know
Riding in my Chevy down this one way road
Taking it slow, but still I’m losing control
It’s just a day in the life
Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight
Yeah, it’s just a day in the life

Came up in the game just a youngin with a mean flow
Here to rock until the clock hits zero
Feel like I’m seeing the world through a peep hole
Stressed out, what you think I’m smoking weed for?
Gotta put one in the air like a free throw, or a G4
All these people doubting me and judging me without knowing me
So what you mean though?
Living life, what you hating on me for?
Oh you mad after finally getting mine
All these years on the grind I’m dropping shit
And now I’m getting shine, breaking records online
But every single one of my accomplishments
Comes at a cost, losing my mind
Always faded off of that pot prescript
Can’t slip up, I don’t got time
Nobody ever built a kind of watch for this
This life it’ll break you down so get ready
Living down this one way road in my Chevy
Carrying the weight of the world is too heavy
So let me show you people what it’s like being Webby
So doubt me, hate me, judge me, love me
Either fucking way I’m making it
'Cause I was made for this, yeah

Feeling like nobody knows me so I’m pouring out my soul
The game I’m in is lonely but this shit is all I know
Riding in my Chevy down this one way road
Taking it slow, but still I’m losing control
It’s just a day in the life
Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight
Yeah, it’s just a day in the life

See, everyone thinks they know how this life works
But they don’t see the negatives
On tour at least half of the year
Missing holidays and hardly seeing my relatives
They don’t know about the stress of the game
Everyday damn day, shit it got me popping sedatives
Like they fucking jelly beans, will I ever see the end of this?
If I do, shit, will I even remember it?
I don’t know man, all this rapping shit
Got me second guessing everything I had convinced
At the end of the day, fuck it I asked for this
I wouldn’t take it back for shit
I’ma soldier, with a good head on my shoulders
In it til I win it or I get a game over
Feeling like I’m on a roller coaster
Friends turn to foes and my heart grows colder
Drawn to the game like a moth to the flame
Sacrifice it all for the fame
But it’s all worth it when you up on stage and they calling your name
No doubt I’ll be paying the price in the end
But I’m cool now taking a right down the road untraveled
Seatbelt strapped in, this is just another day in the life

And I’m feeling like I’m losing my mind
This game will lock you up for certain
But I’m doing my time
I keep a smile on my face, I keep my head to the sky
And in the end I know I’ma be alright

Feeling like nobody knows me so I’m pouring out my soul
The game I’m in is lonely but this shit is all I know
Riding in my Chevy down this one way road
Taking it slow, but still I’m losing control
It’s just a day in the life
Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight
Yeah, it’s just a day in the life

Yeah, to all my friends and family
To all the fans
Thank you for believing in me, man
We here now",Day in the Life,2014
Rydah J Klyde,"Play with fire,
You get burned
When the heat was on
I turned
Turned to trouble
Trouble

[verse 1]
Yeah yeah c-3
New Orleans baby the street called eagle
And everybody's ill yea illegal
People steal cars we steal people
We eat like dogs but we're still people
And even when your lost trouble still see you
And even if your dead broke we are still equal
One time for the little people eat your meal
Don't let the meal eat you

(I run to trouble)
Street runners
Your running me crazy with this one

Run
With
Trouble

[Verse 2]
And just the other day my nigga Chris killed himself
I pray to god that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when theres no help
He figured heaven so he went left
Ya'll know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds come and bells ringing
(i run to trouble, trouble)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama know the drug dealers straight quit her job
He took his life and along with him I died
And she died
We died...
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me, ""daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes and see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over the 1
Still I look for better times
I run with trouble, trouble...

You know
Just kicking back
(Though I look for brighter times)
I am carter
(I run to trouble)
Ya know
(Trouble)

[Verse 2]
The tooley poked out the jeans
The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans
Ya nah mean
And everything ain't what it seems
Ya nah mean
Don't play that game without your team
Kill for my bread
Kill for my g's
Kill for my cream
I will have that red beam on high beam
Now I hear sirens
Wait I think I see one behind me
I ain't tripping baby
Money got me, uh
And fuck the police
Fuck the feds too
I ain't jumping in that jumpsuit
A blunt too

Check me out
I fuck around and check you
Respect due
Pay yours nigga
Mines under the seat by my feet
Wheres your nigga
Too much whores nigga huh
Too much pressure
Too much force
Too much money
You never heard that before
Shit, and we stop these snitches at the door
Cut the tail off the rat he wont rat no more
Whack
No more
Thats right
Get trapped fucking with my cheese
Keep shooting till I burn my sleeve
Nigga please
These boys is g's
Represent New Orleans like a Florida leash

Rydia,"Well I guess you left me with some feathers in my hand
Did it make it any easier to leave me where I stand?
I guess there might not be too many who would stand beside you now
Where'd you come from? Where am I going?
Why'd you leave me 'till I'm only good for...

Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

Every night these silhouettes appear above my head
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper
Every time I fall asleep Every time I dream
""Did you come? Would you lie?
Why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for...

Waiting for you""
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed
Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book
Suck my blood break my nerve offer me their arms
Well, I will not be an enemy of anything
I'll only stand here

Waiting for the dude to come down my way,
Praying, wishing, hoping, thinking,
And I felt my emotions sinking.
I've been waiting for the phone to ring,
I check constantly, but it was all a dream
I never thought you could be so mean!
Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean
And why do boys have to be so shady?
First it's all good and he's glad you his lady
Baby this, baby that, see another chick and he act like that.

And you wanna feel his touch,
Put your hand in the air, let them know that you truly care

All the lies and the trust games,
Guessing, age don't make a difference,
And I'm getting fed up, so listen!
First you told me that you loved me dearly,

I loved you, did I make that clearly?
And you're thinking that you can play my game,
But I wanna think twice, so retain my claim
And I'm kinda mad at myself, cause I let you get the best of me,
To confess to me, her

Oh boy, I'm through!
Tell that chick that she better get at you

That's never.
Suppose she made you happy or whatever
Learn from the past, proceed, get better

Guess you didn't realize just what you had

I get naughty, I get crazy, I get slizzy, but never get lazy
Girls like me wanna have fun
No time for the bitches that be actin' all drunk
You can like me, but don't bite me
All you chicks now wanna come and fight me
Can't help that I come off lightly
And your girlfriend wanna be just like me
Heard you lookin' for a bo-bo-boss
That be me, ain't worried about the cost
If you thinkin' you can cost some shoots
Pick a game motherf-cker, 'till you're right to cause
Purdy kid, come up with the sayin'
I'm a brawl like the lastest slein'
I'm a let it go cold like a shot
And I call all night 'cause I just can't stop

I was broken by the breeze
And running from the ones behind me, just
In it for the game, a wild thing to tame
But you took my hand and ran beside me

I'm slipping up under my feet
Hallelujah, I believe
Hear my heart beat, major keys
Nothing competes
When love is free

My compass may be broke
But you follow where I go
And you never really seem to mind it, sun
Stare it in the eye, now I'm blinded by the light
But seeing you with eyes wide open

I'm slipping up under my feet
Hallelujah, I believe
Hear my heart beat, major keys

No, the world isn't flat it's a circle instead
You can run to wherever you want to now

And those dizzy stargazers
Who dreamed of the black, kept their heads in the clouds and they
Never looked back, they kept wandering
And never did they look down

Charting Neptune by the fire of the sun
Kept looking for new constellations
New constellations

There's no walls and no ceilings as far as I know
Just the echoes of scars and the unbeaten road
Trip the gun on cautions that I've been sold

'Cause it's hard to believe that it's wrong
To want more than the truest of blue and a love like a roar
I will run to wherever I want to go

Oh, charting Neptune by the fire of the sun
I'm looking for new constellations
New constellations

So keep calling me crazy 'cause I never learned
You should stop loving fire because you got burned
Now it feels like I'm living some sick déjà vu
Like the answers were there when I stared into you

Child of Neptune, I'm the daughter of the sun
Keep showing me new constellations
New constellations

And now I'm frozen in your headlights
Deep in the haze of your love high

I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

I can't take it

I can't take it, can't believe I really lost you, baby

From the day I saw my heart start breaking

Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed
And you're the dynamite in my chains
Deep in the trench of the cross-fire
You shot me down from the live-wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating, ch-cheating and now I can't play

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it, can't believe I really lost you, baby

Know I want you but there's nothing left to say

Caught in the middle, you played me
See so plainly

Drank with the devil and forgot my name
Woke with somebody when the morning came
No one there to shame me for my youth
'Cause I wouldn't be with you

And then I found me a lover who could play the bass
He's kinda quiet, but his body ain't
Spend the days dreaming and the nights awake
Doin' things we know we shouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't be with you

Says he can't believe he found me
Wraps his arms around me

I'll call your bluff and

So, call my bluff, I'll
Keep on telling, telling, telling you lies

And I fell for a vagabond, a month at tops
Lied and said his bike was in the ""motor shop
Drove my car once and made the tire pop
Still we had some fun, till I came to
'Cause I wouldn't be with you

On the Fourth of July, I met a man, Pierre
Lied about his age, but I didn't care
Spoke in broken English but the heart was there
In those eyes of sky and ocean blue

Wraps his arms around me

Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2002
Ryo Kawasaki,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad

The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me and

Ryunosuke,"Look for us in Cali - east bay to LA
Or with our friends in DC - the UST
We made it through the Canadian border
Back home next week in NYC

Because we`re faster than the world we can`t slow down

I hear the windy city calling - chitown, chitown
As we arrive in Tokyo - edemio
And the kids are cool in Kansas
Tomorrow`s the Philly troc show

New York City - you can`t slow down
East coast to the west coast - you can`t slow down
Japan to Europe - you can`t slow down
World wide hardcore punks - you can`t slow down

Bust bullet holes on the charts, I want the number one spot
What's the science? I'm a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, o-ccured when I slammed in
Program the jams, to be fat as Ralph Kramden
Others come with shit, as silly as Art Carney
But my Tetley triplizes, more kids than Barney
Remedy for stress is three bags of sess
A day at my rest, playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin, I take the queen, with the rook then
I get vexed, layin phat trax on Ampex
Puffin skunk, gettin drunk off of Triple X
Violent time, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine

My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leaving mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I grip your style like a spasm
Drag 'em through the mud then I bag em
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my pores
And I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
Like jail, electrifying like the third rail
Beats are smashed with paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang! (Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit)

Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen
Enemy, is the industry got me flippin
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
I'm killin, snipin, catchin murder cases
Desert Stormin', I be searchin for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the four nine three eleven

(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
I don't know what's going on if you can take us there

Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggas best to be careful crossin
The street, before they end up layin in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggas tend to forget, however
Peep this — my nigga Kase lives forever

What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the shadow, street-life, flowin again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kick would knock the hinges off the door
The dread tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
Just when I said, ""Where the fuck's the cream?""
Another dread came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast three shots like rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it
Niggas said, ""Carlton you'se a ill motherfucker""

Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don

I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps

Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial

Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

God stepping forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of

Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells more like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions

Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out

It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He was just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standin when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors, by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw

Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manor
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggaz he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggaz be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House

Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S.
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
in his country, even though he sold mad weed
for the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggaz actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
at the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the CREAM
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggaz I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
without a doubt, niggaz who front, get snuffed out

Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this b**** advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Bla** and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line
I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter
From the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark
Pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered
My unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible
Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retreat through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God
His shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra
UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops know
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

[Verse One: RZA]
Put away your heaters, throw up your dick beaters
Accurate blows to his nose shut his eyes closed to a centimeter
Bitches on the fences wonderin what the fuck the suspense is
I land heavy uppercuts in the corner of the park fences
Knocked his mouthpiece front teeth got locked inside my knuckle
He grabbed the belt buckle, attempt to catch me with a couple
of low blows to the nuts, on ringside was as a giant do-els
Send your Barb for this fuckin jew On a Wire
He couldn't chessbox that's when he reached for his ahhs
Brother chopped me on the top of my knot, but he got stopped
When a twelve ounce bottle of Bartyle and James had him startled
A bitch threw it caught him in his head, at full throttle
He fell, the glass crashed, he wasn't saved by the bell
That was his ass black
So when it comes to physical combat
We can take it hand to hand or go beyond that
Do you want my gat to make the contact?
Retirin cats who lack the heart to fire back?
[We take all crabs overboard]

Chorus: Raekwon
Put down the gun son, son matter of fact, shoot the one on one
Hold it down, make sure the head, sure nuff don't hit the ground
Lampin on the handball courts, or the square, we can take it there
Settle it son, who the champion?

[It's like that, niggaz want to front, one more time?
 I'ma show you like this. One on each side
 This is it word up. We gonna lay you back
 We gonna rest your back, you won't know how to act
 When it come to bigger, showin and provin
 Niggaz styles is wack] Who the champion? Settle it son.

Verse Two: Ghostface Killer
Yo!
I had to run up on this King at Devine, for his shines
He saw the stash and caught my mailbox for eighty dimes
He saw me stashin, like a pipe-link for mega fiends
I held it down like the finger fly miraculous King
Peep through the heavy small get the camoflouge
Starks master in charge, pushin through ery buildin, sippin egg nog
Niggaz know my status God body carry big batters
Fiends know me for my blue bags, besides smackin crabs
and earnin mine, this bitch Sha cat, gotta get his back bent
What the hell just made him fuck with my intelligent?
Back to Polly and I heard some noise we pack a two twelve
There go Lord Shamel, faggot made a sale
He's sellin my shit, I should slap fire out his ass
Snap his bones in half and watch the stock market crash
I walked up on him, he had the nerve to say Peace God
Ain't nuttin Peace God, you stole it now we out in the streets
Take your shit off, nigga you soft, back up off
Youse a shady nigga, I'm a sever fig you with a gloss
I snuffed him, threw a crazy left and I cuffed him
Allah don't like ugly so I held back from bustin him
I passed the burn off, he caught me from the blind side
Tapped a nigga jaw, I shot my fifty-two style, and crazy raw
I had my ice on, tapped a few times, he started leakin
De King with the deadarm, Shamel fell to his knees and
He started wheezin, losin his breath from smokin trees and
I'm still breathin, bleedin because it's frontin season
Now I got that project belt, international/national
Worldwide, I let Shamel slide

Move forward, I talk with the awkward slang

Heavy thoughts can't be held down by the laws of gravity 
Watch for the lime in the temple tryin' to plot your tragedy 
The game ain't quit, to hide pistols at the banquet 
For attemptin' to hijack the Wu-Tang Manual under his blanket 
Can't interpret cause your brain is short circuit 
This dumbness left your body numbness try to come amongst us 
What's your angle? Rectangle or triangle? 
As my truth of square drains you of your power the death angel 
Strangles you like a weed, choking the helpless flower, you cower 
You feel the power of the final shower! 

Here comes the rain again 
Falling on your head like a tragedy 
Falling on your head causing new demotions 
Not even the naked eye, can see 
Not e-eeven the naked eye, can see

Strong, reflect this 'til I'm drawn back to the essence 
Street wise, thirty six waist, small feet size 
The C.I.'s quick to slide off, once the heat rise 
Detour, poverty's on, police war 
Grown through each dawn, searchin' new ways for me to eat more 
Fast learner, quiet storm, play the back burner 
Bureaucrats, I react like Nat Turner 
Hold weight, used to rock kicks wit no lace 
Fuck a soul mate, low heart pace, pulse at a slow rate 
Runnin' rapid, while others play as if they captive 
Brain's inactive, bein' subjected to this crab shit 
To each his own, fuck the foulness, need a week alone 
We can zone, all day long, on the speaker phone 
Six hundred, nine five North, stay blunted, stress I came from it 
Sex got drained from it 
The new breed star gazin', raisin' two seeds 
To be free, the franchise is all a whole crew need, indeed 

Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past? 
Whatever happened to the realness from back in the past? 

Whips and full clips and pussy lips 
Rubber grips attached to hips 
Past the journey to the crib, the purest sickness cura 
Holy Koran, sirah, leaves man to understand, I stand up as rough briva 
Heart is bleedin', stress got my hair line receedin' 
God look we feedin', leadin' my seeds, back to Eden 
And stay suspicious of promiscuous bitches 
Who don't wash and do dish and to big for your britches 
Lustin' riches, fuckin' the next man mistress 
You wonder why your pussy itches, fat ass sample wit out the glitches 
Shatter your mental, split your bean up like a lentel 
Disfigure your face, you recognizin' by the dental 
Hot lead from raw heat, left in store meat 
Lay it out on Broadstreet, before he 
Left all he heard was the echo from the shot 
Cops all tops see revealed, he was stopped by the Glock 
Devils lettin' off SCUDS, thugs trapped up in HUD houses 
New York, been infested by Bloods, lustin' for colors of red 
More black lies done shed through 
Yet the blood travelin' through veins remain blue 
Boned out until we zone out, no doubt 
Chickenheads beg for the nine inch Applehead 
Their legs open like fallopian, lubricated by petroleum 
Nine months later comes the ovary explosion 
Bitch you stupid? A hundred dollars you couldn't recoup it 
When I reign the truth on your brain you muted 
Rula Zig-Zag, Zig Allah, plus Allah Zig, Zag-Zig 
We addin' more knowledge to your wig 

Yo major large niggas get they grind on cash, while the crab thinkin' 
Niggas keep they mind on ass 
I guess most motherfuckers ain't designed to last

Flame tucked down to my nuts, on my last buck
Only thing keep a nigga calm is a good fuck
Loose-leaf cigarettes be dipped in wet
Chicken of the seas get trapped inside my net
With their clothes off, son when the gun goes off
I'm bound to play Napoleon, and blow a nose off 
Your Sphinx; your stumble rap style, your flow's off

Unchallenged sword I yield the storm rider
Clip full of ruffled-tip fast-actin long fire
Four hundred grain cartridge, with steel casin
Those who can't draw the crowd is still tracin
The mic is cast to the floor and shapeshifted
Heavy as the hammer of Thor you can't lift it
So tense, bitch there's no defense

Right eye squinted; I speak brok-len english

And roosters walk around with their heads in the perm

Your heart was mutual, into the center I dove 

Backstroke in your abyss like a fish 

Countin every thought and dream and wish, that exists within six 

She was filled with pleasures, of all measures 

But never took the time to discover, her own sunken treasure 

Unlock the jewelry box, knowledge rose to the top 

The distilled back in the fine mists, that gave birth to the crops

up with knowledge and wisdom you understandin 

that bring forth the power refines your whole planet

She claimed it never rains, down in Southern California 

Bein a black man is most prominent and all dominant 

I couldn't wait to get her home so I could explore her dark continent 

And put my fountain, between her hills and mountains 

Impingin every square inch of her circumfrence I was countin 

Twelve trillion, four hundred and seventy-eight billion 

one hundred and eighteen million, four hundred thousand ways 

to make children, by buildin 

Detected a fine mist but couldn't resist, I told her, 

""You want to travel inside my head and see if you could rise above six?"" 

Then tilt her at the axis then bent her at her equator 

and stuck the diamond might deep inside the crater

Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell

Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps

15 twenty inch woofers blow the manhole

Made the street crack, master feedback
Allah masters the beat back
The crowd look, while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed

Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tonnes of snow
Broke this rhymin' video
Verbal assassin, blastin'
Exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously

Game controlled, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable, long-life cover
Very similar to no other

I seen a million tryin' to set a flow, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual thing forgot the Fri show
Now his pursuit is not for digress

A special note, thanks for being flank
While journalist's stay runnin' in front of tanks
Blew out first class, came back close cash
Ruff class, surfaces with no math

Military campaign
While shots cause information of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Filled with pain, niggaz reign

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

Verse One: RZA

Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt solos
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
and spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
and stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Chorus: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

Verse Two: Cappadonna

Pele egg-head the top dresser
One man catalog the London Fog casual hog
Biere denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket he gripped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy started haveta brown skin derby
master Tommy Hil Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cap and fleece wear
One wear plaids the Don will hold the best for all wear
plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on
We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear

Verse Three: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Just come see me
satisfaction guaranteed baby
Just hold your own baby
and just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low

Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics

Just hold your own baby
Now just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low

RZA,"What dey gives you blood?
Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway?  You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy?
Thirteen
Thirteen?  Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box 
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again
Heheheh, yeah heheheheh ahaheheheh

Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen want to be callin' me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shoppin' spree you're lovin'
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets

RZA,"Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld tote mm-hmm

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more

A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold

Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up

From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims

The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg

Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect

Respect the Bloods and Crips a lot
Plus the God from Ride saggin' in his seat, blastin' Wu beats
Tryin' to plot his next hit
He took a drag of the eight elements that composed, atmospheric gas
'Bout to let off his sword, and full blast
Kept his mind focused, meditation position half lotus
Abbot's sword novas couldn't match his magnum opus
Deluxe stroke, son move like a ghost
Struck in an instance, unnoticed like a lamp post
Radar sharp precision gunfire, explode
Till his clips unload, it's a samurai code

RZA,"The way of the samurai is found in death
Meditation of inevitable death should be performed daily
Every day, when one's body and mind are at peace
He should meditate up on being up to blocked 
By arrows, rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown in to the midst of a great fire
Being struck by a lightning, and shaken to death by a great earthquake
Falling from thousand foot cliffs, dying of a disease
Committing seppiku at the death of one's master
In everyday when one fails, one should consider himself as dead
This is a substance of the way of a samurai

Till any wicked germ is destoryed and burned

Hopeful that, lick your cannon
I'm ill when I shoot to peal like Ed O'Bannon
In my head is a thought, perm cocked, off safety
Shots fired, follow blood trails to the stairwell
Faced down, he lay sound, rounds to his crown
Shorty hip flock was midtown, big fly holdin him down
With the dead-arm, siren sounds
Bullets chip brick, precincts followed by the ambulance
Respond to the bomb threat
I picked up his MC tray through the masters
I'm sharper than my carpentry blade

Chop the O, sprinkle a lil' snow inside a Optimo

That's how you lost your first job, punk
Now, get in line, for you get your lil' thick-ass tossed up

He was on the fourth, I was on the third

Pass me a honey-dipped spliff, black mental cause continental drift
One whiff of Pow, you gets my divine stiff
Brick rock, late night, hear the tick-tock of my clock
I used to run up and pick a crab lock

Hit his stash, dip back, to the Lab, make him flip
Uptown, boo-doop, now we back on your ass
Incognito, fatal aikido blow, pop a needle
Dick a knock-knee hoe, bust out her fetal

Nine inch long, strong, Bobby pop the bitch thongs
Spit on her, then I banged on my chest like Kong King
Merciless Meng, point the killa bee sting
Ring dings right through your head bing

Snap the wing off of bats, my battle-axe tongue hacks tracks
Once the ball drop, I'ma snatch ten jacks
Pass the crack to a niggarette, puff a looseleaf cigarette
While your man search the Internet for Bob Digitech

In Stereo, crazy as Shapiro
Multiply myself ten times standin' next to zero
And snap my fingers like the Fonz
And bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde

Dip hair, make a nigga flip in his chair
Had the armpit shaved off perfect with the Nair
Stomach fat as a pancake for her man's sake
Used to fuck her when she menstruate
But it made her hyperventilate

Yeah it's Bobby Digital
Just floatin' over +The City+
I came across this, this, this black man
He was talkin' about (look down below)

Sure of yourself risin', prices of food sky rises
Foreign countries movin' and USA enterprises
Snatchin' your mic then speakin'
While you might be leakin'
Then losin' the luxury, average man be seekin'
Thought he was so smart
Hoe's cheatin', life fall apart
Fuckin' a hundred bitches couldn't measure the broken heart
Start as a soda jerk job, as a mail clerk
Fucked this white bitch in the office, got fired from work
Nine-to-five, government high taxes, police dispatches
Pure accretive attackin' black Asiatics
Resident with bad plumbin'
Cocaine got my brain numb an' bitch complained 'bout cummin'
Pussy stay hummin'
$200 parkin', Sommers' out of state warrants
High blood pressure pills prescribed by Dr. Lawrence
Got me gainin' weight, fuckin' up my right kidney
Cousin raped that school allow' with me
Peoples' eyes closed like envelopes by folk membership
With unpaid doctor bills, framed got shot and killed
Cock, pop and pilled
Three-tenth cotton steel closet
Cabinet of +No Frills+
Mo' bills since he got evicted from Park Hill
Punch a hole inside the NARC wheels
My dogs bark, still carry dark steel
And unmarked bills up on the uncut dope found on director's wheel
Bobby Digital may switch back to Bobby Steels
Rusty .38's, bought rust inside the herb gate
So +Hungry+, son, 'bout to shrink down to a bird's weight
Fast break out, with the blue ointment, face-to-face appointments
Un-proudly in the church paid for annointment
Then the cheques will come late
About to separate with her man
In +The City+, +Domestic Violence+ excavates
Get a highest ratio in five years
The idea is to plant fear
Boy you slap your bitch, po' licensed there to cuff you or snuff you
They might bust you
'cause your hoe snatched your money up, didn't want to fuck you
We must learn to communicate, and unificate
Stop the black on black, hate on hate
White on white, black on white
Put the love and love
I'm blunted up, blastin' inside the strip club
Shorty wop, fifteen year old, all she needed was love
And mo' dough so she won't have to show her knotty afro
Collect dough for my son the bouncer, he might have blow 'dro
Foul cut, copped the three-to-six
Bad situations, bein' a man is hard shit
Somethin'll get trapped out, I mean, yo
Got crack fiends in spots with vaccine shots
Black teens drop out of high school, white teens sellin' stock
Wines, they can't print the word on
Shorty wop pussy, 'bout to swerve on
Up in the crib, new bridge, of dead pig
Two kids, pawned this older cat who looked like Calvin Crewhig?
But got splat in his back last year
Robbin' his jewel inside the diamond district
No more Doctor Victor, heard they never found the biscuit
A groupie trapped by the Cap' with the lisp
Tryin' to sound cist, sometimes happiness got grits and catfish
Or fortune cookie crisp, I got harassed by this rookie bitch
Talkin' 'bout I couldn't put my feet on the fire hydrants
And timed my kids, fifty-dollar ticket, time to strike a cricket
And shot up the city hall, mothafuck the wicked
Too greedy, give to the needy, down on my luck
'bout to jab a ouija board, that's when Bobby Digi seen me
Said, ""Yo, son, don't stress over no one, roll a slow one
Knowledge is half the battle, that's one to grow on
And don't be counterfeit

Fingerprint proof rubber grips
Hollow tip clips
Eight ounce sip bud nips
We crack private do chips
And clock a bird off the block
Straight away from a flock
Just caught me at the bus stop
Twist the Snapple top
Off, pierced her breast
Kept her hair processed
No panties underneath the dress
Wally ankle bracelet
Polo frames
Her shades had no name
Popocane
I slowed my game
Thick gold chains
Make your eyes flame
Up against the Bodega gate

To bust her grape

Don't splash it
Pop a joint and blast it
The shit sound
Hype in your whip
Make you take the car and crash it
Megagraphical
Always speak actual
Only deal with natural
One hundred percent
Five percent
Militant in aim
With the intent
Beretta Nine, blast mine

[Intro: RZA (Method Man)]
Come on my niggas, yo..
Put your guns in your right hand and hold it down towards the floor
Point all your guns down towards the floor for a minute
Yeah, you could hold 'em, just point 'em down towards the floor
For a sec, aight? (Yo why'all ain't fuckin' wit the Wu)
We gon' splash like this, all my wild Digi heads
(Y'all niggas is crook) why'all niggas move a little up to the front
why'all niggas know what I'm talkin' about
Word up, my weedheads, why'all play the right for a second
Nahmean? Check it out
All why'all niggas on X, why'all keep why'all asses in the back
Aight? Straight up, in fact, matter of fact
We gon' mingle this shit like mothafuckin' peas in the mothafuckin' pot
Straight up Digi Digi style, word up, as we splash you right
(Yeah, yeah, my niggas is crew, now why'all ain't
fuckin' wit the Wu
Oh now why'all.. come on!)

[RZA]
Walk wit a didi bop ock, you silly pop, Jiffy Pop
Fuck around, son, I'll blow ya face up with fifty shots
Sharp darts, and it pop pop like tarts
Extreme speed like Anakin inside the Pod
Headed for the finish line, BOODOO, watch Bobby cross it
Hoes with the diamonds on your toes, come on and floss it
I be one of those tall skinny cats with the four-nine
Three-eleven that rips through Power-you's and breaks spines
I culture power-tuggin' boys who be drunk, buggin'
Lovin' loud noise from toys, club thuggin'
Sweet chocolate deluxe, rugged, sexy buttercup
That don't give a fuck about the cop in the club
Or the bouncer with the flashlight, one walked passed, right?
Some pulled the razor and chopped his ear like he was Mad Mike
I played the cipher in the corner, teachin' math
One for one thoughts, a hundred brothers won't last
Because you can't do me.. (x3)

""Do you feel?""
Come on!
[Prodigal]
Yo, son, +Wake Up+! {*coughs*}
Yo, I gotta do this, man
I gotta get this money, son

Features in the crowd, appearance like, ""Black I'm proud""
In the background, no sounds, four pound, we hold ground!
Brooklyn bound, seven initials up in the crown
One man's ramblin', officials they shot him down
Supreme, extreme, lean, killin' machines
All I want to do is feed my seed, plus my team
Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal
Diabolic drums and I run from none
Testimony one, give my life before my only son
Thelonious crumbs, why they want to press me for guns?
Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug
From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs
As +It Was Written+, stroll through any block forbidden
Glock hidden, why they want to stop precision?
Eighty-five percent of my brothers locked in prison
And we just keep dyin' for the love of good livin'
But Do you! Do you! Do you!

""Do you feel?"" (x2)
[GZA]
You know those jams in the park, produced the spark
Made me feel words how I read books in the dark
I always took it to heart, loved the art
A lifetime of darts, ripped crews apart
Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport
Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die
Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry
My opponent block, the beat comin' from his box
Investment ranker who's a joke in the stocks
Keep a rhythmic pace, maintainin' great balance
Movin' in steps of unheard of silence
Normally progressioners, they're slow steepin'
Niggas want to light up when there's gas leakin'

More peaches than cobbler, corner store soliciter

and what you need, and what you get is two different things
Pulled over, Pea Street, and put the bitch out in the rain
Lost your mind, ya 409, riding the short yellow bus

Bodododo, plus her knees be purple, Gipp, she like to gurgle gurgle
And goggle, goggle, slurpy slurp and she swallow swallow
I met this Caramel Sundae, her name was Betty Boo
She put her period blood in her spaghetti stew (fuck no! fuck no!)
I knew her mama, her papa, plus her naughty daughter
She filled her baby's ba-ba up with toilet water
And Sun Dew, the whole Clan used to run threw
Her Power you, then just bless her wit the hair doo
Bitch, I pack a horse dick, plus you know my chain is frosted
One fuck from the apple head and shorty lost it

Niggas was psyched out, Beretta brought the dirt bike out
Everlast just came home, it was his first night out
He was arguin' with these bitches how they don't mind their business
When he was locked the fuck down, no one came to visit
He was snuffed, black, his little cousin Moe stuck Cap
That's Miss Sommers on the bike with the gat like, ""Fuck that""
But finessin' over here, he could've wished he had ten more years
Cracked a cold beer then bust a shot in the air
Everlast, ego went full blast, didn't splash
He'd act like his head was too big for the casket
I told him, ""Slow down God, you ain't wild
You ain't been in these projects in a while
Runnin' 'round with that old school style""
Don't think these young bucks won't lay you down like tile
A hard head makes a soft ass, these New York lads
Chopped faces, you talk fast - they bust off fast
And chase you out the hood, in a bloody hood
Yo, son, you seen that kid was actin' Hollywood?

[Killa Sin]
Yeah, I mean that nigga, clap happy Cali, clap when he 'ttack
Most get astounded by sorrounded sound effects in the back
Adidas shoe, phat laces, packin' buldge in his jacket
Head nappy, black and nasty, but he nasty for gats
He nas', passed me, bumped me and laughed, then flashed me his Mac
Said, ""I got sixteen for you, we could bang on the track""
So strap this, nah, this bar's a bullet, par pull it
In fact, blast me bastard, I done came to far for this

Boulevard life, remember late nights?
Mama stomach touchin' a bed, two bids
Cats sacky in Comstack, retire from the crack
I'm askin' Allah that the warm Hennessy help me
I ain't chose the struggle, the struggle chose me
Lord forgive me fore I have stolen from my brothers
Snaked my brothers, even killed my brothers
Familiar fishscale, everybody plays the fool
The +Older Gods+ givin' me jewels
The younger Gods givin' me tools
Solomon Allah, I feel I was jerked
To the drug dealers, my baby mother's a flirt
Holey socks, one fatigue suit, what you feel it don't hurt?
That's my problem now, I ain't afraid to talk
Still cop coke from the well Willy
When I was young I got robbed from the neighborhood bully
'Til he forced me to hit him with the nine milli'
Now him and his click know that I'm a thug fully

with nothin but my words as my weapon

Two bags of chips, and one pack of Now & Laters
Flame tucked down to my nuts, on my last buck
Only thing keep a nigga calm is a good fuck

Loose-leaf cigarettes be dipped in wet
Chicken of the seas get trapped inside my net
with their clothes off, son when the gun goes off
I'm bound to play Napoleon, and blow a nose off -

your Sphinx; your stumble rap style, your flow's off
like Kunta, tryin to run with his chopped toes off
Unchallenged sword I yield the storm rider
Clip full of ruffled-tip fast-actin long fire

Four hundred grain cartridge, with steel casin
Those who can't draw the crowd is still tracin
The mic is cast to the floor and shapeshifted
Heavy as the hammer of Thor you can't lift it

So tense, bitch there's no defense
This four-four inch'll make you jump the fence
Right eye squinted; I speak brok-len english
Stumble off the cold four-oh of Olde English Wu brew

Another girl, you're tricking me
I gotta go 'cause I thought that I was yo' baby

Oh, baby, baby, you was acting so crazy

You try to play slickly, said you strictly dickly
But you and your friends, you play the licky licky
I figured it out when I caught that hickey

Between yo' legs with yo' chocolate slippy
Now Bob busy, gotta taught you like Frisbee
Out the window, off and away you go
Ain't got no time and no love for hoes, fuck

How many project sluts wanna nut or get touched?
And ramped up in the back of my truck
Or to eat the Benz up when yo' girlfriend would
Have her knees to her ears so I can slip in good

Bobby now walk the block with black hoody hat
Dog on the prowl upon to snatch the little putty cat
Red Red Riding Hood and I'm the Big Woof
'Bout to puff off these pistols like I'm George Bush

And push, push through your power you
Goosh, goosh explode my load
Have it running down your toosh, toosh
Now you speaking the round like a crook, crook
Trying to look inside my phone book, book

'Bout to loose it all, girl, you shook, shook

It ain't my fault that your love got jooks, jooks
It ain't my fault that your love got jooks

I gotta go 'cause I thought that you were my, baby

c'mon man, save it, go ahead with that, boo
Oh, you take me for a fool, I shit my sister for you
Claim on sneaking, sleeping, creeping, cheating, you bugging, yo
Listening to yo' cousin now because she a lonely hoe

Siffle fickle minded dizzy trying to insult I
Now you wanna go and turn around and to ask why

Ya switched the whole current and if that's how you feel
Be out, be out, yo, be the fuck out

But why do some it wasn't me?

As the snowflakes start to fall
Bobby thought to himself, can he possibly survive?
Then out of nowhere a stream of energy struck
As he boosted, joined energy wit the Sun
The Seven is shining, and the kids all felt happy!
You are listening to the worlwide Digital Radio Show

Bob Digital located inside the hood again
Last seen helpin the crack fiend in detox
Smackin this cat in his head for snatchin Reeboks
Cut the dreadlocks, son, I rock the bald Caeser
Allow God to slip through the shit more easier
Police pulsated that they almost trapped Bobby
Near the staircase outside a 240 lobby
But son just disappeared in thin air
Where you crab niggas want to go, I've been there
Carry big guns, without bein parried
Yo, Cali niggas say its carried
Yo, don't waste your mind on time, don't chase the blind
Don't eat swine, don't play with loaded 9's
Don't quote weak rhymes
If you approached by a brother in need, give him shine

Show him light, don't get emotional, son, don't fight
Unless it's self-defense, to break the savage backs
So he's crew could be convinced
That any time you cross the line, we snap spines
Split ya melon, down to the rind
You be fucked up, yo..

Yo, try to cross reference, my epic preference
Fresh mint, tight lint, you get trapped inside the monkey wrench
Ain't no man lover ever gonna silk the sealer
I'm blessed like the seed who sucked the milk from Mahalia
You wishin' Shaolin Island could be swallowed up by the sea
Gobbled up, like the lost city of Moore and Atlantis
But I'm fierce as the cyclone winds that blew through Kansas
Have your clan stranded on the enchanted land of Gumas Azubar
Gem blue star, razor blade scar
Who dare want to spar bar for bar? Allah you Akbar
I turn the most degenerate hood into a pop star
Bless the seed who prays the Most High, without askin' why
Flicks from ocean shore, kick like Marshall Law
I might strike with the eagle claw or tiger paw
On the shores of African beach, facin' the east
White sands stretched out as far as the eye can see
Found buried by the sea
The heat of Allah son will crack through Antarctica
We ride blue whales, you sell Nautica ships on the carpenter
We should send all these Devils back to Hell 
You small as to die in my sentence, I speak with vengeance
Snatch up 17 million plus 2 million Indians 
Your incorrect retrospect on the situation
You didn't know it was a Wu-Tang affiliation
Legs speak like twigs, you're forbidden like pig

Cursed the ancestors and the seed of the assailant
Dissect his body like an alien

Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head
All you niggas out there who got money 
better watch out for the money hungry
Straight up...
The most beloved from a region undiscovered
I've been hovered over by black buzzard walkin' through public
Imagine the feelin' of growin' up, ten children
Stuffed inside a shack, in the project buildings
Women, infants and coupons, one stole camel soup on
Stressed out with four kids, aborter
Next door the dope fiend neighbour tryin' to sell his little daughter
Poisonous, heat from the oven
The only way we had to live was survivin' off mommy's lovin'
Dead bodies found in the incinerator
Lights Out, somebody fucked up the generator
Talkin' welfare, cheese, franks and beans
Mud stains on mock-neck shirts and tainted jeans
Twisted up, how the fuck we get bended up?
And ended up in this four block radius where they enslaved us
Sweatin' from cheese ravioli with tomato sauce and anchovie
Spoiled, ah shit, my blood boiled
But fuck that, I'm ready for open hand combat
It's the tomcat, and my thoughts are unlimited
Inflicted fatal wounds and I'm immune, see a evil society

Science of 25 thousand year millennium
The sinners from the men who exiled the Indians from India
Who's times can't be measured linear
In all tribes on Earth who can't find a friendlier group of people 
who shunt all evil, treat all men equal 
Even though we see through your wicked intentions
We gave you land to experiment with your inventions
But you strive for global lynchin', extension
But it's yourself that will become extinct
You inherit this power to think and build things
The free wills of love, not hate or kill things
And when you went astray, we sent prophets to reveal things
And left scriptures behind to fulfill things
But you still want to kill things, rob and steal things
So don't blame us when it's time to fulfill things and kill Kings

Inside the womb seven months before the Queen found me
Up in wroughty Brownsville with fiends around me
Now roam gat in Staten with cream team around me

They called me Bobby, cousin, really got the black Harley
Taught his son how to spike cats like Lee Harvey
Oswald, all's well that ends well
My big brother Divine, he pushed the Benz well

I got the cherry Range, broke and rockin' heavy chains
I'm from the tribe of men who would bury Kings
On the back of the A-train, my daydream
Should I make a phat hit or should I take cream?

From the Clan that taught you Cash Rules
I make soul grind tracks, you grab ass too
Give respect to the Prince when he pass through
Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe

Cousin Billy, known to strap the black Uzi
Two-two in front of the Jakes like Jack Ruby

Through the phone I heard the bangin' sounds
In the background, layin' down
I'm spittin' what the people missin'
We extreme with the murder type theme
Don't sleep, get ya head split to the white meat

Big guns, down South we blaze
Shippin' bodies back up North, it's the Weston
Wild Texan, no trespassin'
Long mics hit the dead arm
Planet Earth, home of Islam

Brooklyn, I was physically born, clothes torn
Rough tacklin' the streets, Allah Math' spine Technics
We bring heat to the block party, drinkin' Bacardi
Baggin' shorties for the homies who ain't here

He was snuffed, black, his little cousin Moe stuck Cap
That's Miss. Sommers on the bike with the gat like, ""Fuck that""

Cracked a cold beer then bust a shot in the air

You ain't been in these projects in a while

Don't think these young bucks won't lay you down like tile

And chase you out the hood, in a bloody hood

Yeah, I mean that nigga, clap happy Cali, clap when he 'ttack
Most get astounded by surrounded sound effects in the back

Cats sacky in Com stack, retire from the crack
I'm askin' Allah that the warm Hennessey help me
I ain't chose the struggle, the struggle chose me
Lord forgive me for I have stolen from my brothers
Snaked my brothers, even killed my brothers

Familiar fish scale, everybody plays the fool

The younger God's givin' me tools
Solomon Allah, I feel I was jerked
To the drug dealers, my baby mother's a flirt
Holey socks, one fatigue suit, what you feel it don't hurt?

That's my problem now, I ain't afraid to talk
Still cop coke from the well Willy

'Til he forced me to hit him with the nine milli'

Puffin' all that trash, you best to see so"", so
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, ""I like that""
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that

I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name, I said, ""Say mine back""

I need your attention now kids
Due to the recent events that have occurred
Effective immediately, all classes are suspended
Until further notice

[Remedy]
Black and white notebooks and ball-point pens
The first day of school, might make some new friends
From the 103, dreams to me was a Benz
Or the 3 o'clock bell that sounds when school ends

Lunch room status, we used to roll dice
Bang beats on the tables to see who was nice
Swore we knew it all, didn't want no advice
How unfortunate, some paid the ultimate price

We used to cut class all day, roam around the hallways
With little wooden passes
I remember 6th grade, assembly, shirt with tie
The young little Remedy, wonderin why

I did what I was told to get to junior high
'cause at that point in time I believed I could fly
Big blue binders, young designer finders
Livin' in the world with no rules, high school

Language arts, I sat and wrote darts
My mind ran wild and free like +Young Hearts+
Mathematics, where I based my foundation
Fall to the nation on wack Education

We don't need no Education
We don't need no thought control

Yo, yo, sit in the back of the class with my hand up
2 wild security guards just grabbed my man up (HEY!)
Threw him in detention for 5 days suspension
'cause sunset, the teacher was lyin about the Indians
Tryin to tell much of the story of Columbus
Tryin to brain-numb us, when all you see, that came from us
They copy-carvin, I learned about Gods and
Taggin Wu logos on the corner in my book margin
Phat shoe laces and tri-colored sneakers
I stood up like a man then I questioned the teacher
""How did Europeans black out in dark ages?
And when it got light did they white-wash the pages?
Why is it average college kids stuck with low wages?
You wonder why these students walk around with 12 gauges?""
Intense like a New York riot, she stood quiet
And said, ""Mr. Diggs, may I please speak to you in private?""

""Put away your things, pop quiz""
Yo who he thing he is though messin with them kids?
All he ever did in my 9 to 3 bid yo
We don't really need no, won't you let us live
Misinformation straight from the board of education
Percential government issue number 2 pencils
Scantron sheets, gettin mark incompletes
Yo, ""Keep still"", ""Get up on the wall"", ""Fire drill""
Routine line-up, snitch how you do us
Try and fool us with the big yellow school bus
But nonsense, parent/teacher conference
The system's invincible, go see the principal

[Chorus]

[Remedy (Children of the World)]
Put a freeze on the nation, board of Education
(Hey teachers! Leave those kids alone!)
Try and fool us with the big yellow school bus

Diploma or not, got to use what you got

And little freckles on her complexion 
Chief of the Yakusa 
But she's wicked like Medusa 
And she got Crazy 88 killers

Quick to chop a head off 
Then wipe the blood off

Never let a dud off 
You got a minute to pray 
And a second to die 
You could see the image of the devil reflectin inside her eye 

But since she was a little girl, yo 
She never would cry 
She seen so much tragedy 
Let me explain to you why 

She grew up on a military base 
Where she had to face 
The brutality of her mother and her father being erased 
The blood dried from her teardrops on her cheek 
You seen the smear spots 
She sat, only watched 
As the shogun sliced through her dear pops 
Through his thick skull 
Ya she's vicious, like a pit bull 
And when it comes to hatred and revenge 
She got a shit full 

Revenge is the fire that burns inside your soul 
Ay yo, she been bustin up knee caps son 
Since the age of 11 
But fuckin her enemy to death 
That was her favorite weapon 
And in death you paid in hell 
Boy it can't be paid in heaven 
You better get down on your knees son 
And start prayin to the reverend 
Bon Appetite 
Boy revenge is so sweet 
Especially when it's served on a cold dish 

But she has no wish 
But to cut yo day short 
Like the winter solstice 
And the chance to receive a slight bit of mercy from her was hopeless

RZA,"You know they say
In every man's life, there comes a time
When you get struck by the arrow of cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman
Sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

There is more to love than this
Love is more than just a kiss
Will we take you to that step
Will we do more than just connect
And will you, bring the thunder in my life
And the fire in my eyes
Cause then there, will be days of pleasure and
Everything far will be so near

I have never felt thunder (thunder)
And lighting (lightning) like this

Cuz yo, this right here
Is called Knowledge of Self

Wanna kick the knowledge and pass this information to you?

Yo, yo... don't even call me Bobby no more, man (What I call you?)
My name is Prince Rakeem (Today's Mathematics?)
I see Today's Mathematics is being wisdom
Let me explain to you this way, God, the way I see it

[Chorus]
Ever since my Birth (no one there!)
I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)

They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken
By a brother attemptin' to open
The graves, of these mentally dead slaves
Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin', but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature
By the devil in a genocide caper
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep
But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal
But the men who wrote that, they was evil
Slave owners, who did not include us
They just used us, and abused us
First they trick you, then mentally kill you
And use technologies, to rebuild you
This whole plan was a perfect scam
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil
In the Million square miles of land that he settles
Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery
To speak the truth it takes bravery
And no man could stop my flow
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know

What, becomes of a broken family?
Dreams are crushed and there's no more family

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, as a life can be slowed down 20 frames per second
Seen through Panavision
The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism
A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious
Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors
Who smite with the mighty right hand of God
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title?
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head
Still puzzled like the jigsaw

Heading to the Western Hemisphere, non-stoppin'
Strikin' the belly of the seed to make it vomit

in shapes and form, never been dreamed by men

From insight, my inner-light beams within
Pin-point focus, move silently un-noticed
When you attack, I fall back in the wind like the lotus
Put the soul in the track like my name was Otis

what is truth, what is right and what's not

and yo I will give birth to a light that lives to keep it real
All through research, I learned in schools, not even Church
Can instill, these words are jewels so you can heal
Still I search, and I works real hard, I need a deal

Strapped down, I'd still get my point across

Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes

So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lighting above your head is caused by the Son of Man

That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the fantism
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere

The true joy of love bring a thousand tears

When we used to build at ghetto big wheels
With the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on

The Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet
Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps

See the joy of life beginning
Oh sweet joy!
A brand new baby boy

My mind flashed back to the early moon
When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube
In the mist of a state of triple darkness
Going through a struggle so I could exist
Avoiding everything that came within my path
As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half
One out of a million completes the job
And for the other sperm cells the womb is a grave yard
Though my travels I had to pass through
a lot of battles and violent hassles
Cause inside the womb I was a foreign object
I'm like a new nigga walking through the project
Trouble, everywhere I turn
Damn its a struggle just being a sperm
cell, so I attempt to prevail
I guess the womb is the first stage of hell
Now here I am in the danger zone
My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes
But then again yo it can't be that bad cause my dad
He could have used a body bag
And if so then my tomb would have been the trash can inside my moms bedroom
But they was fucking, they was true to this
And here I go on a mission to the uterus
A million mother fuckers tried to race ahead
But I was the one that fertilized the egg
Then I thought then I was safe
Because I reached home base
But oh no my job wasn't done
In fact my troubles had only begun life as a struggle
Life is the struggle
Life is the struggle

See the joy of life beginning

I'm at Radio 1 just doin' my thing tonight

And just walked into this studio some of the hottest UK cats out there


My man Skinnyman {Woah, woah, Blade 
And Mr. Tibbs what's the deal? What you got for me?

{Yeah we got ya the new banger Tim straight from RZA

Straight from the Wu-Tang





(Yeah representin' live all my UK hip hop heads in the North Side, el tarno)

Down it's gonna bang in ya face, lets go



[Skinnyman (RZA)]

Regardless, I'll be here bringin' it heartless

Ruthless, to the death I'll stand for the truth yes

My God given talent is all that I can do best

Keep spittin' over these tracks and leavin' you blessed

So who requested my time on the set

Skinnyman's what you get, so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet

Ya best upthreat 'cause it gets better yet
I'm that deft intellect, them boy they don't pent


So who requested Wu-Tang on the set (it's the RZA)

What you get so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet

We'll never let anybody else step

Or ever come with anything less for what you'd expect

If you pass me the mic then I'll gladly accept

I'll take it to the street, show you how rough it can get

'cause everybody knows this rappin' thing isn't happenin'

Now they jack it in and go back to shottin' crack again

Locked down the block and get strapped with the gat again

Then we break it down then just deal with the matter then

So how you'd think a British ghetto youth feels

He can't get a record deal but he can get drugs to deal

He can't get a job but he can go for rob and steel

Lookin' for a mill' while you screamin' ""keep it real!""

So I'll just stand here with this mic that I hold

Request the higher force to sweep over my soul

So I can fulfill my dream, go for my goals

I'm sick of spendin' every late night out of role

Explosive, leavin' nuttin' but rubber with a spinback
Snap a photo with your camera, capture the stamina


Hand it to a amateur, show him how to damage a
Live set, make him feel the full effect


And yet still make it hard to detect and what's left?

Four men remain standin' like Gladiators

When the dusk clears nuttin' for the average ears

For years its been the same with minds of the artillery

God forgave us all for the merciless delivery

Holdin' the tools of the trade with a death grip

Rememberin' the times when nothin' was right, we was desperate

Dreams blown to smithereens, turned into nightmares with screams

There's a world of CREAM
If all goes correct we can stash supreme


Feed the fiend 'cause that's the way it was meant to have been
You should of seen the comin', the language is universal


One time perfect attack with no rehearsal

Shook the Earth for what it's worth

You're in danger of a takeover, and it's analysed as global

We can find them whatever your predictions

Enterin' the realm unknown with no restricitons

It might be hard to believe
We invade, we conquer and lead

'cause even though it's fuck free, it's all about the paper

I love to live expensive, smoke like I'm in Jamiaca

Even when I'm broke I think I'm like but a creater

Avoids the green, even from my early teens

???????? in need of CREAM seen (seen)


But then I had a dream 'bout bein' the best rapper
But that ain't what it seems, next chapter

That's spreadin' the word

Inspiration from the hurb is what you hear when I got heard

I sat back and observed most of the men that shined before me

All that respect, keeper know 'nough of them will bore me

Singin' the same story, I'm better than you

And to tell you the truth most of them men are shut fools

We asked them in the struggle to make ends meet

That's why I told these MCs that talk is cheap

You might think you know Tibbs, you don't know me

Unless you walk my streets and talk to my peeps

Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing



[RZA]

With your high pitched face like eye liner

If the black gat bust you get struck by the side winder

You can't block and stop it when I spotted

I shoot like Luke Skywalker inside the cockpit
Aimin' at the top fighter


Who I mighta have thirty thousand kids spark the lighter


And set flames to the sky, we aim high
The baseline kick like the kid from Shang-Hi

Make your bubble bust, cuddle up from the rubble thrust

You'se will have the double juice duck, then I doubled up

To the double four, puddles pour from ya bum bot

Open swords can't be cured by the blood clot
Ya bum bastards, son I come classic

Frame won't last the length of my matchstick


Drunk off the Hennessey V.S. stop the B.S.

I'm still off to catch the CREAM like P.S.

Jake was makin' that green
People always say what the hell does that mean

I'ma turn my aim up, cause I spit overseas now
My head's supplece now, got a new rease now
I've been local, but my rep's gonna increase now
Prevent that, find ya self in a tight squeeze now
I really feel, we all need some hip-hop police now
It's all about see's now, too many MC's now
Please now listen, I'm takin somebodys place
Fuck who that be, ya'all cats can't hold it like me
Though I'm not from no famous, borough or state
I've spent years in this shit, more than eight
I'm more than great, I cross more borders than weight
I serve you 24/7, ya'all can order this shit late
And choose the language too, just go ahead
You want norwegian or the spanish row instead
Toma, para los que pueren entender (Spanish)
Til de som stÃ¥r og ler, vi fÃ¥r bent dem ner (norwegian)
(=For those who are standin there laughin, we bend them down)
Nei(=no), I can't compare, ya'all shit this hot
Ya'll can't flow like Diaz, or make peace like RZA

Ta ra ratta Ta ra ra ratta
Yo, yo
We like to get, get high
Chase ????, chop
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

[Diaz]
Heard ya'all Mc's talk a lot, let's get back to this
I don't know if ya know this, but ya facts are twist
Up and coming motherfuckers just act as if
What they need to learn about is what practice is
Ya'all should get a teacher, who you lack is Chris
It be funny to see how you react to this
I'm like that +Activist+, I run up with bombs
While screamin 'fuck rap', with see-4 in both palms
I keep spittin after I blew off both arms
RZA came through, I'm used to flow over tarms
Beef that is, I'm tryin to reach these kids
Go head to head with these labels, beat their bids
Do whatever it taes, I never shit slide
Bout to switch on they ass like Jekyll to Hyde
Nobody takes me for a ride, put it to side
That's not an option, time for me to go outside
Hard to knock loose, cool with that much pride
God's my witness, I don't got too much to hide
That wasent the truth, Virgin Mary would I cry?
Peeped it with closed gates and I've would've fried

[Chorus]

We like to get, get high
Smoke, smoke, lah, lah
Trees, and feel the breeze
Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

I might, get my, my big, big G-A-T
And start the squeeze, 16 shots at you crab MC'z

Nigga, we can get high, high
Chase ????, chop
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

I might get, get my, my big
And squeeze 16 at you ????? rappers wanna touch my team

Nigga, we smoke, smoke lah, lah
Can, can get, get high
Ski, feel the breeze
Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea

Not those brothers Tony, wanted to pop me in that movie
Now I'ma claim that name, Diaz, y'all can sue me

Flamed from the heat I squeeze, feel the adrenaline

Magnetic attraction to wizzes keep their coochie wet
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I'm a super-nova
Controller of the lunar and polar, German luger holders
Best to back the fuck up, my mag buckin' up
The slugs could stop Mack trucks so don't act up
Fatal guillotine carrier blast like the space harrier
Sip of the blackberry, Berry I might marry ya

[Diaz]
There's a lot of shit that separates y'all from me
I'm in touch with the streets, they reply to me
If I'm needed by my people there's no why in me
A real fighter, maybe there's a young Sly in me
I'm like that Spanish Rocky, attitude a bit cocky
Me around ya girl, y'all could guess where that cock be
Well it's not in my pants, not in my hands
Y'all could look at it like, I make her hot in advance

Jag ser ett finger I ett publikhav

drar in cash varje kväll
ständigt aktuell 100 decibel, debil, ikväll
gå på scen I ett svart klädesställ
jag är som en grogg utan virke, bara ren jävla stil
jag är som en hundra formel ett, fast I en jävla bil

This is Ghostface Bakery, ya'll ain't cake to me
Pushin' cocaine, Whitehorse in the city
Over Pun and Pac, I cried over Biggie
Spazzed out, grab a white bitch by her titties

Rock wallabies, this is Clarkology
You know copy Starky belong wit the triple technology
Quick wit the pistol, leave you cripple if you lyin', be
Tickle the butter soft nipples on the side of me

So muthafucka, let me slow that flow down
And bang an ol' mighty hammer like Joe Brown
Dust off rounds, surround sound, trey pound
Put a phat leather head to bed like night gowns

If ya'll wit me then build, shorty, brothers is real
We true dons, makin' glass on the cash is on
Get my head right and smash yours moms, kid
So chose me, the bitch greased my palms

I'm comin' from Paris city
I'm on the residence, so don't shit on me
Like cool G. rap I got the Ill Street Blues
You lose, you can rich them out of my shoes

Baby, me and my Crew, we comin' your way
Saian Supa do it everyday, all day everyday, all da
Don't fight, don't fight, just see the light, see the light
Wit the sound, RZA will make it all right

Grey Goose wit cranberry
The raspberry bikini on honey wit the black berry
Had my eyes bulgin', plus my pants bulgin'
Ready for indulgence, long stroke compulsions

I'm lookin' for devotion, slow motion
Tropical potions, Sun and body lotions
Sex on the ocean, nine inch explosions
Had me frozen like the icicle
Big legs like she ride bicycle

Shorty beefcake known to make my knees shake
Sweepstakes, first day at the cheesecake
Factory, Tony Starks in back of me
Sippin' on pina coladas, twistin' Daquiris
The gold lion is known to hold iron
Rings stuffed with diamonds, Bobby and Supa Saian

Saian, move it on your left
Saian, bring da muthafuckin' ruckus
See'est l'Saian, Saian, Saian, Supa

Je vaut mille Rocky au mic jusqu'à Milwaukee
J'lache do lest donc j'attends qu'on me lache de l'estime
Voici l'homme de l'est avec sa dream team
Tisse sa toile comme Lady Laystee autour des wistitis

Pas de mc de bas niveau, v'là do nouveau
Fout tout le reste dans le caniveau
Bousille pas ton cerveau car les ondes sont gravés
Et tu décale ta sono, abattez mes rivaux

Et t'as peur de rencontrer le reste do commando
Ensemble ou en solo
KLR nous unis, veille sur nous depuis là haut

J'débarque sur le projet, j'te baise ou j'grave
Écartes ton gros der, tes grosses fesses
Ramènes tes grosses lèvres, j'te le donne en conseil
Pas des grosses mères, des grosses maîtres

À l'aise poses ta grosse tête
Pas de proverbe mais ne cause
Pas trop prenne de gros projets

J'sais qui va are'tentir avant d'repentir lors do dernier round
Un sac de croix sur l'dos j'affronte
Ces foudres prêt à en découdre
Tout blanc vêtu, moi le sale noir, l'esprit nue
Seul sur le ring sous le sol spacial, entends la cloche fatale
Quand les anges ont la dale, see'est mieux qu'un blanc qui sale

Ca fait un bail que j'danse avec l'espoir
Faut que j'sorte do bétail où j'traine ma vie animale
Outre les raisons, seul dans les choix et actions
Et trop de souvenirs en tête, est-je pris les bonnes décisions?
See'est dans la pulsion souvent qu'jai choisi la friction

Mais bon Franchement ya des cons sur
Terre qui méritent sanction
Et tout ce que j'aurais pu dire et faire, ouais je sais j'espère
Veinement qu'les impairs why'a que moi qui va devoir les payer

Et j'ai bien essayer, tu peux me rayer d'ta liste si ça t'plais
Et si tu laisses en fait les mêmes parfaits
Ton peuple il va faire les jetés
Ni l'moins bon, ni l'meilleur vécu à cent à l'heure
La peur sur le front

Le coeur qui fait front comme mon père le fit
L'Nez collé à l'envie, j'ai fais ce qui fallait
J'te le dis en face, see'était ca ou m'affolé

On peut pas toute sa vie cavaler au campement
Rémy désolé, je suis see'que j'ai fais
Et si see'est pas see'qui fallait
Seigneur fallait pas m'provoquer

Hey hey, seul face à lui
Dans la vie à la mort, on s'donne
Pas de fausses tonnes
Tout s'échelonne pour finir quand l'heure sonne
La grâce reste le prêt, see'est pas le souci dans la zone

Je sais d'où vienne mes chromosomes
Devant la question éternelle d'lhomme Qui nous sommes?
Dis leur qu'on est le peuple d'celui qui a croqué la pomme
On finira par un décompte
Au delà d'l'univers et ca le monde le sait
Là où la vie est cadenassée, Père

On sera seul face à lui

Bow down to your creator

Tout seul face à lui
Put your wicked heart on the scale
You melt like a snow flake in hell

Seul face à lui
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No disgiue, no alibis and no lies
Tout seul face à lui
You realize every breath you took
It came from the most High

Ma première clope, j'lai fumé en traitre
D'une traite, dans une punèbre
J'ai même pas aimé, quelle merde
Pourquoi j'lai fais? je l'ignore

Faut qu'ca serve comme être célèbre
Putain, tu crois pas que see'tait mieux être bon élève?
Avec une crève deux ans dans les dortoirs
Premier coeur j'crèvre

Histoire comme les autres, brève
Debout dans les piqués de grève
À cette époque ma mère vit ses rêves
Le syndicat est puissant et à la une des prèves
Et après quoi? Ils se sont tous taillés comme des lâches
Se sont couvert de la misère dans les flashs

Maman are'viens sur Terre
Ici merde see'est chacun sa ganache
Excuses moi pour ma scolarité à l'arrache
Accroches mon coeur dans l'cadre
Et mon are'gard sévère s'évade

Comme Jules se tire dans le back dans monade et sérade
La vie see'est grave me laisse indifférent, maintenant cest grave
Dans un arbre prosse l'ail nos initiales s'gravent
Mes amours, see'est ma main que j'tends
Attrapez la sans dire non, on perd déjà trop d'temps

On joue tous les mêmes scènes, les mêmes peines
Restez fort quand les difficultés d'te voir caller
Crie ou implore
See'est comme un implant qui tient l'bon chemin de haut
Alors que rien se tient, seul l'instein pousse nos limites

Excuse, why'en a pas mal qui imite
Chacun son sort, chacun ses rites
Chacun sa cause, fuck les antisémites
Je dois rien à personne à part au Seigneur
Et see'qu'il emporte, faut l'gérer

Chaque cellule grise part pas
Mais pour être jugé dans c'monde
Pourtant j'rêve de liberté dans c'monde
Ceux qui dirigent, see'est la minorité
Les femmes qui aiment faire ce spécial
Pour les deux pour, crient trop
Là-bas why'aura pas d'blancs ni d'negros

Caro RZA qui la storia è tesa
Potersi esprimere sta diventando un'impresa, o meglio
Poterlo fare liberi da vincoli politici
Senza assecondare orrendi gusti estetici

Appena fuori standard ti senti solo dire
Di essere troppo all'avanguardia e quindi incollocabile
Fuori tempo minimo per essere comprensibile
Condannato alla gavetta eterna a raccattare briciole

Per semplice che sia RZA mio, credimi
Sono anni che va avanti questo gioco degli screditi
Dei titoli assegnati senza meriti
Da chi il fischio d'arbitro la vinto ad una lottery

Troppi incompetenti nelle posizioni cardine
Troppe le barriere che si alzano ad un ordine
Troppi quei sorrisi a mascherare I modi barbari
Troppe le energie necessarie ad esser liberi

Istigati dall'istinto
Si insinuano negli intestini
Artistici di direttori stitici
Avanzano con moti di rivolta peristaltici

Risalgono alla volta dello stomaco
Altamente indigeribili si insediano
Aprendo ulcere profonde come gole
Urlandoci parole fino a farle traboccare

Volando in un conato salvatore
A metà della riunione
Ma dimmi, ti pare giusto RZA?
Che si debba fare questa cosa
Ogni volta che uno si riposa?
Dopo aver provato a dare il meglio

Dopo avere fatto un altro figlio
Vederselo strappare da chirurghi
Dilettanti allo sbaraglio
Che se commettono uno sbaglio capita
Fanno una modifica e il tempo si decapita
Non versano una lacrima, bacio all'anima
Avanti il prossimo

Tryna dip, on this twenty dollar bill I had on my dashboard
And police is asking me son, why I whoop his ass for
Save y'all two hours of paperwork, my neighbor lurk
Watchdog, chew ass out, son, and put in major work
We collect antique ammunition's, and plus
We got them big guns, you only see in science fictions
My Uncle Cuffie's the chief, but my little, knucklehead
Cousin Mar', yeah, son, is a thief
And we gave him a job, making three hundred a week
But he slipped on my piece, now he's back in the streets

[Chorus]
How many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips
I never heard such nerve before
But you better spill slowly through the cracks of my pores
Just to please you honey, just to please you honey
And how many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips

A.G. is King like Tutankhamen or Haile Selassie
Body the party, watchin' for niggas tryin' to Pac me
Or Biggie Smalls me, come on, please

A's loose, so much pain inflicted, remain addicted
Carry microphones, with the Passion of Je-sus
It's Flamboyant for life, nigga, throw those L's up
Ain't millionaires, by this year, then catch us in 12 months
Now who's fuckin' with Andre?
A beast on the east, love on the west, ask Kanye
Still Diggin' motherfucker, it's that plain and simple
G.D. til' my heart beat,discontinue
On the ave., til every soul in the ghetto is gone
Where niggaz sell more rock than heavy metal songs
Anything you want to know, then read E2K
Fuck with A, and get broke up like B2K, cause

[Chorus]

Aiyo, aiyo, 'cause I'm the piece, the magnetic, I'm not the weak and pathetic
Sometimes, inside my rhymes, you hear words that perfected
Master your Hung Gar, five animal form Kung Fu
Thunder the Barbarian sword, being swung
Wu-Tang, invincible blade, thrust to parry
Up the Temple steps, much water got carried
In this industrious world, meet the illustrious
Uncombustional, give props like Doctor Huxtable
Knew many men, only trust a few
Women, love the few, mention Wu-Wear linen, rugged blue
God-you's, I tuck a few, known to smash out a club or two
And represent the worldwide W

[Chorus]

Oh, oh, your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood

Users with U**'s on 'em, you move, you getting spanked
Shank broilers banked, alcoholics ranked ballers

You already know what it is, Division, back in the building
Brooklyn, you see 'em? Haha (yeah, come on) (soldier hold ya sword high)
(Swing it like a Samurai) Who are we?

We them breadwinning baby making, pill popping, liquor sipping
Blunt smoking, gun toting, see how these niggas living
Earn, burning word for ya, curb serving
Got you hooked by the first purchase, birds chirping
Cops listening, with the gun sitting on they lap
'Cause of that, the t-shirt's on the block, like 'stop snitching'
Living by the code of the samurai
Dreams put on hold like operators standing by
What you craft with your heart or your weapon
It's a question, what you craft with, a Glock or a message in a rhyme
I teach you little savage part of a lesson and choice
Between being a gangsta and an artist, is the start of your ending
You can front like you a gangsta artist, but that ain't the smartest
Decision, niggas'll test you
Say you ain't the hardest, regardless, what you spare homey
RZA told me that the game is flipping, nobody bent for me

Haha, you already know what it is
Murda is back in the building
Division, back in the building

Free Murda, dick longer than the O.J. Trial
Have your bitch backstage with the Colgate smile
I'm on the back Glocks where the coke ring loud
Bullets got flat tops like they stole Kane's style
Warm 'em kid, you wanna flow, drain now
Get your whole brain out, where your hoes hang out
It's killing me, everybody got cocaine nail
Stealing Free is like trying take a old stain out
Your boy's on fire, my boat stays out
It's gon' take more than a wire, to close they mouth
Got a slice of that bread, bags that you stole
You had a price on your head, now that tag's on your toe
And you know that nigga dead when the casket is closed
Off with his dreads, keep the mag' in my clothes
I'm trying, real good, the semi' got loud up
You can die in your hood, like Kenny from South Park

How many licks does it take
For me to hit the tootsie roll center of a break?
Yeah, how many hits must you make
Before a man'll get his mule and his forty ac's

RZA,"Yeah, yeah, a special guest appearance
From the slums, yo, aiyo

I examine your diameter, third eye, light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister

Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break, I can't revive

In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four
Five clip, filled with the spiral tip

I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggaz approach me

Like the blind, death, dumb, whose mind was left numb
A non be Boy nigga couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started MC'ing, I entered the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I becoming with too much to measure

With the math of an elder and the steel of a welder
The path of tray that I had laid down and held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope

Supreme deluxe edition, cream with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison

Twenty-two year old, Dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby, moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body now, he stuck in another prison

When you see it, you better acknowledge your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours, pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw

Why try to fuck with these lecturers?
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. family and more one

They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land

He blew out the belt drive, MC's they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation

But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn

Them, Clansmen are the nucleus of hiphop
There's no room for error, M see's will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser

The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone

The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces and driven back

It is very dangerous to make a raid
With the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack",Advance Pawns,2007
RZA,"You know they say
In every man's life, there comes a time
When you get struck by the arrow of cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman
Sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

There is more to love than this
Love is more than just a kiss
Will we take you to that step
Will we do more than just connect
And will you, bring the thunder in my life
And the fire in my eyes
Cause then there, will be days of pleasure and

It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin' sess drinkin' beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected, for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart

I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink

I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound

Might show up, stun 'em and run 'em when they raggin'
Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Tryin' to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoked out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad fly, flew south for the (winter)
Hey, enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare
I'm goin' to the country, I'm goin' to the fair
To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, cause she love me long time
Bartender bring more wine
Get in line for the

I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier
The hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
you battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got
Going to war with the melting pot hot

It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth
Moving on your left, ah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame, my style'll live forever
Niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""sue""
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
I mean oh, you check out the flow
like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dusting
Niggaz off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me [cough]

First things first man you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!

For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

I smoke the feet of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, Ya head, get shrunk

Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church
I come like a thousand doves

Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze

Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it

Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souflee saute for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A, Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessee by the jig
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof, Absolut, mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got yo' neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus, when the whole world need us

 must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
 Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
 Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

I'm the Osirus of this shit

It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God

Shoot out the speakers when my guns get Jurassic

Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself

Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee

Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall

The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
Are-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to snuggle you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little rock'll turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge

[Masta Killa]
Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is MC'ing at it's best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul to war us, be the growlest
Asiatic arctic flow is so frigid

[RZA]
Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Wu, so coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distressed like the damsal, lost like little Hansel
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Gold-plated desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the neighbor yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being took and operated
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, ark, who goes there?
Power-you smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Ain't nothing but bones, we plotted the sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
See-Cypher Pigs, can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a click that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic

I can't believe they took my wife and my kids, it's straight Lester
Word to God, once I get em, I got em, the moments priceless
Decapitating heads like a journalist snatched with isis
I want revenge now!
Spotted one of Delucas men, at a restaurant
Eating spaghetti, drinking on Dom Pérignon
With two other goons laughing, probably joking bout the murder
I calmly approach them with the burner
When they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em
60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains
Now it's total chaos, the people running for they lives
The other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers
But they was slow on their draw so I blammed em
Taking they tops off like convertible dry burgundy phantom
They say the taste revenge is sweet, well let me see
Prepare the table for a feast, take a seat, and let's eat

In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavash

Beast mode, I'm resurrected, I hear the record spinning
Early 70s, New York [?]
And I see street life, the only life I know
I see Liberty, I see the motherfucking Verrazanos
I see gangstas getting money, bitches acting funny
Stacks upon stacks, and not one nigga bummy
Something ain't right, these ain't the greedy streets of Italy
Where Logan and my seed? C'mon son, you kidding me?
Who's calling me? Who's looking for the killer with no face?
Who summoned me into this place? I need answers!
Behave chancellors, I'm a vigilante killer
No time for games and there ain't no nigga realer

She can ride off the lot at the drop of a dime

I cop that shit overseas on tours
No makeup, when she wake up
Sweatpants and the fat ass, boxed braids, watch where she laced up

And a bed that led to a cemetery
Yeah, shorty had my nature going naughty
I was hard as a flicker, shes iPhone record me
Put on iCloud, let TMZ report me
Oh, what a girl, what a world she bought me
When our lips touch, she like cig puffs
Bustin' like a rocket to the moon or bust
This is past, past the nation, past infatuation
This just like she was my soul aspiration
She's the type who likes sex over masturbation

Let me embrace that
Holding you captive
You're so attractive
So let me taste that
And beat it up real good until you say cat
You're not a hood rap

Continuing like Buck Rodgers
In the twenty-first century
And we still gotta duck the coppers
On a seaport in Newport beach
I see military air carriers on the shores
They had a whole fleet
Of weapons of mass destruction with mass production
Of war machines that function to secure this world corruption

More tweets than a blogger
They perform acts of violence
Like they tryna win a Oscar
From El Salvador to Nicaragua
And Detroit to Divine City

To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning

With their shields and their swords

To overthrow the overlords.

They brought plunder, swords and flame

And the children would never play again.

Above the battle cry
By the bridge near the border

By every consequence

The ones I have had to leave behind

The woman who depended on you
To sing a little praise or criticize, oh no

So I hide it, divide it

See things in black and white
I've only got you inside my mind
You know you have made me blind

I lie awake and pray
That you will look my way
I have all this longing in my heart
I knew it right from the start

Oh my pretty pretty boy I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before you
Pretty pretty boy of mine
Just tell me you love me too
Oh my pretty pretty boy I need you
Oh my pretty pretty boy I do
Let me inside
And make me stay right beside you

I used to write your name
And put it in a frame
And sometimes I think I hear you call
Right through my bedroom wall
You stay a little while
And touch me with your smile
And what can I say to make you mine
To reach out for you in time

Oh my pretty pretty boy I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before
Pretty pretty boy of mine
Just tell me you love me too
Oh my pretty pretty boy I need you
Oh my pretty pretty boy I do
Let me inside
And make me stay right beside you

Oh pretty boy
Say you love me too

Oh my pretty pretty boy I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before you
Pretty pretty boy of mine
Just tell me you love me too
Oh my pretty pretty boy I need you
Oh my pretty pretty boy I do
Let me inside
And make me stay right beside you

S&S,"* originally appeared on the Rush Hour soundtrack

Intro: (DJ S&S), Slick Rick

(Uhh check it out..... S&S......
with the ruler '98........Def Jam.....)
And here we are, in the phase again
That ol' funeral music, is he goin to heaven or is he goin to hell?
I don't know, he's right in the centre, why'knowhutImean? (Uhh uhh)
(Uhh-huh huh, uhh-huh huh, uhh-huh huh, uhh-huh c'mon
Uhh-huh yeah, uhh-huh c'mon, uhh-huh '98 c'mon.....)

Verse One:

Nigga no way rap better than, act better, that 
veteran of rap *?ceteran?*
Brung on, motherfucker sung on, run on
Come on, go and have fun on, run on
Immediate considered, no he really ain't
The main ingredient, comedian, must be obedient
Reason why the player who away a few, say that too
'cause no one else can talk shit way I do
School kid, the cool slid
and I rule wid, still shoot wid my 2, kid
Ain't no way on Earth to faze Rick, the man plays with wit
Eras-ed the man amazin the bassin
Border him, all on ya albums slaughterin
Better spin like slavery when I order him
Rejects creep yet keep step
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Chorus:

Mack all of it, controller shit, catch hold of it
How you gonna move Slick when cats like solo Rick?
Accept, yet no chances that they make plans
to wreck and make a nigga, breakdance the record
I turned and learned this sequel I burned went
urgent, mad white people like servin
Interested with, gets congested with
clowns, haven't made a record, impress the kid

Verse Two:

No entry, let's keep a hood rhymin shit (A-party people)
Are you tryin to have yourself a good time or what?
No stressin you, type of beat bring out the best in you
Allegeble, ruler came to add a touch of bless onto
Niggas think they bashin me, his majesty
of garbage and never were no match for me and actually
many a girl catch the fever
and I don't need anyone else rap with either
If this is based on skill, kill anybody will
affiliate Rick real to Hicksville
Same ruler movin cowardness out of this
Never out powerless, devour this and now it is
time for one to leave upon impeach
Help teach all men how to live amongst each (KnowI'msayin?)
Although a lotta creep yet keeps
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Chorus

Verse Three:

The bounce men, S&S sound bend
Listen up kid, an important announcement
There's a rapper I know many interested in
named Rick, no rapper alive could mess with him
Lace records all audience roar to
Grand of a show, skill on the dancefloor too
Freakin awesome, of course I'm married
High school broads keep your drawers on
'cause this one in perf' case
Guaranteed to make you break fool at the work place
Diligent, shout as Mr. Militant
Allow me to do my thing, it's all brilliant
Although sometime the reign may slip
can't skip my part on the hu-man tip
Ain't shit, you rejects creep yet keep step
Every borough, every state, every country in deep check

Chorus

Outro: DJ S&S

Slick Rick and S&S now, c'mon

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare

Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""

Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking

Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen

[Lil Wayne]
And the name be fire Wayne, ice and change
You can catch me in an aqua range, squattin things
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades
Diamond face, diamond brace
More colors than the game Simon Says
Go, 'hind me
And mami on forty-fifth she told me ""I'm a lez""
And she ain't like too much of dick 
but give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got family, don't need your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin
All these karats like I'm a fuckin vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, why'all already knowin
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin
See I'm a keep it goin, Big Tymin, you heard's me?
Dog I got cake like everyday my birthday
Wait, don't think they heard me
I say dog I got cake like everyday my birthday

[Chorus]
[B.G.]
I'ma Hot Boy, that's name brand and top of the line
Ride fly daily, all year 'round I shine
Ain't a nigga and they mama gonna stop me dog
Come through on dub-dueces, they jock me dog
Glock cocked for haters tryna block me dog
Catch 'em so low, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way
And let B.G. ease down the shinin linen
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't want to put your vehicle next to us
'Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up
With television, Dreamcast, DVDs
Nice sounds, buttons, it's twenties
I'm a Cash Money Hot Big Tymer nigga
That'll hold a pinky finger up and blind ya nigga

[Chorus]
[Turk]
I'm a stunt 'til I die, so you better respect it
Cause whoever try testin is gonna be restin
I'm a young millionaire, Hot Boy, Lil' Turk
Bling blingin everyday, plus I got work (bling)
Nigga like me stay in the cut twenty-four/seven
Steady stackin my ends on dubs, twenty-four/seven
Every car you wish you had, we got it, we got it
Bentleys, Hummers and Jags, big bodies, big bodies
Love to floss, no secret stun'ner's
Niggas steady baller block, can't take nothin from us
Young nigga, livin a life surrounded by ice
Hoes be like, ""Damn, them boys, they're nothin nice""
They on fire, that must be them Hot Boys
You motherfuckin right, you think this not girl?
Better think twice, get it right dog
Know you recognize, we got it on lock for all

[Chorus] - 2x
[Mannie Fresh]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Huh uh (oh shit)
2001 - my life is the shit, know why?

Trop de fois on s'acharne à se poignarder
Stop la mascarade c'est entre camarade qu'on aime se canarder
Ca va barder, nouveau projet, tu vois qu'on fait des progrès
On veut tenir les objectifs qu'on promet
Mais sans se compromettre, dans le game on se promène
Le geste tu le connais : plus de money, plus de problèmes
On oublis pas ce proverbe, les frères qui le profèrent
Se trainent entre les procès, guette c'est ainsi que l'on procède
Aucun de nous n'est prophète et seul dieu nous protège

I lost a battle here and there
So I stocked my weapons to begin again

Your sharpened arrows pierce my heavy heart
And carry on to bleed me dry
But at least for now I have nothing left for you
And I don't even have to try, have to try

Oh, boy, I'm done

And it's so long now
And I have figured out
That I'm not stronger with than without

Been wasted on your mind

She's back in town, this time we get it on 
She told me she would meet me at my spot at about eight 
That gives me two whole hours to get my shit straight, yeah 
Hit my case about six, it's almost time to see her 
Almost time to get my fix, I just can't wait to see her pretty face 
She's not like all these others on the paper chase

Since you hit town, you had me runnin' round actin' crazy 
Had I known you'd treat me this way 
We'd have to swing the shower so, another day, baby 
This was your night, ringers off, beepers off 
My shit was tight, you blew it baby, word is born 
And after all I've done for you 
You messed around and blew the best thing that ever happened to you, baby

Now don't go and put this all on me 
Since I left town, you've been tryin' to run down 
On every girl you see 
I can't believe you do this to me, ooo, baby 
I know about your friend with the red Benz (say what?) 
Now why you want to go and a play a game you can't win? 
You didn't know she was my best friend (DAMN!)

When I needed money, you lent

I'll be your lover and friend
You did your dirt then I grew it
I stayed there helpin' you through it
I f***ed up too and you knew it

Many times I thought that you blew it
But then you'd always make it right with me
No fight with me, forever kept it tight with me
Sometimes you ditched the fellas 

Just to come and ride with me
Then stripped me down, licked me up, every night with me
You never made me feel I owed you for the deeds that you done
Re-payed you with my loyalty, promised to give you a son

Can't nothin' come between us ever boy
You know you the one
And love I give you everyday, you know it's second to none

So come and get paid with me, runaway with me

Every day with me, n**** stay with me
Anytime you want it, have your way with me

Keep every gat on spit

Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil are-you-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin M-I-see
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book wit my lyrics I'm endin this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin in my ears
Fuckin ejected, he can't hang wit my style
Look now, here's man fillin it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin, I'm not playin
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin, lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'cause I will be sure to end whatever you created

Mentally you can't function
Physically you dead wit the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin, from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin about walkin, to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin about ""Where the two glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do wit my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick wit the mic device""
Drivin off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

Nos vies, un putain de jeu de Monopoly, où on ne jette pas les dés
Combien de mes gens, mes acolytes, ne verront pas l'été?
Insignifiants nous sommes auprès des hautes sphères
Une cagoule, une arme, une banque viendront pourrir l’atmosphère
Le savoir fait les armes, j'te souhaite d'esquiver la crosse
On a cherché le bonheur sans jamais trouver l'accroche
Et quand bien même on l'accuse, mon équipe niera les faits
Chez nous, Peter Pan abuse de l'alcool ou bien des fées
On essaie de se construire un avenir propre mais dans le sale
Chez nous, une mère subsiste, se fait prendre la viande dans le sac
Donnés perdants mais on ne pourra s'y faire
Et qui viendra en guerre repartira en civière
Et puis tu sais, le monde fuit
Et ce même malgré nos efforts
Cherche le soleil en temps de pluie

À ceux qui vendraient des plaquettes
Aux gens perdus qui goute la quête, dur après ça de s'en sortir boy
Avec toute sa tête, parce que ce monde c'est :
Des gosses à la guerre, des femmes que l'on bat
Des nez dans la coke, des sommes qu'on n'a pas
Des rêves à la belle, des foyers à l'appel
Des factures à la pelle, un homme qu'on abat
Une mère sur la piste, noyée dans la tise
Elle vendra son corps pour faire face à la crise
Impossible de pouvoir survivre sans espèce

If you could switch brains, you would, wouldn't you?

My style is Mike, Vince, Earvin
Jordan, Carter, Julius, servin'
MC's at will, I'm trickery, Lou ain't stickin' me
A curve ball, Mark ain't hittin' me

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
Yo, what the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, rapid gunfire destroy ya boys and unemploy some
Put the headphones on your kid like Castor Troy's son
Darts'll damage ya dogs where the you-Haul in my truck
The camera installed, hand upon my balls

Call the morgue, I'm killin' 'em, even Kyle is not feelin' 'em
When I drill 'em with skills of ten Eminems
You feminine, don't even call my name
I stay locked down walkin' with a ball and chain

Put the mac where you tongue at, I done that
These young cats'll get thumbtacked and sent where Big Pun at
Smoke so much, the doc asked where my lung at
I took it out to stash my gun, son run that

Pop mega shit, I pop mega clips
Fuck a system, I keep the heat where your Sega sit
Then I bang the controller 'til the game say, ""Over""
In the Bricks, we'll stick ya when ya plane lays over

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, y'all know me, maniacs and addicts add it, at it
Venomous addict snake biter, I the, at it
'Cause I'm a little odder at it
In the Ac' with the aircraft and then leave inactive

My alter-ego make niggaz alter their egos
I flow and turn the East coast to one big creep show
South premisy, Filthy-delphia pistol bangers
Pistol changin', pistol bangin'

I lift metal like Lithuanians
Two thousand nail me Sy Scott rap's new insanian
It's humane, punish ya mayn
'Til no skeletal remains remain remain mainly main

To bitten man made disease that's made by man
Crackin' the DNA code to see how God made man
I storm the mainland, scare MC's like slave hands
Put microchips in they wristbands and make 'em rain dance

Lay hands like Mike Strahand
Puttin' ya face and hands in Ace bands
Tryin' to lift more than ya waistband

I travel every shinin' sea, sea and land to finally see
When niggaz land in the error era wherever, forever no error
Easily cut niggaz careers down like ever
Ever forever and ever, don't you ever
Fuck with Sy, Khi and Erick when we come together, what?
