Let's Eat Grandma,"And just when we discover that we need each other
Here, our lives keep pulling us away
Now we're both so unstable at the kitchen table
With these peanut bagels in a foreign state

Because the point is that I see it's not just me
The point is that you feel my company
I don't wanna say goodbye
Guess I'll see you when my screen is vibrating

It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me

Back then, I'd just decided I was so misguided
That you'd all forget about me, in time
Bet you remember it was New Year's Eve
Sparklers through Palaced streets
We knew though years do change
We'd always feel the same

Because the point is that I see it's not just me
The point is that you feel my company
You know I'll never be too far if you're looking for somebody
I'm here

It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me

Seems so hard you’ll start to feel so
Good at not sweeping it under the carpet
It seems so hard you'll start to feel so
Good at not sweeping it under the carpet
I know when you know

It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me
I know you're feeling the same way
And I can't fail to believe
When you're feeling the same way
It's not just me",It's Not Just Me,2018
Let's Go Sailing,"Don't worry I can't run that fast
My legs can't carry the rest of me that far
Don't worry you'll still be able to place me
To place me
You point your finger right on me

And all I want from you is love.",All I Want from You Is Love,2006
Let's Go Sailing,"Don't get so excited
You're likely to hurt yourself.
You're head looks disproportionate
From pushing too hard to believe

You're not wrong,
Just better off thinking it was only love.

It hurts like a splinter stuck in your foot
And you've tried, but can't get it out.
And of course, you walk in the heat for miles.
You forget the pain, but it comes back after a while.

You're not wrong,
Just better off thinking it was only love.
You're not wrong,
Just better off thinking it was only love, it was only love.

You're not wrong,
Just better off thinking it was only love.

Let's Go Sailing,"Come home safely tonight.
Walk only where you see your shadow
Lit up like a little cloud.
Come home safely tonight.
I will not sleep until I hear you counting steps.
We still have time left, don’t we now?
Don’t we now?

Come home safely tonight.
My heart has fallen over cracks in pavement.
Please come home safely tonight.
This cannot be our last kiss goodbye
Or time your nose is met with mine.
Not this time. Not this time.",Come Home Safely,2007
Let's Go Sailing,"This heart condition that you have 
Is not all its cracked up to be.
Its not bringing you 
The attention that you think it ought to be.
And let us for a moment 
Imagine that this you I'm speaking of is me.

I am worrying that I am falling down 
And this time is different.
My heart has finally stopped beating 
And the world has revealed itself.

But I am winning an imaginary race 
That ends in nowhere.
My heart condition's just acting up 
As I proceed with plans to get there.

Skeletons are underneath the floorboards 
In the boxes that I forgot.
The killer is still on the loose 
I hope they catch 'em fast before he stops my heart.

But I am winning an imaginary race 
That ends in nowhere.
My heart condition's just acting up 
As I proceed with plans to get there.

Motionless I wake up face down, 
Drowning in my bed like a shallow pool.
Air is trapped with words 
I never had the chance to say in elementary school.

And I am winning an imaginary race 
That ends in nowhere.
My heart condition's just acting up 
As I proceed with plans to get there.",Heart Condition,2007

All the icicles falling falling ooh oh

Sticking in the softest spots inside of me

All the icicles falling falling ooh oh
All the icicles falling falling ooh oh
Some clouds came through my window
But after you left I forgot to close
They came in and collected over my bed
I'm swear that I'm telling the truth and
Truth be tell I'm better off dead

Oh ah

As the arctic sun
On my one man island

I’ve been dreaming
I’ve been looking at you

I have to jump.

Let's Go Sailing,"I must be the only one awake.
The windows on my street have all gone dark.
Lying with my back against the wall,

Let's Go Sailing,"Today was a long day
Yesterday seemed shorter
I thought things were going my way
But I guess they got turned around
My heart is the only black pea
The broken rubber band in the bag of good ones.
Could it be there are too many
Stars in the sky?
But I can’t go inside
And leave them behind
But they hurt my eyes.

Today was a dark day
Yesterday seemed brighter
I thought things were going my way
But I guess they found something better
My fingers are like broken matchsticks
And surely my eyes will come to a similar end.
Could it be
There are too many
Fruits on the tree?
And still none

There seems to be a problem.
You have to listen closely.
I can’t change the reception
I thought that there was more to this.
I was wrong
But everybody else still says how well
We get along.
I remember a time when

We weren’t always
Going our own ways.
When we were alone
We were never lonely
We were only apart.

You asked me what was wrong
And then suddenly,
Everything was wrong
But I will still go along with this
So I can say we get along.
Sorry, I said I was sorry.
There seems to be a problem.
You gave me an answer
To a different question.
And I will wait here endlessly to respond.

[Chorus: Letha Face (Autumn Rue)]
I gotta keep it real... for my peeps, it's my destiny
(My life, my life, my life, my life)
I gotta squeeze the steel.. in the streets, you won't get the best of me
Uh-huh, I ain't never gonna stop... never

[Letha Face]
Yo, why this life have to be like this? I hang with the righteous
And bang with a tight fist gripped on the handle
Samples of my product, got fiends lurkin' the block
For them teens murkin' them cops, for death penalties at stake
Shakes scrapped off of porcelein plate, to the last grain
Never make the mistake of givin' my last name
To a woman who blames me for all the problems in her life
I play the wheel of fortune, spinnin' revolvers on my life
My life, is similar to a shooting range, but I'm aimed the target
And everybody's takin' shots at me
I pull up fab', but you was love, but I'm not happy
Ask me what motivates me, I'll tell you my baby son
Now it's back to the slums, where about 80 tons of bricks
Creative a building where I stack my chips
Flip, eject and keep squeezing, to the heat recordings
You disrespected, now you fertiziled trees deep in the soil

[Chorus]

[INF-Black]
Still in the same struggle, many pieces'll make a bundle
Like a jungle, make me wonder sometimes, still gotta hustle
On my grind, seen some furious eyes, some went blind
In the midst of the sunlight, it's like I'm stuck in the times
Hope for better days, gotta get mines, get out this cage
Full of rage on my life, now I express it on stage
Relieve the tension over mics, in the whole first page
My deepest feelings hide inside but always show over my face
A young youth behind the cage, now I'm growin' a fast pace
As I notice, and unfolded the years start to age
Reality'll hit you like a hand held grenade
Give me thanks to my earth, she knew when she made official
Birth of her first son, young gun, .38 special
For my daughter, now, I gotta think before I use the pistol
Wait in temple with today's plan, for tomorrow's issues
Wanna see me in the can? I'm too righteous in the mental

[Chorus]

[Letha Face]
You're never gonna make it in this rap game
My baby mamma cries out, as I'm jiving in the crack came
Swimmin' in fat chains, strapped with the dame
Backstrokin' to the blames of corruption
I'm sucked in the whirlpool of gus bustin' and drug hustlin'
Not for nothin', I need a lifeguard to save me from drowin'
I'm down for men, murderers, who murder murderers
And serve customers with that all night service
Purchase burners at retail, I'm tryin' balance the scale
The streets say the prayers, ya'll be conquered by the prodigal
Got it in hennessey, got my brains in a frenzy
Is sellin' cocaine my destiny, or the best of me?
Secret recipe for my music, I create thunder that shatters
The frame, on your H2 Hummer
I'm a bloodhound at heart, it's in my blood, I live it up
If I could trade this crime life for the music, I'll give it up, what

Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never gonna stop [repeated to end]

I fuck more women than Wilt Chamberlain

I'm titanium, mixed with uranium
Crack craniums, no tamin' him
Live at palladium (yeah), jam packed stadium (yeah)
Many men, you're afraid of him
Once they weighed him in, he flushed money down the drain again
Touched vein again, rocks I'm slangin' 'em
Cops can't finger him, SWAT can't bring him in

I move in silence, and let guns go to my enemies
Bud smoke and Hennessy, the remedy and toke is violent
Much slugs longer than Mini Me
Cross me, I lay down every one in your vicinity
Keep a fifty cali' or line me in the Akademiks jeans
If I catch a homi', somebody probably run and snitched on me
Rats, runnin' round talkin' this and that
Some white chicks I spit til your wigs sit back
I grind these cracks, 'cause I need cash
G stacks, I lay my game down flat like a Chinese ass
You heard me? Bitches want to observe me, learn me
My mission is gettin' Ritz like Jersey, chips for attorney's
Commissary for niggaz that's in the pen thirsty
A big truck, your trick hypnotize by the twirlies
It's Ice, from Shaolin to Crenshaw, dirty
Luv Allah, dump a clip off, at the BX, early

[Letha Face]
Why ... the angels came down and pushed the devil in the dirt
Jerked the memory exist on the iron-on T-shirt
Pythons squeeze til your face turns purple
It's a race to murder you and I'm jumpin' the gun
Dump and run, the long nose cuttin' the soldier's tongue
Your nervous from the burners I'm squeezin'
Without a learner's permit, to carry
The calico stays concealed, if revealead
I must spray this clip through your windshield, it's rea
My whole team reigns supreme, the infrared tech beams
On my next swing, the heavy chain
Deadly but steady aim, I cry ""tears of the sun""
That'll burn the iron hot, as I'm piercin' through your lungs
It's strung by my drug dealer's doses
Ferocious slang that'll bang up your brains in roller coasters
Posters in the background ready to clap rounds
And empty up whole magazines up to the last round

With the mark of the beast, thinkin' you the shit now
Four pound whippin' the flesh, better sit it down
Get it clown? You done started something
I put it down, and you just started hustlin'

You'll get linked in a rumble, you project frontin'

Test your heat when it blaze, better target something
Even my dick iced out, I be hard at fucking
Niggaz need to stop biting and try to market something
Niggaz need to start writing, your bark ain't nothing
Your tracks ain't hot, and your back don't function
Got the rap game locked, the crack game dumping
Got the crime scene hot, the club scene thumping, what?

Would you shoot first? Or get shot?
Or lift the earth from under his feet and make his boots rock

I can't stand it, people try to judge me
Especially the ones that said they love me, try to take me for granted

I could kiss the man who invented the glock
The thermometer pops burger, I stay on cock
So whenever my dogs call me, I'll be there, the end of story
Surrenders gory, close the book after the final chapter
Gradual bullets that travel faster than yacht masters
Hot ratchets that'll spin you, like a spinning top backwards
Cut your cabbage and turn it into coleslaw
I'm so raw, that my mom should of middle named me Diesel
These lethal bars perfected, can't be injected by needles
Breeding eagles out of Park Hill's hell hole
Where souls get sucked up, and shots turn your bones to Jell-o
Mellow tones with a stealth blow, under the bell's a four-four
The impact will crack an elephant's skull

I'm like the hallways you walk through, smokin' a blunt with a brew
The staircase you piss on, gettin' head on the roof
Ride down my elevator, you get punched in the tooth
My alligators hang loose from the front to the phone booth
I'm the concrete, the gates, the bars, gunnin' my goof
I'm the drugs, the money, the booze, and every rules
Fuckin' Betty who? Niggaz is petty, can get it to
Watch your mouth nigga, watch me, watch you
Like a movie, thought it was cool, how you wanted to do me
See me live with the snakes and get rid of them rats
I'm the fire in the lake, I burn faster than a match
But longer in a forest, at the speed of a mach
Spittin' out, bangin' off ground, I'm tearin' it down
There's never no fear in me, and they tellin' what's in me now
I've done tasted the dust, washed my face with the mud
Off with these clowns, my shoes is only made from my blood

Forging notes that never die
The air now rings with dissonant sound
Screaming our last prayer
For this cross that we bare grows much heavier

And die for the things we had hoped for

Poisoning the lips of the newborn in vain

Did I leave my soul behind
I won't go back again
Not till I feel it
Not till I find what's happened to me

For those burning hearts that never die

Father can you heal me
Christ can you ease my pain

Lethal,"Rising resistance decision to abort
Plan of peace in danger
This weight on our shoulders
Much to heavy now to hold
Dreams of high cards
Now have been thrown fold

Near the edge one push and we fall
Dauntless angels seeing no wrong

Scenes from our future
Reflected in the past
Farther in debt to the hour glass
This story we're writing
Much to sad to be told
There is no reason
For this course that we chose

Near the edge one push and we fall

A cold sun is rising
In the mist of poison skies
Our life lines are severed forgotten

Will echo in the night

To a cold nights warning
I've never walked closer
To the edge of the dawning

Could carry me homeward

They knew that I was falling
I'll wash away my sorrows
Down by the river
Put my face in the cold wind
Won't you pray
Oh won't you pray for me

From your disgrace
Why did they discard

Turning in this vicious groove
I have fallen into
My father my government
Forgot me when I was a child
Someday when I am stronger

And open up the door they've closed
I am so afraid of what they've done

From the womb of my dying mother
The blood of her thigh reveals her shame

This scanning and screening my mind
Wasn't born to cry my heart out
Is this the last time we will hear
Our children cry out

Obscure the sky, obscure my eyes
From this world we could not hide
Will this pain we have be shed
Then I know we will make it together

Holding this breath that I stole
From a beam of light I followed
I can't forget the things I've seen

Their dying for freedom in vain
While we all just watch and wonder
Is this the last time we will hear
Our children cry out

Obscure the sky, obscure my eyes
From this world we could not hide
Will this pain we have be shed
Then I know we wil1make it

Once I was born to look in the eyes
Of a world that was calling my name
Now I can't hear
What of these millions
And this pain they must bare
Never to hear, never to see
For their shadows

For breaking the silence they kill
In cold blood that pours down on me
I wear like a crest when I recall

This vision that glows through the night
While I wish that I was dreaming
Is this the last time we will hear
Our children cry out

Obscure the sky, obscure my eyes
From this world we could not hide

When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking (remix ting)

Five plus five is ten, add a quick M, that's my net worth
Every day I drink shocker, get burse

Two twos, now she in the back, no clothes
Hold tight Muttley (my brudda), he's got the flavors
Hold tight Damon (my G), he's got the shavers

I love a full belly, so I live in the kitchen
Now you are what you eat
But I'm far from a chicken
Little mats, big ambition
Far from don and go on mission

Used to get my in little altercations

Rest easily,
In the bed of another man's tired old queen.
I cannot wait for love
If it comes as fast as he did, well, shit
That's two minutes well-spent
That she spent with him

So stay home
In bed alone

All because of you, all because of you,
Now I can't stand it.
In all that I do, all that I do,

Mother, you know I'm sorry,
But sorry's pregnant with remorse
And when remorse is born, remorse won't see
An ounce of child support.

She won't, no, she won't no, she won't.
She won't

Go ahead
No wait
Wait
Ok go ahead

Wait eagerly,
Because tonight I'm another man's brand new queen
Why should I wait for love,
If it comes as fast as he did?

He said, ""Wait, she's with me
So send that other man walking
With his two left feet""
Now I hate my love

And now the other man's floating in the dead man's sea
And he's floating face-down, 'cause he's a dead man, see?

So stay home
In bed alone

All because of you, all because of you,
Now I can't stand it.

Never let a brother play you like you Boo Boo the Fool

With your heart and I hear every word you say
When you cry at night I'll wipe your tears away
In the name of my lord I'll be there right away

I thank God everyday for this opportunity
Just to be able to get up there every mornin'
And I'd never take that for granted
He's blessed me for so many things

I met her like a month ago, South Beach bungalow
We rollin' in that white thang, I'm rolling up one of those
She lookin' like my wife thang, boy I need one of those
Girl it's not a slice thang, ask bout me runnin'
My heart in the trap, got my money on my mind
But when I got you in my lap, we be far from killing time
And they say that opposites attract, but we both on our grind
I love to touch you from the back, tell whats up and never mind

Look up in the sky, it?s a bird, it?s a plane
No, it?s me

'cause I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm

I come through the spot, stun is on the eyes
Fitted to the side, 20?s on the ride
Some say I'm fly, they say I'm the best
Catch me in the sky with the S on my chest

Chicks call me Superman, super duper lover, just in case it rain
Keep the Coup Ville for covers unless it rain dollars
Then your talkin' money, bein' broke ain't a joke
Bein' rich must be funny and me I'm tryin' ta laugh

Count a lil' cash, walk in, walk out
Grab shorty with the a**, take her back to my pad
But no not the crib, I mean the helicopter
Let me show you how I live

See I could take you high, spend a little dough
Shut them all down, take you out them plain clothes
Baby I could make you fly, do it in the day
So tell me if you down, baby what you got to say

She said hold up, wait
Look up in the sky, it?s a bird, it?s a plane
No, it?s me

'cause I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm

Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky, it?s a bird, it?s a plane
No, it?s me

'cause I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm

Now tell me what you like, 'cause I can make it life
Them other n*** did it wrong, see I can make it right
Had ya neck filled with ice, juicy Couture, Velor jumpsuit
Princess for the night, keep ya draped in the best blue marine dress

They call me Mr. Fly I keep the S on my chest
See I move faster than a bullet
So I can hold ya down
I could jump big buildings in a single bound

that's why they call me Superman, super, duper lover
Imagine what the boy Mims do beneath the covers
I ain't 702, but you complete my stillo
Look up in the sky, got you flyin' in the G4

See we flyin', better yet we soar and it?s lonely at the top
But the bottom is so boring, bottom of the pot
Ya'll n*** in sole order, whenever they see me like
The people wind up on me like

Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky, it?s a bird, it?s a plane
No, it?s me

'cause I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm

Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky, it?s a bird, it?s a plane
No, it?s me

'cause I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm fly
I'm fly, I'm fly, I'm

Call me Superman, Superman
Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky

Call me Superman, Superman
Call me Mr. Fly, keep the S on my chest
Call me Superman, Superman

Hold up, wait
Look up in the sky
Call me Superman, Superman

But she cant cause she know I'm in love with the doe
Plus the ride that she's on is to emotional

You can lead if you may but then I hear you say

Riding on that roller coaster none of us is feeling it
The notion got me feeling sick I don't want to lose this
Money or relationship please don't let me choose this
Shes on a constant mood switch but I say theirs no right or wrong
She swears that shes right I'm wrong shes always trying to prove shit
I be on that cool shit she be on that bull shit
She says that I love her but don't love her like my music

His mind would rather fly beyond the classroom cage

He can take the teacher's voice
Turn it into music from another place
All the other kids don't have that choice
Hanging on to every word the teacher says

Day and night, we will be touched
Standing in the light, don't shadow the genius

So out of school he walks alone
Soon his thoughts are flowing like a golden stream
An empty house he calls his own
This place becomes a temple to a silent dream

Sometimes he will clap and sing
Then deep in meditation he will learn to be
And only birds upon the wing
With upward fascination claim to be so free

Day and night, we will be touched
Standing in the light, don't shadow the genius

Your smile, your freedom
Comes to you from within
Still a child with a reason
You're afraid but it's time to begin

Blow the wind of change
Though the words are strange to hear
Say what's on your mind
Now is not the time for fear

Sunlight through a window falls across the page

And rising up inside him is a burning rage

Far away from me
How I used to savour all your kisses
Where no one else could see

Exchanging knowing glances across the schoolroom
Dreamin` of a love down by the sea
Changing plans to cover up for one another
Working on our secret fantasy

But now as I walk down the road to your house baby
There`s no one there but me
How I wish that I could steal your kisses
Just as they used to be
And I want to know

Tracie, where are you now girl
I don`t know why this feeling`s so strong
Tracie, where have you been
You know there`s no one now to tell us we`re wrong

Countin` by the street lights to the phone box
Where we used to meet before the dawn
Smoking on the top floor of the school bus
Promising the moon as we rode along

But now if I saw you across a crowded dance floor
Or somewhere in the town
Would you show me what I have been missing
And spin me round and round

Tracie, where are you now girl
I don`t know why this feeling`s so strong
Tracie, where have you been
You know there`s no one now to tell us we`re wrong

`Cause deep inside from some other place
I turn to find we`re there face to face
We laugh, we cry, we work and we play
As love filled night gives way to the day

And I know this
I want the life that love can give
Now I know what it means

In years of wasted promises

Only love can make some sense of it

A love to share
When two hearts collide and beat as one
Now I know you care

Recalling romances and all the bright chances
But none of them lasted. they passed through her heart

Where is a man who can build a good fire
With a passion as wide as the sky at high noon
A man whose hand is strong as his longing
Where is the man who can lasso the moon

She falls asleep and her dreams are her blanket
And she shares with the moon the secret she knows
As the dawn leaves it's tears to wash the dry valley
The tears of a woman can wash a man's soul

Spinning madly on lines defined
By each others gravity.

The light of memory
There is no hope
There's no hope

Played at the speed of light
Red shifting

She saw me in a different light
She showed me things I thoughht I could be
Are not a million miles away

As surely as night follows day
It follows, I'm a king not a slave
It is another case of déjà vu
It seems to happen everyday
It all comes back to me whatever I do
There's always been a price to pay

Past lives, past lives
You can never put the ghost to bed
Get the feeling that you live, forever she said

Past lives, past lives
Rub my stomach while I pat my head
Get the feeling in your mind
When you're out of your head

And to the eastern side of the bay
My shadow is sailing away
Treasure possessions and money to burn
I won't be taking these with me
I hear the echos and I've nowhere to turn
After all I'm at sea

Past lives, past lives
We can anchor off the coast she said
The storm will pass and the fog will clear in your head

Past lives, past lives
You can never put the ghost to bed
Get the feeling that you live forever she said

In another world when dreams collide
To the mocking bird of faith we tied
She comes to pass but not to stay
Through the looking glass, she fades away

She sold me down the river of life

Thought I could wipe away the memory

By the people in this town
And the way they go about their world
Have they given up
All the fun they used to have in adolescent xanadu

They're too busy with their social climbing
Waiting for a rise

Why can't people just be people

When they were young
They would wish for the summer evenings that would never end
Now the day's too long
And the key to life is locked away in childhood memories

If the wine he buys is seasonable
They've time for friendship if it's advantageous
And causes no pain

Chorus:

Why are people so deceitful
Why can't people just be people

There is more to the world
Than is offered by the soap and war found on the tv screen
And there is more to this life
If you would only take the time to look within and find the key
Don't believe words when they're superficial
Don't put your trust in values artificial
Let your heart do the talking for a little
And feel yourself shine

Why can't people just be people

Now you've made your mark on it 
I know you believed the hope of it 
You know nobody wins 
It's the way you lose that keeps it hopeful 

Didn't I tell you I will be there 
Didn't I show you 
I really care 

You spoke of your plans for it 
You talked all about your destiny 
I could see the rain clouds 
But I couldn't stop the rain from falling 
You tried to go way beyond it 
You'd already made the most of it 
Nothing wrong with dreaming 
Just don't fool yourself about the meaning 

Didn't I tell you the way back home 
Didn't I warn you to stay on the road 
Didn't I help you to understand 
That life is just time passing thru your plans 

You say that you can't let go of it 
That your life only works because of it 
You're afraid that you can't hold on to it 
But your heart doesn't seem so sold on it 
Why not try to believe the heart of it 
Why not try to perceive the art in it 
Why not let me be more a part of it 
Didn't I tell you that I'd be there 
Didn't I show you that I really care 

Didn't I tell you the way back home 
Didn't I warn you to stay on the road 
Didn't I help you to understand 
That life is just time passing thru your hands

Level 42,"Our dad would send us to our room
He'd be the voice of doom
He said that we would thank him later
All day he was solid as a rock
But by eight o'clock
We'd be crumbling
One night
My brother Joe and me
Climbed down the family tree
That grew outside our bedroom window
We ran though we knew it couldn't last
Running from the past
From things that we were born to be

Looking back it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre

Dad rang the officer in charge
A man so large
He barely fit his circumstances
He said two kids out on the street
Were picked up on the beat
And in the station
So there's me
With Emily and Joe
Daddy driving home
All heading in the same direction
He knew no matter what the breaks
We'd make the same mistakes
Couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me

Looking back it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the backseat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
Looking back it's so bizarre

Like a dream within a dream
We're all somewhere in between

Like a drummer plays his drum
Like a father like a son
And your gonna have to face the music

Hey hey
We keep it running in the family
Hey hey
We keep it coming in the family

Hey hey
We keep it running in the family
Hey hey
We keep it coming in the family


Looking back it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the backseat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes
Take me back into your arms
It's no longer a mystery
There's no cause for alarm
Could have never come this far
With no sense of history
It always leaves a scar
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre

Running in the family

Running in the family
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre hey",Running in the Family,2007

Leave the western world behind
Cross the mountains to Peking
Where the paper lanterns gently swing

The Chinese way

My eyes wide open
I feel a breeze
Words softly spoken
In Cantonese

Standing at the master's side
There with patience he confides
Secret knowledge, sacred ways
Pearls of wisdom from the dragon days

I could never lie
For honor I would die
Following the Chinese way
So many years ago hero's ruled the world
(Some died for love)
They were the only ones in a cruel world

They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance,
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing,
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes,
I have been blind;

The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek,
There's nobody here, it's just you and me,
It's where I want to be,
But I hardly know this beauty by my side,
I'll never forget the way you look tonight;

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight,
I've never seen you shine so bright, you were amazing,
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side,
And when you turned to me and smiled, it took my breath away,
And I have never had such a feeling,
Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight;

There's nobody here, it's just you and me,

Seeing you wandering the world
Little shiny eyes wide open
I'll pray you get to learn to live

See the woods
Tune your ears to the sounds of nature
I hope that when I'm gone they'll still be there

In my fruitless search for the thruth

Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Talking perfectly loud

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But what we hadn't ? get the gat from one of my ?
On the tough, Uncle Bruce ?
Hustle in my veins and lungs, sucker pump

Chicken heads squash through my hood with good intentions
But always end up sparkin' antennas on bus benches
Watchu know, whatchu say, what's the sco'?
Is it a go? Then you with me after the show
You smell? We hit the hotel, and knock boots
Taught me some thangs, like who? Like Dr. Ruth
Hey, hoe

Then have the nerve to say they made it up, now that's some hoes
That ain't no stickin' to the rules and regulation ship
That ain't no man if he can't admit he grew up on The Click
On the east they got hot dogs and pretzel stands
On the west they got tacos and burrito vans

In the south, it's ? and biscuit
What about the Midwest? The Midwest, dey just love to kick it
Top shelf, ghetto tycoon the area sponsor
Can't be seen like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster
Dialin' for dollars paper route and money counters
Scrilla scratchin', paper chasin', poppin' collars

Smoke real fat big blunts

Act like you're livin'

I ain't no captain at the bar, signin' autographs on napkins
Ball 'til we have it all, bartender talkin' about
""Last call for alcohol"" I'm 'bout to get to mashin' on that ?
If we don't get no mo' ? throw glasses at that Moesha fag
And I'm walkin' up out the do', step stuck and stutterin'
Didn't even screw up and hit the floor
If I woulda fell, it woulda been embarrassing
Full of that there liquor, walked into a closet
But I'm a king size nigga, baby, pull my coattail and just

Working hard tending bar soaking up all the knowledge 
You can find serving wine to the ladies at Francesca's porch

She walked in with her friends, they were mad celebratin'
Twenty years of marriage to an ex she called satan
So I poured her a shot and I walked it across that floor
And the ladies all roared

Come on, come on, come on Ms. Marianne (come on and do it, you know you wanna do it now)

After two lunch hours all her friends were deserting
She walked up to the bar and started Chardonnay flirting
Said you probably can't tell it but you're half the age I am, mmm
She said boy you're a flavor that I've never picked
But if you were on the end of a Popsicle stick
I would eat you up as you melted all over my hand
I said ooh, yes ma'am

As the blood rushed to my face
And she smiled at me 'cause I didn't know what to say

I was still thinkin' over the offer she was makin'
She was every boy's dream, so breathtaking
And I was holding that thought as her friends pulled her away
I said, ""I wish you'd stay""

In the sky, Lord, in the sky

For this lady, you are hauling

He's a short order cook
Long on speed and he's short on spice
He reads his customers like a book

He's seen this, and he's done that
And now he's makin' fried eggs an art
But there's one thing he can't fix no how
There's a longing in his heart

Tried for years to work it out
At the grill and at his home
Talks to his friends, he talks to himself
He'd talk the chicken right off the bone

Talks to his woman and she understands
You know they're always eye to eye
Well, she runs the joint, they live out back
It's a small house under a big sky

And even the stars at night agree
The sky is fallin' apart
And she knows 'cause she can feel it too
There's a longing in her heart
Longing in her heart

Well, you and me, we're just like them
We never wanted to be alone
So we made a pact, sealed with desire
For a happier house and home

Only to find, it doesn't untie
The knot where feelings die
There's a longing deep inside our hearts
Oh, and no one to tell us why

Well, our friends ain't lookin' for anything new
You know, they wouldn't know where to look
Well, her, she likes runnin' that joint
And he likes bein' a cook

Together they're doin' very well
You know they're mighty glad they could
Well, there's a fire burnin' and it's towards them now
Comin' from a distant wood

She collapses down upon the ocean floor again

Tears in waves minds on fire
Nights alone by your side

Catskill mansions buried screams I'm alive
She cried but I don't know what it means
Somewhere out there across the moonlit sands
There's a line drawn like the lines on her own hand
And slamming her eyes locking the door
She collapses down upon the ocean floor again

The rail bed was frozen with ice
In the distance an engine was keepin' good time
The steam whistle moaned just twice
Down in the cut past the old trestle bridge
Twelve fine horses stood
Masked men shivered in the cold on the ridge
Not far from the Glendale woods

The brass lamp shone from the swayin' train
When the driver saw the red light
Her iron brakes sparked like silver rain
And the metals screamed through the night
The baggage man peered out to look for the fault
When fear froze up his heart
He was starin' down the barrel of an army colt
That threatened to tear him apart

Open up your damned express car and jump down to the ground

Frank and Jesse James

In long soldiers coats frayed with years
Quickly they scrambled aboard
The men was a-sweatin' and the women shed tears
And a preacher prayed to the Lord
When they opened the safe there was nothing for them
So they strolled down through the train
What a miserable sight, these desperate men
Robbin' old folks for their gold watch chains

Now some say the devil had taken his soul
Some say his spirit survived
But we all know he was nothin' but a Missouri farm boy

You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1960
Lew Davies,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1961
Lew Davies,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1962
Lew Davies,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back
So if you want to have fun in this man's land
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands""

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill

I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face
While she went down to the powder place

With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The music stopped and the lights came on
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Must have been part of the game,

I wrote into your book,
Next to my name: 

""Roses are red, my love. 
Violets are blue.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1999
Lewis James,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy [From Mary Jane McKane],2004
Lewis Keel,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day,1990
Lewis Keel,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1990
Lewis Keel,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,1990
Lewis Leslie,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,2008
Lewis Nash,"Times have changed
And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(if any brains you've got)
From those little radios

So Mrs. R.
With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmon's
Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes",Anything Goes,1997
Lewis Nash,"Breeze, stop moanin' those weird melodies
My (man, gal) has left me and I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues
Your rhythm on my window pane
Drives me insane because I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues
My heart is so broken, I've spoken
To the Lord for sympathy
And if He don't help me
So help me !  It's the bottom of the deep blue sea
For me, I'm gonna end this misery
My (man, gal) has left me and I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues",I Can't Face the Music,1997

Everything's OK
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong

Lewis Nash,"Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has MacHeath, babe
And it keeps it way out of sight
When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows begin to spread
Fancy gloves, wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday mornin
Lies a body oozin' life
Someone's sneakin' round that corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

Oh there's a tugboat down, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
Now MacHeath spends, he spends like a sailor
Could that boy have done somethin' rash?

Ahhhh Jenny Diver, ho, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe

Lewis Nash,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1997
