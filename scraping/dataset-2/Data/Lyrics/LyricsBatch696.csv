Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2007
Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2007
Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"Have I a hope for half a chance,
To even ask if I could dance with you? you hoo!
Would you greet me or politely turn away?
Would there suddenly be sunshine on a cold and rainy day?
Oh, babe! what would you say?

For there are you, sweet lollipop,
Here am I with such a lot to say, hey, hey!
Just to walk with you along the Milky Way.
To caress you through the night time, bring you flowers every day
Oh, babe! what would you say?

Guess, though, baby, I know,
I know I could be so in love with you!
And I know that I could make you love me too.
And if I could only hear you say you do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
But anyway, what would you say?

Guess, though, baby, I know,
I know I could be so in love with you!
And I know that I could make you love me too.
And if I could only hear you say you do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
But anyway, what would you say?","Oh Babe, What Would You Say?",2007

Matt Clohesy,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far is the journey

Matt Clohesy,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away

Somebody hurt you and break your heart' 
Well love's a gamble, sometimes lost, but you never give in, 'cause

Hi ho be gone and lets just dance

Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself
And if you are waiting, waiting for me
Know I'll be home soon darling I guarantee
I'll be home Sunday just in one week
Dry up your tears if you start to weep
And sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Lullaby, I'm not nearby
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Don't you cry, no don't you cry
Sing this lullaby to yourself
'Cause when I arrive dear it won't be that long
No it won't seem like anytime that I've been gone
It ain't the first time it won't be the last
Won't you remember these words to help the time pass?
So when you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005

You make me smile with my heart

You're looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay

Each day is Valentine's Day

Will bring all of you to a new understanding and value of life.
A vision that inspires you to live and love on Planet Earth.
Like a priceless jewel,
Buried in dark layers of soil and stone.
Earth radiates her brilliant beauty,
Into the caverns of space and time.
Perhaps you are aware of those who watch over your home,
And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality.
You are becoming aware of yourself as a gamemaster.

Imagine Earth restored to her regal beauty.
Stately trees seem to brush the deep blue sky.
Clouds billow to form majestic peaks.
The songs of birds fill the air,
Creating symphony upon symphony.

Of what she allows to be created
From the core-mystery of the blood.

You take my pride but I need you still

Matt Dusk,"Cry sad tears, then dry your eyes and mend your heart 
Life's too short to waste sweet time, love is gone now you must start
Deep blue eyes smile at you across the room 
You say that his brown, and he is not the guy that you once knew 

Don't go looking for, that heart you loved before 
You can't replace him with the same kind of face 
Don't dream that sweet old dream. Its not the final scene 
Be open to somebody else, someone new. 

Change brings fear as clouds will always bring the rain, 
But when it finally clears their sun will shine to make it bright again 
Let love in, you might feel it deeper still, 
But if you hide away, I swear you never will

The gods decide how blessed am I 
The days to come for every mother's son

Than I was a king for a day 
Once the web is spun, for every mother's son

It took five hours to say goodbye 
Five weeks to wonder why
And five months of just rain 

I had a path 
That led me home 
It gathered no moss 
But now I'm alone 

There was five minutes without air 
Five hours without meaning 
Five weeks without insight 
And Five months 'till I sing

To pause for justice 
No peace for a while

Like a moth that finds love in a flame

Surrounded, we always found an escape

Greedy for the good things as well as the bad

A sigh is just a sigh

Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
But the world will always welcome lovers

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1998

Matt Ender,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Matt Fouch,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention
I want to introduce to you
In this corner of the good and the right
Stands a champion, robed in white
His height exceeds the heavens
His weight outweighs the world
His reach reaches everywhere
His age is evermore

[Chorus]
He is higher than the highest
Greater than the great
No one will ever take His crown away
He is more mighty than the mightiest
He reigns from above
He's the all-time, undisputed, undefeated
Champion of Love

He left his hometown to enter this arena
To raise His hands in victory for all of you and me
But an angry crowd crucified this King who bore their crown
And they gladly watched the champion going down
But I will never count Him out
For I'm a witness of
The day He arose to retain the title,
""Champion of Love""

It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.

The pines and the willows know soon we will part
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken
And a love that will always remain in my heart

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter
The magic of moving as one
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done

Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

Over the lake the stars shine

Matt Hammitt,"And oh to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten
Then nailed to a cross of wood

This the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

And oh to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
And every bitter thought, every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

This the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

And oh to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free
And death is crushed to death and life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This the power of the cross
Son of God slain for us
What a life, what a cost

Something he was not looking for both a beginning and an end

When he catches his reflection on accident 

On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still resigned.

Yeah love is waiting this is all just a temporary ghost
A temporary ghost

Familiar words will greet you well
Your hands will hold more than you held
You?ll see the sun shine when you hear your name
When you hear your name

Hold your place when the words are on the wall and you can?t find your fire
Escape
I?m running for you now so don?t let go
And trees hang low and clouds suffocate the sun so you can see
Put a signal in the sky for me

Oh hold your place when the words are on the wall and you can?t find your
Fire escape
I?m running for you now so don?t let go

Matt Hires,"Twelve o'clock.
The lights are glowing on the sidewalk of the cars.
A river moving down the street.
The subways rumble underneath my feet.

So why oh why am I the only one
To see the gold inside
The only one to hear the music in the mystery, 
The music when she looks at me.

I hear the rhythm of the midnight rain.
My heart is beating like a bullet train
To the melody in my blood.
Ohh Voices ringing in the city streets
Sirens turning into symphonies.
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up.
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.

A record plays, 
My thoughts are turning into
Crashing tidal waves
That carry all the buildings out to sea.
It doesn't matter much to me.

I'm so caught inside a beautiful commotion.
When chords collide, 
And everything is fine and
There's music in the mystery.
There's music when she looks at me.

I hear the rhythm of the midnight rain.
My heart is beating like a bullet train
To the melody in my blood.
Ohh Voices ringing in the city streets
Sirens turning into symphonies.
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up.
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.

Ooooh ooooh ooooh.

Twelve o'clock.
The lights are glowing on the sidewalk of the cars.
A river moving down the street.
And nothing looks the same to me.

I hear the rhythm of the midnight rain
My heart is beating like a bullet train
To the melody in my blood, 
To the melody in my blood.
Voices ringing in the city streets
Sirens turning into symphonies.
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up.
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.
This is the sound of falling, 
This is the sound of falling, 
The sound of falling in love.",The Sound of Falling in Love,2013
Matt Hochmiller,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,

Maybe I'll play this role
Maybe I'll act like my act is together
Maybe I'll go through life without hope
And maybe I'll open the door and fall through the floor

I could open the door and breathe in the dust
And I could walk through those flames till I don't feel their touch
Oh but how can I leave when I know what's out there

Maybe I could stop
Focusing on the particular
Could you help me
Stop focusing on the particular

Matt Mahaffey,"We can write the chapters of existence starting now
Starting now, we'll throw it all down
I can see the shadows in the water on the ground, on the ground
They follow me around

behind every story there's a quick end
Behind every smile there's a clown
To understand it I guess I'd have to be a dead man trying not to laugh out loud

I can hear a lonely operator on the phone, on the phone
She can't call home
Overseas burned to third degree and the collection plate's been passed and received by me
I wish I could tell you, all you children, why you're here, why you're here
We'd all sing along
Isn't that something 'cause there is no knowing 'til you're gone
When I'm gone I'll prove you all wrong

behind every woman there's a good man trying not to bug the hell out
To understand it guess I'd have to be a dead man trying not to laugh out loud

no don't take me under

behind every story there's a quick end
Behind every smile there's a clown
To understand it I guess I'd have to be a dead man trying not to laugh out
Behind every woman there's a good man trying not to bug the hell out
To understand it, guess I'd have to be a dead man trying not to laugh out loud
Trying not to laugh out loud
Trying not to laugh out loud

Matt Mahaffey,"You must be, a radio station
And who are we, we must be
The number one songs, spinning all day long

And over again
And we know when
When we call in
And nothings free
Sounds to me like
State run radio

We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The futures cloudy and it's raining on the poor class
The roads to peace are closed, heavy traffic's on the war paths
Love is balling on a budget
The military's says its going to need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas
Keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore pass
Stay inside of your half, believe the lies you learn in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash and the ceiling has the same feeling
That the floor has, and that's where you should stay
This is what they play

And over again
And we know when
When we call in
And nothings free
Sounds to me like
State run radio 

You're now tuned into the weakest
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that, you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Hi, your on the air, now what you want to hear?
Well we ain't got the truth, but how about a remix
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart you will be a superstar
And if you dumb or something maybe you could be number one

And over again
And we know when
When we call in
And nothings free
Sounds to me like
State run radio 

So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not getting airplay
Independent spirit, you can barely hear what they're saying
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back-to-back on relay
We're really where it lives
Make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJ's

You must be, a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinning all day long
And you put me on daily rotation
You're on the air, we know you're scared
But we don't care, we'll play this here

Over again
And we know when
When we call in
And nothings free
Sounds to me like

It's coming down

Long after the sun goes down
And your mind it keeps on racing
At the dreams that don't come 'round

When the dark holds you and you can't break through

And all the prisoners breaking their chains
And all the poor find their treasure

Matt Maher,"Young man on the side of the road
Lost and beat up with nowhere to go
Smells like a hangover from days ago
He does what he can to survive

Single mom with a dead end job
Ninety hour week just to keep what she's got
With the bills that add up and now she's caught
She does what she can to survive

Well, let me say
That love won't take away the pain
But don't be afraid
'Cause it will never walk away

If you're scared that you don't matter
If you're lost and need to be found
If you're looking for a Savior
All you gotta do is turn around

Some turn to a bottle
Some turn to a drug
Some turn to another's arms
But it seems like it's never enough

Well I won't say, that you will never fail again
But there is grace
To wash away your every sin

If you're scared that you don't matter
If you're lost and need to be found
If you're looking for a Savior
All you gotta do is turn around

No one listens to you anymore
And your heart has broken down
You don't need to move
Love has come to you
All you gotta do is turn around
All you gotta do is turn around
Turn around

You don't have to take the broken road
You can turn around and come back home

You don't have to take the broken road
You can turn around and come back home

Where the wind's so rough it can carry you to London

For the light of day

Yeah they gave me a heart to endure most anything

More than fireworks and fanfare
More than a star-spangled banner

Count the lines on my face and wonder how they got there
Oh but every one's a story of how grace appeared
And carried me through the day

Moonlight dancin' over the Dakotas

Carolina Coast to the Rocky Mountains

And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Matt Matthews,"The cold wind blew, the preacher grieved
He said ""they're comin' after me
I ain't exactly what I seem to be""	 
He pulled his pistol from his side
Pointed it at me and cried
And then he laid a bullet deep in my chest
He stood still revealin' the story
That I knew was true before
And now because of it I lay dying
He claimed to run with Jesse James
William Bonnie, and they all the same
""I ain't no preacher man, I was born of fire""

Hey, can't you hear that train coming now?
Rollin' fast down the tracks, to hell they're bound
Well I'm in over my head again
I hear those pistols layin' 	down
And I have taken the lives of many men
Now the angel's comin' down
I said the angel of death is coming down

Well, up in the horizon
Laid the red sun, beatin' cold and dying
And taking with it all the lives the preacher stole
Well, you see, the preacher is not real
He clench his fists of rage and steel
And spit the fires of Satan at your soul
He beat the path to Heaven's door
The angels said they'd take no more
Now he walks the Earth forever lone
And on the stone that marked his death
When he did finally lay to rest
Were the lonely words ""I'm going home""",The Preacher (Intro),2001

How does it feel

To say goodbye

To all the times we had before

Guess it don't matter

It don't matter anymore


If you're ever in Eastern Passage

You'd better not come knockin' on my door

'cause it don't matter

It don't matter anymore


Time, lord give me some time

To rid my head of these things I can't ignore

Like your fists poundin' on my door


All I want some piece of mind to help me get through

Oh, it don't matter,

It don't matter anymore

It came comin' from far away

Riding along plains,

Down through the rivers and streams

To visit me in a dream


I left my life behind

Buried it in the sand

Maybe I'll get back someday and dig it up again


Lost souls stay gone for good

To keep a satisfied mind


I saw it comin' from far away

It was fallin' down with the rain

Movin' from the rivers and streams

Shot it right into the vein


I left my life behind

I buried it in the sand

Maybe I'll get back someday and dig it up again

Maybe I'll get back someday and dig it up again

And dig it up again


Lost souls stay lost for good

Keep your satisfied mind

Disappear into the night

Killer instinct, love a surprise
Make a stop, build a fire
Hold you breathe, cover your eyes
The tides are turning crimson
Nightfall growing like a cancer
Feeding on your broken body
Isolations not the answer
Listen what the wind says softly
Sound of traffic, smells like paper
Kisses on your worried eyelids
Sleepless nights turn into vapor
Like a dream and as the crow flies
Must reject the pain your trapped in
Give me all your hard earned beauty
Now I'll tell you what will happen

Your day will fade and your thoughts will jade
And you'll wake up in the middle of a dream
Coming up on hard luck, with a moment of silence
And no time to kill, no reason to care
Beware

I can see it all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
I can see is all in your eyes
Your future for a dime, anytime
I can see it all in your eyes

Waiting for you
Darlin' don't be afraid,
I have loved you for a
Thousand years
I'll love you for a
Thousand more

And all along I believed
I would find you
Time has brought
Your heart to me
I will love you for a
Thousand years
I'll love you for a
Thousand more

Matt McAndrew,"Oh, wasted love

So I'm not supposed to love you no more
I guess I'm not supposed to care
I held you so close, now I'm holding a ghost
How can love just disappear?
And where does it go when it's over?
I know that it's somewhere out here

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to justify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Oh, wasted love
Oh, wasted love

It's late, I'm drunk and I'm running on empty tonight
Baby, I'm chasing my shadow around
Like smoke cigarettes I inhale these regrets
I can't change what I've become
There's pain and there's glory, but this is my story
I'm asking everyone

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die trying to testify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me, save me?

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die let me testify, that's how it's gonna be
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?

Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow

So let's get drunk on our tears and

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
'Woe is me' if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let all these memories bring you sorrow

Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending

Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done, my love
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know for you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

Matt McGee,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And he swears there will never be another on
In the dark recess of the mine, where you age before your time
And the coal dust lies heavy on your lungs

Rosy apples the call forbidden fruit 
What I'm about to say is 
Confidential so promise you'll be mute. 
Because if every creature in the garden knows 
They'll come 'round like hungry buffaloes 
And in no time there'll be none of those 
Precious apples left for you and me. 

Now in the average apple 
You're accustomed to skin, seeds, flesh and core 
But you will find that these are 
Special apples that give you something more 
Why, every seed contains some information you 
Need to speed your education, the 
Seeds, indeed, of all creation are here 
Why, be foolish my dear 
Come with me 
To that tree. 

With every sweet and juicy 
Luscious bite of this not forbidden fruit 
You'll see your mind expand and 
Your perceptions grow more and more acute 

And you can teach him plumbing and philosophy 
New techniques for glazing pottery 
Wood-craft, first-aid, home economy 
Madam, Adam will be overjoyed! 

When he becomes aware of 
Your attainments he'll beam with loving pride 
And he will say, 

""o, eve, you're 
Indispensable! please, don't leave my side!"" 
And with your nifty,new-found education, he'll 
Relish every conversation,why 
You'll be Adam's inspiration this way! 
Just an apple a day 
Wait and see 
Come with me 
To that tree!

Matt Monro,"When we played our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
That music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will
Best on the bill
Charade",Charade,1994
Matt Monro,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo,1994
Matt Monro,"Hear my voice where you are
Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me
Catch a plane, catch a breeze
On your hands, on your knees
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me
On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care, this is where you should be
From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me
Blast your hide, hear me call
Must I fight City Hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on Earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
Or to wreck and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in Hell can you be?
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a Royce or a van, wrapped in mink or Saran
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the din
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
Come by rail,
Come by mail, COD
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux
Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
On the drags and the glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate
I don't care this is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (Shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back

Matt Monro,"Gray skies are gonna clear up,
Put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face.

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style;
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!

Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,
Slap on a happy grin!

And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
So, put on a happy face",Put on a Happy Face,1994
Matt Monro,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Long as stars are in the blue,
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing,
I'll go on loving you.

Till the end of time,
Long as roses bloom in May,
My love for you will grow deeper,
With every passing day.

Till the wells run dry,
And each mountain disappears,
I'll be there for you, to care for you,
Through laughter and through tears.

So, take my heart in sweet surrender,
And tenderly say that I'm,
The one you love and live for,
Till the end of time.",Till the End of Time,1994
Matt Monro,"Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me and no one beside me
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after

I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you on a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?

Makin' a crazy 'ding dong'.
And if this band don't desert me,
Then there's nothin' in the world can hurt me,
Long as I'm singing my song.

Give me trumpets legato, 
Put some saxes with 'em,
Strings pizzicato and some rhythm.
As long as I'm singing,
Then the world's all right and everything's swingin'

I'm happy, happy

Footsteps that you hear down the hall

That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1995

Matt Monro,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls

As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December

And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring

They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart

Shut the fridge and joined the throng

Screwed her eyes up, had a peep
Saw the marchers, heard their voices
Making early morning noises
Stumbled back to bed and tried to sleep

You'll be amazed, so full of praise
When we've rearranged your world

Went the marchers, spirits low
Grunting greetings, grimly pressing
Onto where they had to go

Stopped to have their thermos brew

Pondered for a little, sadly
Then got on with what she had to do

'Up the marches', banners go
Chanting, shouting out with leaflets
Protest for everyone to know

Sit in front of all the traffic
Harried, busy shopping wives
Try to stir their ostrich notions
Whip them up to wild emotions
Put some fire into their wretched lives

By a policeman from the road
Margaret Beatty had her face slapped
By a man she tried to goad

Paused in typing, thought of Don
Glanced again at his last letter
Died for others to live better
Brushed away a tear and carried on

Maybe we really belong together
But after all, how little we know

Maybe it's just for a day
Love is as changeable as the weather

Why stars in the trees hide when it rains

Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell

Maybe you're meant to be mine

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away",If You Go Away (No Me Dejes),1999
Matt Monro,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught. 
To say the things he truly feels; 
And not the words of one who kneels. 
The record shows 
I took the blows 
And did it my way!",My Way,1999

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?

Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" every day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,

Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Matt Monro,"Poor boy! Poor boy!
Down-hearted and depressed and in a spin
Poor boy! Poor boy!
Oh, youth can really do a fellow in!

How lovely to sit here in the shade
With none of the woes of man and maid
I'm glad I'm not young anymore

The rivals that don't exist at all
The feeling you're only two feet tall
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

No more confusion
No morning-after surprise
No self-delusion
That when you're telling those lies
She isn't wise

And even if love comes through the door
The chance that goes on forevermore
Forevermore is shorter than before
Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore

The tiny remark that tortures you
The fear that your friends won't like her too
I'm glad I'm not young anymore
The longing to end the stale affair
Until you find out she doesn't care
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

No more frustration
No star-crossed lover am I
No aggravation
Just one reluctant reply
""Lady, goodbye!""

The Fountain of Youth is dull as paint
Methuselah is my patron saint
I've never been so comfortable before
Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore",I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore,2002

Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world,

How you were frightened by the clown,
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew,
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for

You and me against the world,

And for all the times we've cried I always felt that
God was on our side.

I've had every accolade bestowed on me
And so you see

If I never sing another song
It wouldn't bother me
I had my share of fame
You know my name

If I never sing another song
Or take another bow
I would get by, but I'm not sure how

Always posing, but you love it all
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all
Everything I did the world applauded
Once upon a star

Framed citations, hung on every wall
Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all
There were times I felt the world belonged to me
And so you see

It wouldn't bother me

Let's not talk of all the times we've been lonely
But let us speak of the times we will know
From today I will live for you only
Wish I'd said all these things long ago

All of a sudden this world's yours and mine
All of a sudden water tastes like wine
Now every moment there are songs to sing
All of a sudden everything

Matt Monro,"After watching your appeal from ev'ry angle
there's a big romantic deal I've got to wangle
For I've fallen for a certain luscious lass
And it's not a passing fancy or a fancy pass

I love the look of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you **
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you",All of You,2006
Matt Monro,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2006
Matt Monro,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2006

The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips
And the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar
A thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out",Day in Day Out,2006
Matt Monro,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the Moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight

Matt Monro,"The soul is up for hire, we sold out the heart. The truth lies deep under our skin, Bite the hand that gives, kiss the hand that takes. Where in the world can I turn and look to? Things never change they fade away. The Church of Love ... it's law and disorder. We're meant to give more than we take. Calling Gods on high, it's in your name millions die, Silenced those who scream, no golden cold image can redeem, The tongue tells lies, minds deceive. I turn around and see a finger pointing at me.

Where in the world can I turn and look to? Things never change they fad away. The Church of Love ... it's law and disorder Where cheating hearts can kneel and pray. Put your feet on the water, play Jesus for the day... They say the times are a changin', we've woken to our ignorance, truly I believe but I find it hard to see.

And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

With every paper I'd deliver

If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes

With a pink carnation and a pickup truck

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown

No verdict was returned

Eight miles high and falling fast

While sergeants played a marching tune

Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

The green leaves of summer are callin' me home.
'twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.

And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for livin', a place for to die.

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call

There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet

Stopped to have their thermos brew
Annie Harris got up gladly
Pondered for a little, sadly
Then got on with what she had to do

So, come with us, run with us
We're gonna change the world
You'll be amazed, so full of praise
When we've rearranged your world
We're gonna change your world

At their target, numbers swollen
'Up the marches', banners go
Chanting, shouting out with leaflets
Protest for everyone to know

Sit in front of all the traffic
Harried, busy shopping wives
Try to stir their ostrich notions
Whip them up to wild emotions
Put some fire into their wretched lives

So, come with us, run with us
We're gonna change your world
You'll be amazed, so full of praise
When we've rearranged your world
We're gonna change your world

Shirley Wood was dragged still sitting
By a policeman from the road
Margaret Beatty had her face slapped
By a man she tried to goad

Annie Harris in the office
Paused in typing, thought of Don
Glanced again at his last letter
Died for others to live better
Brushed away a tear and carried on

Come with us, run with us
We're gonna change the world
You'll be amazed, so full of praise
When we've rearranged your world
We're gonna change
Come with us, run with us

"Matt Monro, Jr.","You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world,
When all the others turn their backs and walked away,
You can count on me to stay.

Remember when the circus came to town
How you were frightened by the clown,
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew,
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for

You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried I always felt that
God was on our side.

And when one of us is gone,
And one of us is left to carry on,
Then remembering will have to do,
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you,
Of you and me against the world.",You and Me Against the World,2005
"Matt Monro, Jr.","I lost at love before,
Got mad and closed the door.
But you said try just once more.
I chose you for the one,
Now I'm having so much fun.
You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you,
All I ever want to do is
Thank you, baby.

Matt Monroe,"When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you.

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you.",When I Fall in Love,2008

You make me shine,
     shine, shine, shine
Looking at me
With stars in your eyes
Trying to say
What I've always wanted to know
You want me to know that you're mine, mine

My, it feels good to believe
In someone
It's been a long time
A lonely time
It's been a hard time
An empty time
Since anyone made me feel

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Dancing to music
And singing each line
As I shine, shine, shine, shine
    shine, shine, shine, shine

Matt Morris,"She was a girl living in the city cleaning the old religion
Praying for electricity to keep her warm for a little while
Nobody made her wise to the things a girl might find
In a belly of a hungry man who don't care nothing about his bloodline
She got lost in his bloodline
Heavy cost of a bloodline
She goes on she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline
So much riding on a bloodline
Why is he hiding from the bloodline?
It ain't right she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline

She heard heaven is invite only preserved for Christian soldiers
Not on wet girls living in the city asking for change from strangers
But father said Jesus loves her even though she never married
God loves her more than the Christians did she's part of his holy bloodline
She got saved in her bloodline
The price he paid for the bloodline
Chased alive she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline
She believes in his bloodline
Lives and breathes by the bloodline
With all her might she cries at night and keeps alive his bloodline

Ohhhhhhhhhh oooooooooooo
I know I should have never left her a shoulder of a burnt eye
She probably won't forgive me god might not even
I made a cross and laid it on her back
But I never broke her spirit and she owes that to her bloodline
She stood strong for the bloodline I did wrong by the bloodline
But she went on she cried at night and kept alive her bloodline

Overloaded by phenylalanine

About other lovers running out of words to say to each other
And how beautiful you thought it was and I agreed that
Would never happen to you and me

We've rehashed the past and beaten it down
Left us with nothing, no present, no future
I still read your letter and all that evil makes me sick
But this is regimented pain and it gives me the illusion
That I have lived
I was the one that pushed you off the pedestal I put you on
And with my arms still outstretched I watched you fall
And break apart like glass on the highway
I realized my mistake a bit too late
Because I'd never risk picking up the pieces,
Jesus look at them all
I'd never risk picking up all those goddamn pieces
Because I lose control at the sight of my own blood

Some band's playing hallelujah

You got someone new singing you your songs now

Then watch the last wall collapse
And sooner surrender
And our love will count for everything

In my sweetest dreams
It's just you and me
And we break wide
I wake reminded love
How I just gave up
And how you moved on, how you moved on

I've waited for now
For the rolling canyons of love
And I'm tongue tied
And you're coming alive, coming alive

Doch die und du ist was mir jetzt so fehlt, ich glaub das,
Einfach nicht!
Gegenüber steht ein Telefon
Es lacht mich ständig an vor Hohn, es klingelt, 
Klingelt aber nicht!

Niemand sagt, hör auf!

Me and Loc use to stand by the store
Hope the cameras was off, I did my own dirt, puttin' all of my own work
How much I could make off of these grams? That was my homework
You can't understand the highway 'till you hit the road first

Same nigga played the corner, bodega with no shirt
Sunflower seeds and Sour Patches, I was askin'
For extensions on the rent, now it's designer fabric (designer)
Couldn't sit on auntie furniture, if not the plastic (we couldn't)

It ain't hard to buy a boat, it's hard to find a captain
It ain't hard to find the smoke, it just depend who askin' (who want it)

I don't drink soda but I'm so familiar with coke deals
They robbed him when he bought it, ain't get to see how that coat feels
Might not know her name but I could tell you how her throat feels
You don't really know me, you ain't know me when I sold pills
Bubb told me don't pour it up if it ain't got no seal
Chill never paid the the bills, mental racin' still
Had no TV, now I pay multiple cable bills
I remember Malil tellin' me ""take the wheel""
Back when Freekey told me rap they probably gonna make a deal
Deafen up my body, I hate the way it make me feel
If my niggas slidin', I'm slidin', I really played the field
We got felonies but jealously can never break us
Talked to Drizzy up in Toronto, I'm missin' hella paper
Most of my niggas do biz chasin' money, go up north and get big
Might not come home to no crib
We got parole on us, walk with the heat, we keep the stove on us
NYPD just pray that I get pulled with old warrants
If you told on us, on God, you broke the code on us

Of dreams in the wings
Of visions unseen

Only your love will do
Cross my heart over you
Cross my heart
There is room enough for two

Matt Pierson,"The twelve of you walked on the earth together
The father was a brother to you all
The teaching that you heard was the Living Word
The wonders and the miracles you saw

There were times of awesome inspiration
There were times you didn't understand
And when He had to go and you felt alone
It must have been so hard to see His plan

I think about the way you carried on
In the face of persecution you stood strong...

[Chorus]
I will follow Christ
I will run the race
Fighting the good fight
Standing on my faith
I will wear the name of Jesus
I will give Him all my life
As for me no matter what the sacrifice
I will follow Christ

Now I don't have to look across the ages
His voice is speaking in my heart today
His Word is like a flame consuming all my shame
His life a shining star to show the way

I behold Your life and see the man You want me to become
Living like someone whose heart belongs to the kingdom
That was sealed on Calvary

Matt Pierson,"So many preachers 
So many churches and denominations 
Got their opinions and their documents

There's a miscommunication

And we complicate the truth 
And convolute the story 
But as far as I recall I do believe it all

[Chorus]
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world Rising from the dead 
Doing what He said He would do 
Loving everyone He saw
When it's said and done it all
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world

It isn't a secret  And maybe I'm being simple minded 
But it's about Jesus and a way, a truth, a life 
That can change a heart and a soul forever 
And we need to be reminded

It's the power of the blood 
That brings us to redemption 
We can rise above the fall 
And the reason for it all

[Chorus]

All the people beneath the steeple 
Are just reaching 
For the truth that can save a helpless soul 
We wrestle with the mystery in the teaching 
But the news is all good I think that we should 
Remember one thing.",Saving the World,1999

Winter changes nothing
The frost east can bring the highways down
I went to a movie I want to believe in

The actors were all looking at me
Stupidly, I sat struck dumb
Will this feel alright with the lights on?
Would it all be right with the lights on?

Lily, there's a picture of your mother
I'm sickened when I see it
It must be something to be her kind
I saw a movie I think, I believe in

The actors all fell back and they were laughing
The frame stopped and I started thinking
Will this feel alright with the lights on?
Would it all be right with the lights on?

There is no sign to be discreet
To clutter up the clearings
This is casting out and waiting
Hanging lines to stay up late with

The cold that holds the corner
Cannot be more boring
Startled now that there's all these lights on
God, it pays to be shortsighted

As we turn once again in the sun
We don't have to drift out of sight
But shadows will fall and run

Yeah, they'll run, they will run, they will run
As the day in time will be done
In the end there will be perfect endlessness
When we're gone, when we're gone, when we're gone

Green turns gold and the gold turns green
As we turn one more time past the sun
Light like no one else has seen
As the shadows will shift to none

Yeah, they'll run, they will run, they will run
As the day's last light soon is done
In the end there will be only endlessness
When we're gone, when we're gone, when we're gone

Your boat tipped straight upright
You thought that sleep was dyin'
You thought it was your time
To give into the endless night

No, you were not right
And I said, ""No it's not, there really is enough
It might just be too much in a couple of weeks
Twenty hours or in ten minutes""

Sky hangs heavy in the lowest light
As the day slips down past the sun
Black and blue in the forest green
Shadows are gone, they have run

They've run, they have run, they have run
As the days last light now is done
In the end we can see perfect endlessness
When we're gone, when we're gone, when we're gone

Your boat tipped straight upright
You thought that sleep was dyin'
You thought it was your time
To give into the endless night

No, you were not right
And I said, ""No it's not, there really is enough
It might just be too much in a couple of weeks
Twenty hours or in ten minutes""

I can feel your hand let go of mine
Drift you to where there isn't any light
And I can never sleep enough, that's right
Something makes me nervous 'bout the night
Something makes me nervous 'bout the night
Something makes me nervous 'bout the night

See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live

Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

It's the beauty and the shame
It's the glory and the name
Wonderful Cross

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live",The Wonderful Cross,2003

And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Listen to the lullaby 
Of old Broadway",Lullaby,2006
Matt Rogers,"Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin' is gonna come my way

Now I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothing is gonna change
Everything still remains the same
And I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

I'm sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Matt Rogers,"Listen baby, ain't no mountain high, 
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough; 
Baby if you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name;  I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me,
Some way, some how.
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand,
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can.
Don't you know that there
 
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
No wind no rain or winters cold can stop me baby,
'Cause you are my goal.
If you're ever in trouble;
I'll be there on the double.
Just send for me, oh baby.
 
If you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.",Ain't No Mountain High Enough,2004
