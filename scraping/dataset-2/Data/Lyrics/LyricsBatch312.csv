Girl Next Door,"Counting ships crossing Lake Blue
You don't seem to notice the light house has blown out
In my need, I'm crying for you
In my bleed, I'm dying for you to sail on
Crossing bridges but I just keep crossing over you
In a limousine in my mind
All that I am is everything you are
I'm your mirror, you're my scar

And I was innocent in your eyes 'til you went blind
I was a real saint
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain?

Putting the pieces together contradicting every word
Believing everyone is against you
""We'll all get you!""
What's that I see crossing Lake Blue
A battleship surrendering to the darkness inside of you

I was innocent in your eyes 'til you went blind
I was a real saint
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain

How much do you need someone to blame for your pain, Boy?
I already said that I was wrong
In exile I'm already gone - if that's what you want
(If that's what you want then I'll give it to you)

I was innocent in your eyes 'til you went blind
I was a real saint
How much do you need someone to blame for your pain?

I was...counting ships crossing Lake Blue",Exile,1998
Girl Next Door,"There are lessons I have learned about my beauty
Did God strike me down?
Some only want me for their own devise
But are you different,
Did God strike you too?

Nobody's perfect
No, no, no nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect except we are
We are perfect for each other

Oh, I can't help it, my feelings are strong
Some will stay and some will go on
I have lived without you for so long
Now, here we are
Let God strike us down

Hey you
Won't you come and play with me tonight
I won't run away
Share your deepest darkest secrets
I can see it in your eyes you're scared
After all you're only human
After all you're only human
After all you're only...(scared) human

Nobody's perfect
No, no, no nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect except we are
We are perfect for each other
...Perfect",Human,1998
Girl Next Door,"I hate to break it to you, we had nothing in common
We were so far apart
You liked Top 40 radio and I had my Joni Mitchell
We were helpless from the start
You wanted something more than I could ever give
You wanted to feel my kiss from the heart
But I only loved you because you're gorgeous

Long, long sleepless nights so unsatisfied
Never wanted a car or your money or a diamond ring
I never asked for anything from you
But I'd take honesty over jealousy any day
Something that you could never give to me
Anyway, I only loved you because you're gorgeous
I only cared because you're gorgeous

Last night you came to me in a dream
I thought my therapy had rid you from my memory
I was wrong
Everyone says, ""I love you""
Everyone says, ""I need you""
Everyone says, ""oh, darling marry me"" so casually it seems
But I only loved you because you're gorgeous
Said, I only stayed because you're gorgeous

Everyone says, ""I love you""
Everyone says, ""I love you""
Everyone says, ""I love you"" so casually it seems
But I only loved you because you're gorgeous
Said, I only smiled because you're gorgeous
Mmm...you're gorgeous

Girl Talk,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996
Girl Thing,"It's a girl thing with the right swing
So move over while we do our thing

It's the end of an era
The start of a new day,
We've got the mic and
We're gonna rock it our way
People sayin' that the world has changed
'Cause the power to the girl
But the girls the same
We've got feminine touch in all the right places
Stars on our eyes and smiles on our faces
Round one is over, hear the bell ring
So move over while we do our thing

Don't get me wrong, we're not tryin' to front
But Cindy was right, girls just want to have fun
It's a girl thing, with the right swing
G for the girl and T for the thing
'Cause life's a game and we all like to play
But when it comes to love 
We love to do it our way
Some say we're physically demanding 
Only 'cause we're the last one standing

Pull you're baby nearer, it's the end of an era
And we're the last one standing
It's your party, keep us here
Let's stay up all night
And be the last one standing

Try forgettin' everything that you've heard before
No matter how many times you hear this
You'll want to hear it some more
This is our year, so have no fear
We're gonna stay, you know we're gonna take it all the way
Tight knitted we're fitted 
No one can break us, take us
Away from each other, brother 
'Cause when the girls want to hit the scene
Together like a team, we're gonna take it to the extreme

A wink and a smile's always worth your while
But when the girls step to it
You know that we can do it
Come and check the vibe and all the rhymes we're bringing
Beat so hard got alarm bells ringing
Watch the girls shine, don't walk away
It's our time, and we want to play
So if you find this physically demanding
It's no surprise we're the last one standing

Pull you're baby nearer, it's the end of an era
And we're the last one standing
It's your party, keep us here
Let's stay up all night

Because we're on tonight 
And there's no denying it

For gettin' down let's party yeah...

Girlicious,"Memories like the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me would we, oh could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter, oh we will remember
Whenever we remember the way we were, the way we were

See I would not replace or erase all our memories
Lessons given to us we learned unselfishly
So take this moment, take an extra breath
With respect for our time, can't rewind what's just meant to be

But now we gotta move on, gotta stay strong
Celebrating us all night long
No regrets, don't forget that our time together was truly beautiful
Theses memories will live forever

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter that we will remember
Whenever we remember the way we were

Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights

Pumps the bass line up into my brains
Screws my mind until I lose control

It's raining men! Hallelujah! It's raining men! amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Hallelujah!

Moving in about to begin
Hear the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Yeah!

According to all sources, the street's the place to go

Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.
It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.

And so do I!

Is far from wrong!

Listen! Listen! echoes sound afar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Echoes sound afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Some think it wrong to set the feet a-dancing,
But not so I;
Some think that eyes should keep from coyly glancing
Upon the sly!
But oh! to me the mazy dance is charming,
Divinely sweet,
And surely there is nought that is alarming
In nimble feet?
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Music sounds afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Ah me! 'tis strange that some should take to sighing,
And like it well;
For me, I have not thought it worth the trying,
So cannot tell!

Full soon is gone,

To call their own!

And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again

Giselle,"Un adiós sin un por què
La ilusión que un día se fue
Una triste soledad en mí
Y tu recuerdo sigue aquí

La pasión que ya no está
Un silencio sin final
La esperanza de volver a ti
A tener tu cuerpo junto a mí

Soñando que tu amor
Un día vendrá
Por siempre tu recuerdo

Y tu mirar
Ahora tú decides regresar
Porque no puedes olvidar
Por eso júrame

Que no es un sueño
Estar de nuevo en ti
Que fue un infierno
No volverte a ver

Que fue un abismo eterno estar
Sin ti mi vida, júrame

Que para siempre regresaste a mí
Que sigue viva la ilusión de ayer
Aún nos queda tanto por vivir, júrame

",Jurame,2000
Giselle,"Yo sé que este amor va conmigo hasta mi último día
Amar de esta forma total es amar de por vida
Ni el agua de los siete mares apaga este fuego
No puedo evitar entregarme a este ardiente deseo

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti
Tocando la cima del cielo deseando tus besos en mí
Sin límite, sin condición, sin causa, sin una razón
Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas

Cierro los ojos pensando si no te tuviera
No habría ni luna ni noches si yo te perdiera
Si acaso naciera otra vez y tuviera esa suerte
Yo solo estaría por ti, por volver a quererte

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti
Tocando la cima del cielo deseando tus besos en mí
Sin límite, sin condición, sin causa, sin una razón
Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas
Me aferro a tu amor, oh, oh, oh, atada a tu amor

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor

What the fuck is ya hobby mami highway robbery
'Cause you got enough jewelry on ya body to buy a Ferrari
I'm like Ruben I'm sorry but I don't studder
Matter fact call me Frank Love 'cause I'd love to fuck ya
She said slow baby don't rush
I promise if you be patient I'll let you tear it up
And nigga sho nuff
We decided to keep in touch with each other you feel me
I didn't know we'd be touching ??
I'm serious, and I'm so sincere
My object is to stay in the clear
'Cause we find fuck and flee these broads round here
I done made so many women shed so many tears
Sittin' home all alone getting drunk off of shots of Bathome
Decided to call let her feelings be known
In a slurred tone, she said I always get what I want
And what I want is you, but I don't get it cuz...

Girl our, situation is getting a little out of my hands
You calling me constant telling bitches that I'm ya man
I thought we was just friends conversating
Gettin' to know one another on a friendly basis
Lets face it we from two different worlds that don't collide
But when they do the crash is more like a biz-omb
Your favorite seasons bigati and mines is summer
You use credit I rubber band wrap my hundreds
What we got in common is minimal right next to nothin'
And I think that's what's subliminally keepin' you comin'
Back to the one you been fuckin' but never thought you'd be fuckin'
How often do you think about the awkwardness of it
I know you love it to say the least
And I ain't just sayin' that contrary to some beliefs opposites attract
And my track record is something to be expected
Money cash hoes you know how it goes

(Why Me, Why Me)
Why, who would've thought

Who would have thought that something so simple would turn out to be detrimental
Now I'm feeling like I'm caught in the middle
Of this love triangle between she me and reality
Reality is tellin' us that we could never be
'Cause I come from the streets and you come from a rich family
But I don't think that your family would understand me
It's the little things you overlook when you're around me
Drugs guns bitches and needless to say
You're a pimp in your own way
Baby you're makin' it hard for me to look in your eyes and tell you to move on
I'm gone (I'm gone)
But then I'm back again
Money and good pussy's a fatal attraction for men
She hits me every night quarter past ten
And with every call her voice got a little more intense
Now we involved and it really don't make no sense
So be careful what you ask for you just might get it biaaatch!

running around in roller blades
lasted for days we had nothing to say until
suddenly he looks at me and says 'im gay!'

it suddenly seems as if my jeans are too tight to be seen
on tv, atleast cos family shows are not allowed to go down
and show a girl with a thong on, ah well, you know
she stared at me and smiled sweet and said,
'i've seen you on tv' and i said 'are you sure? my place or yours?
bed or the floor? hardcore? with or without the lights?
take of your tights' and after a long hard night i said,
'that was incredible!', she said, 'ah, it was alright,
i've had better'

Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas

No habría ni luna ni noches si yo te perdiera
Si acaso naciera otra vez y tuviera esa suerte
Yo solo estaría por ti, por volver a quererte

No te aferres en dar marcha atrás, hay heridas que se
Sanan con el tiempo y hay mentiras que no
Cubren la verdad

",No Queda Nada [Versión Balada],2004
Gisselle,"Un adiós sin un por què
La ilusión que un día se fue
Una triste soledad en mí
Y tu recuerdo sigue aquí

La pasión que ya no está
Un silencio sin final
La esperanza de volver a ti
A tener tu cuerpo junto a mí

Soñando que tu amor
Un día vendrá
Por siempre tu recuerdo

Y tu mirar
Ahora tú decides regresar
Porque no puedes olvidar
Por eso júrame

Que no es un sueño
Estar de nuevo en ti
Que fue un infierno
No volverte a ver

Que fue un abismo eterno estar
Sin ti mi vida, júrame

Que para siempre regresaste a mí
Que sigue viva la ilusión de ayer
Aún nos queda tanto por vivir, júrame

",Júrame,2005
Gisselle,"Te pasas la vida esperando que llegue
Te sueñas de blanco amada por siempre
Lo encuentras y entonces descubres
Que nada es lo que parece

Y firmas un pacto que juras eterno
Pero no se cumple jamás por completo
Y se hacen las noches eternas a solas y finges de día
Con tu rol de señora

De qué nos vale que el mundo
Se crea que somos dichosas
De qué nos vale si el alma nos llora
De qué nos vale ser esa pareja que todos celebran

De qué nos vale si son apariencias
De qué nos vale que pidan perdón si cuando
Perdonas después te traicíonan
De qué nos vale

Decides dejarlo y entonces se asusta
Promete arreglarse, te pide disculpas
Y tu que lo amas le crees como siempre
Bajas la guardia y el vuelve a ofenderte

De qué nos vale que el mundo
Se crea que somos dichosas
De qué nos vale si el alma nos llora
De qué nos vale ser esa pareja que todos celebran

De qué nos vale si son apariencias
De qué nos vale que pidan perdón
Si cuando perdonas después te traicíonan
De qué nos vale

",De Que Nos Vale,2006
Gisselle,"Dices que para olvidarte me falta un milagro
Que te amo demasiado y lo debo admitir
Que no vuelvo a enamorarme y de eso estas seguro
Que mi vida y mi futuro dependen de ti

Y te tengo que informar que estas equivocado
Hace tiempo que mi alma te ha dejado huir

Ya soy libre, libre de tus cadenas
Libre y enhorabuena porque sobreviví
Ya soy libre, libre y me siento nueva
Y no hay quién me detenga

Porque gracias a ti ya soy libre

No sé qué te hace pensar que puedo ser tan débil
Debe ser que tu autoestima anda de bajón
Deja ya de preocuparte por lo que me pase
Créeme que ahora sin ti me va mucho mejor

Chao y que te vaya bien te veo en otra vida
Porque en esta ya no quiero ni por un error

Ya soy libre, libre de tus cadenas
Libre y enhorabuena porque sobreviví
Ya soy libre, libre y me siento nueva
Y no hay quién me detenga

Porque gracias a ti ya soy libre
Porque el tiempo se llevó
Lo que quedaba de ti

Sola pa'lante y pa' arriba, sube ya soy libre

Busca quien te quiera, busca quien te atienda
Que yo no tropiezo con la misma piedra
Busca quien te cuide y quien te consienta
Y si no lo encuentras pídele a tu abuela

Busca quien te quiera, busca quien te atienda
Que yo no tropiezo con la misma piedra
Busca quien te cuide y quien te consienta
Y si no lo encuentras pídele a tu abuela

Ya soy libre, libre de tus cadenas
Libre y enhorabuena porque sobreviví
Ya soy libre, libre y me siento nueva
Y no hay quién me detenga

Porque gracias a ti ya soy libre
Porque el tiempo se llevó
Lo que quedaba de ti, ya soy libre

Y sigo igualita

Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
Sunday is gloomy on shadows, I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gitane Demone,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1994
Gitane Demone,"This is my favorite sad story,
Forget me not or I'll forget myself
I've got quite a few things that I'm afraid of
Sometimes I just can't face myself 
This is my favorite sad story,
Forget me not or I'll forget myself.
I guess I'll tuck myself away tonight,
You know it's been one of those days. 

Every pretty flower,
Every lovely flower,
Every deadly flower 
Hides its light inside of shame.

I do not know why you don't know,
I cannot reap what you have sown 
Beneath this blanket of loose soil,
Wrapped around my mortal coil.

Well a stem is not a rose,
But that's how my garden grows.
I can't see the forest for the trees, 
The stinking poison for disease 
Now it's all shot to hell and back again.
I seek redemption for the 
Same old sins and I fall on my knees,
And I pray that all the poppies they 
They will just fade away. 
But fields of poppies they remain.
That's how they found me last time, dead 

This is my favorite sad story,
Forget me not or I'll forget myself.
I've got quite a few things that I'm afraid of, 
Sometimes I just won't face myself. 
This is my favorite sad story, 
Forget me not or I'll forget myself
I guess I'll just tuck myself away tonight 
You know its been one of those days. 

Every pretty flower,
Every lovely flower, 
Every deadly flower, 
Hides its light inside of shame.

I do not know why you don't know,
I cannot reap what you have sown,
Beneath this blanket of loose soil,
Wrapped around my mortal coil. 

Irises lay in spring mud, 
Where lovers drown each other's sorrows,
Where lovers dream about tomorrows. 
As for me I drown another kind as 
Sadness runs course through my veins. 
Posie wreaths they crown me. 
My heart, My heart 
I should just fade away, fade away 
Like a flower",Flowers,1995

You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

Etwas ist geschehen mit dir

Wuchs zwischen uns eine Mauer aus Eis
Wir tun als wär, es noch wie es war
Aber ich fühl das Schweigen ist da
Manchmal seh ich dich an
Und such in dir den Mann der du warst damals als ich dich fand
Ich hab mit dir geträumt
Ich hab mit dir gehofft, gekämpft und gelacht und geweint
Du warst mein Kind, mein Geliebter und mein Freund
Etwas ist geschehen mit mir
Ich möchte so nicht mehr leben mit dir
Ich halte dieses Schweigen nicht aus
Ich brauch keine Villa, ich brauch ein Zuhaus
Abends schläfst Du neben mir ein
Und merkst nicht einmal, dass ich um uns wein'

Und trotzdem glaub ich nicht, dass es wahr ist
dass zwischen dir und mir nichts mehr da ist
von unserem Traum
Die Jahre, die wir beide uns gaben
Die kann man doch nicht streichen und sagen
Was wir wollten war verkehrt, Nein
Wir haben doch zusammen gehört
Es ist nie zu spät
Etwas muss geschehen mit uns
Bevor das Schweigen die Liebe zerstört

You like to see me cry.
Don't, DON'T tear me down.
Don't, DON'T tear me down.
You said nothin' lasts forever.
You were the only one I like to hold.
But now you turn to ice, your touch is cold.

You got a hold on me.

You burn me straight thru.

It's the change of heart, pulling your life apart
Change of heart
Love is here today, and it's gone tomorrow
Do we trade it straight across, trade our love for the sorrow?

It's the change of heart, pulling your life apart
Change of heart, pulling your life apart, Change of heart.

There'll be no escape, no turning back, All the broken promises, straight from the pack,
The angry flames, that burn too high, You dare to run, when there's nowhere to hide.
You've gone too far, into the raven's den You jumped the gun, and tried to defend 

The ruthless rain, that falls so hard It's there to remind you, you won't get too far.
There'll be no escape, no way out for you
Now there's no turning back, when the damage is through
Now it's all for one, and one for them all. This time they talk, still you won't fall

Choosing your friends, like champagne on ice. You're done with the vultures, and you pay the price
And now you believe, in all that you read, With your face on the cover of a magazine
Faith has failed you, you're losing control, Now you're hard like a rock, that forgot how to roll
There'll be no escape, no way out for you

Now there's no turning back, when the damage is through
Oh and there'll be no escape, no way out for you

Giulia Jean,"E anche questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù

Mi volevi diverso
Ti dicevo non cambio
Ti imbruttisce il successo
Solo se non sai indossarlo
E stavi da sola per ore
Chiusa a piangere in bagno
Eravamo un dipinto bellissimo
Sopra la tela di un ragno
Ma tu ci credevi a sta favola
I nostri sogni dentro a una scatola
Senza nemmeno poi renderci conto
Che stavamo arredando la nostra trappola
Io ti dicevo ‘non ci son speranze’
Tu non credevi nelle disgrazie
Poi il cuore si spezza in due metà intatte
E i sogni diventano realtà infrante
No, no, vado via
Finché non avrò
Nostalgia della nostalgia

E anche questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù
Mi chiedo perché a volte
Le stelle sono poche
Perché non si accendono se non le guardi tu
E adesso che non ho te
Non è che
Ho smesso di pensarci su
E anche se questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù
Ma non mi ricordo come

Questa notte nel cielo
Nemmeno una stella
Anche la luna è vuota
Non riesco a vederla
Tu vuoi essere
La mia vita
O preferisci saperla?
Ma senza rompere il guscio
Non puoi scoprire una perla
Bruciavamo nel fuoco in tre ore
Poi cadevamo nel vuoto interiore
Ora che non c’è niente che mi fa impressione
So che non andrò all’inferno ma a un piano inferiore
L’amore dà sintomi e la fama agli intipodi
Ma io amavo i tuoi pregi
E i tuoi difetti
Amavo le tue curve
E pure i tuoi spigoli

Quanto sei fredda
Adesso assideri
Il vento parla
Sento gli spifferi

E anche questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te
Che mi sorridevi quando mi vedevi giù
Mi chiedo perché a volte
Le stelle sono poche
Perché non si accendono se non le guardi tu
E adesso che non ho te

Ho smesso di pensarci su
E anche se questa notte
È un’altra, ma non ho te

Giuliano Palma,"La tele resta spenta e non la guardo più 
Ho un nodo in gola che è difficile mandare giù
Fumo un po', sposto via la tenda 
Cielo grigio piombo io non lascio che mi prenda
La nostalgia che sale lentamente come mai 
Io penso a te mi chiedo adesso 
Dove sei cosa fai chissà se tu avrai mai pensato a me 
Al nostro fuoco che bruciava e mo' è cenere

Ma tutto passa piano e pure se fa strano 
Io sorrido perché so che oggi non ti chiamerò 
Quel che viene venga e mi sta bene 
Quel che è stato è già passato e mo' il passato se lo tiene
E piove già da un tot 
La pioggia bagna la mia pelle ma mi asciugherò 
Perché so che il tempo è ciclico 
E so che un po' di tempo è quello che ci vuole 
Mentre un guaglione sta scacciando il male sta aspettando il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami risplendi e scaldami
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione

E oggi è come ieri 
Ma forse è un'impressione frutto della mente di un guaglione 
Sarà che non c'è il sole 
Sarà che tutto sembra resti uguale 
Sarà quel che sarà sono preso male 
Ma nessuno chiama e non so chi chiamare 
Cerco di schiodarmi e penso solo a quello che ho da fare 
Uh gesù gesù 
Sono io la vittima dei demoni che tornano e che vengono a tirarmi giù 
I miei cattivi pensieri che mi aspettano braccano 
Parlano e parlano 
Dove sono I raggi che scaldavano un guaglione? 
Dove sono gli altri della mia ballotta mo' che sono nel ciclone? 
In dopa trovo la mia cura in dopa mischio le radici e la cultura 
L'energia pura la musica mi detta le parole 
Caccio queste rime e so che prima o poi ritorna il sole
 
Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami risplendi e scaldami
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione

Vada come vada e va da sé 
Conto solo su di me e già so che già sai che
Un chico fa quel che s'ha da fare quando amore non c'è 
Devo imbustare perché in tasca manca money 
Sempre più difficile restare calmo in questa situazione 
Sclero 
Non ne voglio più parto da zero 
So che in qualche modo devo andare su ma
Non c'è più luce solo buio che fa male 
Non c'è più pace solo rabbia che ogni giorno sale

Got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night

Go on a nicking spree
Hit the wrong guy

How was butlins?
Were the screws too tight?
When you lot get out
Were gonna hit the town
We'll burn it fuckin' down

And I move anyway I want to go

But it's enough to make a grown man cry

Could it be that we belong together?

E nella testa c'è una città intera 
Che soffia e che respira 
Che soffre e che ti attira 
Sempre più dentro 
Sempre più al centro 
Sempre più in mezzo fino a che non lo distingui più il confine 
Tra la tua pelle e il cielo 
Tra quello che è a pezzi è quello che è intero 
La notte ha mille occhi

E mettono I ""beep"" nei vaffanculo

Sudati si chiudono gli occhi 
Si spegne l'insegna dell'ultima vita di luce 
Rubate si finge il silenzio perfetto 
L'esterno ti sembra di pace

Giuseppe Bamboschek,"In this year of Seventeen-Ninety-Two
Our conventions have been thrown all askew
And I know I'm out of date when I seek one mate
One faithful lover true

To be really in the fashion today
You must have a dozen beaux in your sway
But somehow I don't believe in the modern plan
I want to wait for just one man

(It's more fun to love 'em all)
Kiss 'em all, short and tall)

I have another scheme
It's my only dream

One kiss, one man to save it for
One love for him alone
One word, one vow, and nothing more
To tell him I'm his own
One magic night within his arms
With passion's flower unfurled
And all my life I'll love only one man
And no other man in the world

(You've been reading stories of romantic glories)
(Are you growing sad for your Galahad?)

Soon my Knight may find me
Softly steal behind me
Put me on a horse
And carry me away
Laugh all you like at me
I'll find my man, you'll see

One kiss, one man to save it for
One love for him alone
One word, one vow, and nothing more
To tell him I'm his own
One magic night within his arms
With passion's flower unfurled
And all my life I'll love only one man
And no other man in the world",One Kiss [From the New Moon],2001

Questa notte nessun dorma in Pekino!

Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
Dall'amore e di speranza!

Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun saprà!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà

Giuseppe Milici,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,
Giuseppe Milici,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",2005
Giuseppe Ottaviani,"Everyone is walking on the edge of life
Like a ghost of a shadow, barely alive
Even times in a rush
But its going nowhere

Everyones connected but no one is connecting
The human element has long been missing
Tell me, have you seen it?
Have you seen it?

Or are we alone?
'Cause I need something to believe in
Tell me, are we alone?
Where is the life? Where is the feeling?
Is anybody out there?
Is anyone listening?
Is anyone left in this whole world?
Or are we alone?
Alone

Where is the feeling?

Everybody needs to know
Somebody who cares.
Just a friendly face
You can trust to be there.
Are you afraid to be known
And not be a stranger?

Cause everyones connected but no one is connecting
The human element has long been missing
Tell me, have you seen it?

Or are we alone?

Giuseppe Verdi,"Va, pensiero, sull'ali dorate;
va, ti posa sui clivi, sui colli,
ove olezzano tepide e molli
l'aure dolci del suolo natal!

Del Giordano le rive saluta,
di Sionne le torri atterrate...
O, mia patria, sì bella e perduta!
O, membranza, sì cara e fatal!

Arpa d'or dei fatidici vati,
perché muta dal salice pendi?
Le memorie nel petto raccendi,
ci favella del tempo che fu!

O simile di Sòlima[10] ai fati
traggi un suono di crudo lamento,
o t'ispiri il Signore un concento
che ne infonda al patire virtù","Va, Pensiero",1996

Tra milioni di poesie ma
Trovo solamente

Che leggerai attento senza mai comprendere

E I miei baci in grandine

Io non so dove sono, e là fuori com’è 
Non ho mai visto il mare dietro la tua casa 
E le mille stazioni e I maglioni e I caffè 
Di quel viaggio inatteso che ti ha portata qui 

Quante volte hai tremato dentro le tue battaglie 
Raccogliendo per strada pezzi di coraggio 
E quanti anni hai perduto dietro le meraviglie 
Tu che sai che non c’è una sola verità 

Ma da qui si può sentire 
Il tuo battito profondo 
Il primissimo respiro 
Che dà forma all’universo 
L’invisibile bellezza 

Immaginami a casa un giorno che ha piovuto 
Bagnata di risate e ancora senza fiato 
Un ramo che fiorisce in mezzo a questo niente 
La fine di ogni inverno oppure solo quando vuoi 

Immaginami il nome del più grande amore 
In faccia a chi ha paura e non ci crede più 
Immaginami un posto dove ritornare 
E il posto dove tornerò sei tu 

Era sopra una spiaggia o in un vecchio cortile 
Quando la prima volta forse mi hai inventata 
Ero io quel pensiero che ti ha reso immortale 
Oltre le tue paure oltre le bugie 

E da qui si può sentire 
Il tuo battito profondo 
Il rumore dei tuoi sogni 
Nelle nostre notti insieme 
L’impossibile carezza 

Immaginami a casa un giorno che ha piovuto 
Bagnata di risate e ancora senza fiato 
Un ramo che fiorisce in mezzo a questo niente 
La fine di ogni inverno oppure solo quando vuoi 

Immaginami pronta per disubbidire 
Per centomila volte ma non farlo più 
Immaginami un posto dove ritornare 
E il posto dove tornerò sei tu 

Ma tu ci pensi mai, dov’è la differenza 
Tra quello che hai voluto ed una coincidenza? 
È quella tentazione di provare ancora a vivere
È solo amore 
È solo amore 

Se tutto l’infinito entra in una mano 
E non abbiamo scelto di essere qualcuno 
Immaginami un punto sopra un foglio bianco 
Che aspetta le parole che domani troverò 
Nell’aria gelida di un’alba prima di partire 
Nell'attimo che ti assomiglierò di più 
Immaginami un posto dove ritornare 
E il posto dove tornerò 
E il posto dove tornerò 
E il posto dove nascerò 
Sei tu

Storm stained city streets 
Paved with pain 
To bring these roses to you 
And with sore throat insecurity 
You pulled the thorns 
From my bleeding side 
There were winter days 
Spent in,sulking, side 
Try to heat cold sheets 
Hide allergy eyes

I'm now hanging out with destiny 
And begging it to get the best of me 
What else can I do? 
Why do you read me 
Like no one else? 
Used to live headaches 
Now they're somewhere else

We are handguns, angel
Waiting to explode

But now we know 
The sun may hide 
But the night is always there 
So don't anticipate 
It's not worth the wait

What did you expect?

See there's this voice 
Dragging me down 
Die young, or live forever?

And in a world of sluts, we keep this wet dream alive
Yeah, our drought is drying out
You go nowhere in a nowhere town and no one's listening to the sound
Of breaking down and breaking out is just wishful thinking

We're taking walks around the hearts and homes we'll never own

Of breaking down and breaking out is just wishful thinking

And I am coming clean of dreams that don't exist
Oh God, it's in the air when it should be
Safe between our hands
""And love, even without light I could see that we would fail""
Let me say what I mean
Let me sleep on your floor

Through bruised bones, barely hiding my mind

Fever burns- choke on words at the thought of you

Sing a song for the disenchanted
Hum a hymn for the misdirected
A little love for the sons and daughters
Shadow-sitting life in forgotten corners
(and then)
I fell hard over myself again
I confess my love for everything
I woke up and needed to sleep again

Goddamn the yesterdays
With the love of all there is to love

I've got reasons for everything, everything except this
We could be the b-side to the hit song without no soul
We could sound like things were fine and find out they weren't at all
We could go back to where we was, live life and feel so small
Back where we started which was nowhere at all

It's been too long since the last time we felt alive
We're digging our own graves- we're damning our own prayers

but they're too deaf for honesty
And these are lives the world would lead,
but they're against injury

When you see it coming after you don’t hide
Can you feel it collide with your night?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Build em up, break them down into dust
And it convinced me to make that drive
Take that fall, open the window enough
And for a while I was crying loud
Bleeding out, wishing my way through the dark

I fuck, some fuck, fuck up some comma

Would we pay attention to real fucking issues instead

Would I still be selling out shows every night
Would they all believe in the hype
Regardless of image
I'm askin' would people still love me despite
I'd still be right here in these shoes 'cause I fit 'em I worked for this life yeah
Three hundred and sixty five nights, eleven years straight
Let 'em debate
We finally broke through
But it's far worse to happen never than late
So settle it straight
I worked for years and studied the game

All bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money, minor do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah
Walked up to my ride, asked me could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats, then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said, ""Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store and sell a couple million""

Said, ""I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like""
She said, ""My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life""
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah them niggas started bussin'
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
She said, ""Nigga hit the gas,"" went from zero to a hunnid
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin' out the window with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb
And ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard
And she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like ""What is this?""
And then we looked up and a light came down

Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lapdance
With a lit match in your left hand, and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up

I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
Nah, nigga, nah nigga

Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow?
Ayy fuck that, we gotta go, wouldn't even be in this ho
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it

Glad,"In these days of confused situations
In this night of a restless remorse
When the heart and the soul of a nation
Lay wounded and cold as a corpse

From the grave of the innocent Adam
Comes a song bringing joy to the sad
Oh, your cry has been heard and the ransom
Has been paid up in full, be ye glad

Oh, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Every debt that you've ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord
Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad

So be like lights on the rim of the water
Giving hope in a storm sea of night
Be a refuge amidst the slaughter
Of these fugitives in their flight

For you are timeless and part of a puzzle
You are winsome and young as a lad
And there is no disease or no struggle
That can pull you from God, be ye glad

Oh, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Every debt that you ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord
Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad

Oh, be ye glad
Oh, be ye glad
Every debt that you ever had
Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive

Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

Would we? 
Could we?

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.

Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain,2000

Of two empty lives

Suddenly arrives

Of what might have been

Scattered in the wind

Together
We belong together
Never was that one lovely word
Easier to say

Knowing the love of your life
Will never come again

The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn

For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting,
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter,
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

The glue I bought
So you could mend my favorite dish

Oh, the broken vase
I once threw at you and missed
And this is love
A story of love

Your checkered handkerchief
The one I used when my kitten died
And birthday cakes
A box of tunes, a TV guide

Ah, catching cold
Trudging through the rain for a mile
To get some special gifts
For your sister and her child

And that little dream house
That sits up on that sunny hill
And all the dreams we had that
This house our kids would one day fill

And this is love, oh, and this is love
Don't you know, that this is love?
The story of love, glory of love

A birthday party for Lorraine
And drinking too much pink champagne
The hand that struck through jealousy
And broke the ties between you and me

A little heart that would not forget
And wondering how I'm gonna live
With nothing left but hurt and pain
Try and try and try again

And this is love, oh, and this is love
Don't you know that this is love?
The story of love

A snapshot pasted to my mind
Of all the things I've left behind
A book of poems, a favorite record
And how you used to cheat at checkers

The tree that spied on our first kiss
That old broken, broken dish
Whoa, all of these things I truly miss
But don't you know, don't you know

That this is love, oh, and this is love
Don't you know that this is love?

Too much bubbling pink champagne
Nothing left but hurt and pain
Maybe a poem and one or two records
Can't nobody beat you
When you're cheating at checkers

Gladys Knight & the Pips,"I heard church bells ringing,
I heard a choir singing.
I saw my love walk down the aisle.
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

Cloud of loneliness I feel like I'm dead

I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, boy

And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting,
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter,
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

It's all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon somehow
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born",When a Child Is Born,1980

A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground

Waiting for one child

Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

Everybody the good old days 
The good old days 
Well, let's talk about the good old days 
Come to think about it 
As bad as we think they are 
These will become the good old days of our children 
Why don't we try to remember 
The kind of September 
When life was slow and oh so mellow 
Try to remember 
And if you remember 
Then follow 
Why does it always seem the past is better 
We look back and think 
The winters were warmer 
The grass was greener 
The skies were bluer 
The smiles were brighter 
Can it be that it was all so simple then 
Or has time rewritten every line 
And if we had the chance to do it all again 
Tell me 
Would we? 
Could we? 

Memories like the corners of my mind 
Memories 
Misty watercolor memories 
Of the way we were 
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind 
Smiles we gave to one another 
For the way we were 

Oh can it be that it was all so simple then 
Or has time rewritten every line 
And if we had the chance to do it all again 
Tell me 
Would we? 
Could we? 

Memories may be beautiful and yet 
What's too painful to remember 
We simply choose to forget 
So it's the laughter we'll remember 
We'll remember

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Gladys Knight & the Pips,"I just wanna be happy
To love and be loved by you

But the only time I'm happy
Is when I dream of you each night
'Cause that's the only time
You hold me tight in my dreams
Is the only time your love is mine

Each time you're near
Something happens to my heart
You make you feel so unwanted, dear
And it pains my poor heart
If I could feel your sweet caress
Then I'd know true happiness

But the only time I'm happy
Is when I dream of you each night
'Cause that's the only time
You hold me tight in my dreams
Is the only time your love is mine

To me you'll never have
Nothing kind or sweet to say
Than my whole day
To seem too sadly waste away
But when the day ends
All my happiness begins

But the only time I'm happy
Is when I dream of you each night
'Cause that's the only time
You hold me tightly in my dreams
Is the only time your love is mine

Life pasts each day
Leaving loneliness in my heart
You make you feel so unneeded
And it hurts my poor heart
But there's nothing I'd rather do
Than to be happy loving you

But the only time I'm happy
Is when I dream of you each night
'Cause that's the only time
You hold me tightly in my dreams
Is the only time your love is mine

Gladys Knight & the Pips,"I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said good-bye
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry
And I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty girl in town
They danced with me
And while I held them
All I did was to talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you
No girl who's in my little red book
Just ever could replace your love
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of
Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can you be?
I need you so much
All I do is to talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no, no

Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can you be?
I need you so much
All I do is to talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no, no

All I do is to talk, talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no, no

All I do is to talk, talk, talk
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you",Overnight Success,2013
Gladys Knight & the Pips," ray of hope flickers in the sky 
A tiny star lights up way up high 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn', 
This comes to pass when a child is born. 
A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees 
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn, 
This comes to pass when a child is born. 
A rosy dawn settles all around
You got to feel you're on solid ground 
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn 
This come to pass when a child is born. 
It's all a dream, an illusion now.
It must come true some time soon somehow 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn 
This comes to pass when a child is born",When a Child Is Born (Soleado),2013

Gladys Palmer,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin

Gladys Swarthout,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine","Begin the beguine, song (from ""Jubilee"")",2006
Gladys Swarthout,"I get up in the evening 
And I ain't got nothing to say 
I come home in the morning 
I go to bed feeling the same way 
I ain't nothing but tired 
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself 
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help 

You can't start a fire 
You can't start a fire without a spark 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 

Message keeps getting clearer 
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place 
I check my look in the mirror 
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face 
Man I ain't getting nowhere 
I'm just living in a dump like this 
There's something happening somewhere 
Baby I just know that there is 

You can't start a fire 
You can't start a fire without a spark 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 

You sit around getting older 
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me 
I'll shake this world off my shoulders 
Come on baby this laugh's on me 

Stay on the streets of this town 
And they'll be carving you up alright 
They say you gotta stay hungry 
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight 
I'm dying for some action 
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book 
I need a love reaction 
Come on now baby gimme just one look 

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Gladys Swarthout,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2006
Gladys Swarthout,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night","In the still of the night, song (from ""Rosalie"")",2006
