Savage Garden,"Here I go again  I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today 
It's been seven months and counting 
You've moved on 
I still feel exactly the same 
It's just that everywhere I go all the buildings know your name 
Like photographs and memories of love 
Steel and granite reminders 
The city calls your name and I can't move on 

Ever since you've been gone 
The lights go out the same 
The only difference is 
You call another name 
To your love 
To your lover now 
To your love 
The lover after me 

Am I all alone in the universe? 
There's no love on these streets 
I have given mine away to a world that didn't want it anyway 
So this is my new freedom 
It's funny I don't remember being chained 
But nothing seems to make sense anymore 
Without you I'm always twenty minutes late 

Ever since you've been gone 
The lights go out the same 
The only difference is 
You call another name 
To your love 
To your lover now 
To your love 
The lover after me 

And as time goes by so slowly 
The nights are cold and lonely 
I shouldn't be holding on 
But I'm still holding on for you 

Here I go again, I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today 
But I'm standing at your doorway 
I'm calling out your name because I can't move on 

Ever since you've been gone 
The lights go out the same 
The only difference is 
You call another name 
To your love 
To your lover now 
To your love 
The lover after me",The Lover After Me,1999
Savage Garden,"And she takes another step
Slowly she opens the door
Check that he is sleeping
Pick up all the broken glass
And furniture on the floor
Been up half the night screaming
Now it's time to get away
Pack up the kids in the car
Another bruise to try and hide
Another alibi to write
Another lonely highway
In the black of night

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

And there are children to think of
Baby's asleep in the back seat
Wonder how they'll ever make it
Through this living nightmare
But the mind is an amazing thing
Full of candy dreams and new toys
And another cheap hotel
Two beds and a coffee machine
But there are groceries to buy
And she knows she'll have to go home

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

Another bruise to try and hide
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Silent fortress built to last
Wonder how I ever made it",Two Beds and a Coffee Machine,1999
Savage Garden,"Cool breeze and autumn leaves 
Slow motion daylight 
A lone pair of watchful eyes 
Oversee the living 
Feel the presence all around 
A tortured soul 
A wound unhealing 
No regrets or promises 
The past is gone 
But you can still be free 
If time will set you free 

Time now to spread your wings 
To take to flight 
The life endeavor 
Aim for the burning sun 
You'll be trapped inside 
But you can still be free 
If time will set you free 
But it's a long long way to go 

Keep moving way up high 
You see the light 
It shines forever 
Sail through the crimson skies 
The purest light 
The light that sets you free 
If time will set you free 
Sail through the wind and rain tonight 
You're free to fly tonight 
And you can still be free 
And going higher than mountain tops 
And go high the wind don't stop 
And go high 
Free to fly tonight 
Free to fly tonight",You Can Still Be Free,1999
Savage Garden,"I ride this train in the wind-swept afternoon
And the sunlight warms the faces of the faithless who are waiting
I ride this train, but I need a conversation
Mozambique or was it Veronique, but
You pick the subject, and I'll listen to you

(People tell me that I feel too much) 
But I don't care, I don't care
(People tell me that I need too much) 
But I don't care; no, I don't care

I ride this train in a dream like state of mind
Through a field of frozen memories, imagination racing
I ride this train, but I need to make connections
No, I wasn't staring, I was only trying
To get some substance, to get some meaning

(People tell me that I feel too much) 
But I don't care; no, I don't care
(People tell me that I need too much)
But I don't care; no, I don't care

Oh no, 'cause I don't care; no, I just don't care anymore

Savage Garden,"Well you know every time I look at that expression printed on the page I think I hear you,
Whispering the magic and the compliments I need so badly
So baby come on, yeah, so baby come on
Now I've been running circles around the notion that you'd find me baby, One day maybe.
But all the physic powers of suggestion I've been sending your way, 

So can't you hear me say?
I want your arms all around me,
I want your face, yeah, all around me,
I want your perfume, all around me,
I like the way you move,
And do the funky groove.

I want your arms all around me,
I want your face, yeah, all around me,
I want your perfume, all around me,
I like the way you move,
And do the funky groove. 

Like cold chardonnay chilled for a day,
Your smooth and crisp and on display.
Like Cartier, Armani, like TAG, Gucci, Versace.
In the middle of the night you're a kiss so long.
You're the only good thing when all is wrong.
You're a magic time reversal clock.
You're the fries on the side with a cherry on top.
You're sleek, velvet, gold lame, patent leather, enchante.
You're a legend, you're a glamor queen.
God I'm running out of words but you know what I mean... 

All around me I want you.
All around me I need you.
All around me I want you, 

So can't you hear me say?
I want your arms all around me,

Savage Garden,"You know every once in a while
I shoot the breeze I spend my time
I talk about silly things
I like to talk about Jesus Christ

'Cause I wonder what would happen if he passed you by
Would you be scared? Would you believe in him?
Would you bust your asses to get him institutionalized?
Well, I bet he'd be cool; I bet he'd be damn good looking

I bet that he smelt divine
I'm not talking about Calvin Klein's Obsession
Just one of those people smell good all the time
There's no reason why

What would he wear? Would he wear Tommy Hilfiger?
Or prefer Urban Outfitted? I don't think so
Well, I bet he liked Gaultier
But you'd never find him in it; I bet he liked Gaultier

Lord I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction
You know every once and a while

I shoot the breeze I spend my time
I talk about silly things
And tonight I'd like to talk to you about Jesus Christ
'Cause I wonder how we'd deal if He just passed you by

I bet he'd be a star
I bet my star wars figures he would be a movie star
A Quentin Tarantino next-big-thing
Prima Donna, then he'd appear on Oprah

You know what? I don't think so
I bet my speeder bike he'd turn his back on all of that
Lord I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction

I need your protection spend some time in my direction
Some people have just got it
You know like standing next to Elvis Presley
Well then multiply that feeling by 1 million

And you know what I'm talking about
Well I'll bet he was cool
Man I bet that cowboy was so damn good looking",I'll Bet He Was Cool,1999
Savage Garden,"Get me through the heart of the freeway
I got to see the lights up in New York city
I'm so close I think I can hear the sound of the taxi siren symphony
Don't you want to feel amazing?
Baby you know I do
You'll get back ten times what you give freely
Like my mamma told me

Love can move you take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life

Climb into the heart of the subway
Creepin' like a snake into New York city
I'm so close I think I can see those lights
Let the sun get closer to the ground
Don't you want to feel amazing?
Baby you know I do
You'll get back ten times what you give freely
Like my mamma told me

Love can move you take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life

It's about the one thing
It's about the one thing
About the kind of shoes your wearin'
About religion

And I breathe the love you've given
And I feel the love you've hidden
And though it's cold down here well I can honestly say
I can still stay

That love can move you
Love can move you, baby
Love can move you
That love can move you too child

Love can move you take you deeper every time

And I feel the love you've hidden

Savage Garden,"I wait in the darkness.
Frozen winds surround my face.
In the cover of darkness I can make believe it's you.
I feel you like the rain, I feel you like a storm cloud building in my heart.
I wonder if you know the pain, to want the one thing you haven't got.

Just a twist in time and you could be mine
Just a sip of wine and you could be mine
Just a kiss divine

A hand brushes by my love.
A smile fuels a steel inferno
You don't have to die to leave my world.
Stand still and you've departed.
It seems I'm now on your mind and I'm wasting my time. 

I'm just a fool to believe.
In the death of the night can you feel me inside?
I wish that you could conceive..

Just a twist in time and you could be mine
Just a sip of wine and you cloud be mine
Just a kiss divine and you could be mine

Won't you leave me in the darkness.
Take away the pride, all the dignity that's burning inside.
Can't you see I'm standing naked.
I'll bear all the crosses and the crucifixes you can provide.
If you could decide.

Just a twist in time and you could be mine
Just a sip of wine and you cloud be mine
Just a kiss divine and you could be mine",Mine,1999
Savage Garden,"Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes,
I think I found my best friend
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only the sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see
The missing pieces I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life

Savage Garden,"She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside, guess she knows
From the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one, they're saying

Mama never loved her much and
Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection, but
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come

And she'll say to him (she's saying)

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?

She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind 
All her friends, they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying, love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars

What a pleasant dream (just saying)

Slowly she opens the door
Check that he is sleeping
Pick up all the broken glass
And furniture on the floor
Been up half the night screaming
Now it's time to get away
Pack up the kids in the car
Another bruise to try and hide
Another alibi to write
Another lonely highway
In the black of night

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

And there are children to think of
Baby's asleep in the back seat
Wonder how they'll ever make it
Through this living nightmare
But the mind is an amazing thing
Full of candy dreams and new toys
And another cheap hotel
Two beds and a coffee machine
But there are groceries to buy
And she knows she'll have to go home

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

This is what you get when you mess with love
A morning in darkness
The eyes of a storm
Suffering, straight from the gods
No medicine, no, no drugs

This is what you get when you mess with love

We gave you life to see if you'd disobey
Not interested in what we have to say
You mess with love when you go out tonight
Doesn't matter who's wrong or right
All you want is that feeling again
When someone is camping in your head
Look right, look left, what a distress
I saw a no become a yes

This is what you get when you mess with love
I mess with love, I mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with love

Look for adventure
To be free, why not me?
Stay down, crawl down
Don't say you're innocent
Or you'll dry out like a raisin in the sun

Bedeutet, ich bin immer noch derselbe, nur der Bart ist neu
Bruder, vergiss mal diesen ganzen neuen Kinderkram
Mit so viel Talent wie wir beide im kleinem Finger haben
Wir teilen uns den Kuchen und ihr Wichser kriegt nix
Habibi, ja, es ist wie es ist

Es ist alles noch beim Alten
Und ihr werdet uns nicht los, wir machen weiter bis wir kalt sind
Rap die Suppe, wir das Salz drin
Bruder, es ist alles noch beim Alten
Und du sagst, „Bitte, bitte nicht schon wieder diese zwei Gestalten!“
Du die Wunde, wir das Salz drin
Dicka, es ist alles noch beim Alten

Hab' 'n Falken-ähnlichen Blick auf den Rest
Zieh die Strippen, jetzt in 'ner Rüstung, die golden schimmert und glänzt
Sie finden keinen Frieden, hängen wie Fliegen fest im Spinnennetz
Ihres Imageraps, in der Hoffnung, dass sich der Fame erzwingen lässt
Mir nur drohen, meinen Thron zu stürzen, genügt nicht wirklich
Ollen, die ihr wollt, sind lieber mit dem Typen über vierzig
Hashtag Fakten, haben geackert für die Batzen
Wuchsen über uns hinaus, aber wir werden nicht erwachsen
Wer hat was gesagt? Bin ertaubt, doch nicht wegen dem Alter
Die beste Zeit deines Lebens ist bei mir lediglich Alltag
Stanni hoch tausend, quatsch mal weiter von Money, Münchhausen
Oldschool, Essah der Tyrannosaurus, guck

Es ist alles noch beim Alten
Und ihr werdet uns nicht los, wir machen weiter bis wir kalt sind

Du die Wunde, wir das Salz drin
Dicka, es ist so

Wir haben im Bunker schon regiert, den Untergrund rasiert
Sie haben uns analysiert, studiert und dann ungeniert kopiert
Guck, ihr rappt alle wegen ihm und wegen mir
Rappen können sie ja, schade, dass es niemand interessiert
Seine Mama gönnt nicht mal
Ihr wart auf Aggro, ihr habt Optik geschoben
Der erste Schock ist verflogen, doch immer noch sind wir oben
Rapper sind Angsterfüllt, hocken am Boden, Hoffnung verloren
Hören den Lockruf des Todes, high von der doppelten Dosis
Mein Lieber, träum mal weiter, alles, was du haben möchtest, hatt' ich schon
Du bist mein Klon, also quatsch nicht so und wasch den Thron
Damals mit den Jungs draußen auf'm Hof
Heut hat der Straßenjunge Haus und Boot, doch

Und das Gleiche will ich auch von meinem Gegenüber
Doch ich guck' ihn an und seh' 'n Lügner, he, von wegen „Brüder“
Ich hab' zu wenig Blut für zu viele Mücken
Wenn ich nicht aufpass', end' ich noch mit einer Kugel im Rücken
Das ist schon lange nicht mehr lustig und so langsam wird es schmutzig
Du lässt mich fallen, denn ich nutz' nichts

Wir brauchen nicht zu tun, als ob wir Freunde sind
Dieses Gelaber und Drama ohne Grund sind nicht neu für mich
Wir hingen bei meinen Eltern zuhause, aßen am selben Tisch
Hinterm Rücken erzählst du, ich wär' 'ne Quelle zum Geld für dich
Einmal auf „Kontakte“ und sperren, keine Aussprache
Was du sagst, interessiert mich wie bei Menschen die Hautfarbe, null
Es lässt mich aufatmen, ein Ballast weniger
Leute wollten mich manipulieren wie Hassprediger
Never mit mir, guck, wir können gerne lachen und chillen
Doch kommentier nicht mein Privatleben, ich mach', was ich will
Lass' ma' die Filme, ich hör' nicht, was und ob du redest
Der nächste, den ich cutte, stell dich hinten an wie bei 'ner Polonese

In einem kleinen Bunker da in Westberlin
Mussten diese beiden Jungs sich den Respekt verdienen
Damals waren wir leider nur wie Dreck für die
Heut gehen sie beiseite, wenn die Haie durch das Becken ziehen
Auf Augenhöhe wie die Sonne da am Horizont
Ihr habt schon verloren, als ob 'ne Bombe angeflogen kommt
Du bist jetzt auch ein Rapper, super, du Hippie
Aber wir zwei sind die Wiedergeburt von Tupac und Biggie, verstehste?
Genau um zehn, Hip-Hop geht nicht ohne anzugeben
Und du darfst nicht reden, ohne meinen Penis anzubeten
Geiles Leben, knallharte Champagnerfeten
Rotwein aus Bretagne-Reben, alles handverlesen
Ja, ich geb' dir recht, Rap ist nicht neu
Aber sag mir bitte, warum soll es weg, wenn es läuft, Bruder?
Heute gab es wieder leckeres Zeug
Das ist der Grund, warum ich breit bin, 16 zu 9, gib ihn

Immer unterwegs, Hunger treibt uns an
Das Becken reicht nicht für alle
Ihr seid nur kleine Fische
Ihr könnt den Hai nicht ficken
Immer unterwegs, Hunger treibt uns an
Das Becken reicht nicht für alle
Ihr seid nur kleine Fische

Dicka, was für ein Wettbewerb, es steht hundert zu eins
Deutschrap-Abend im KitKat, ich nehm' dich Hund an die Leine
Lass' dich entjungfernen, als wär' dein Mund eine Scheide, bitte tu ma' nicht auf Beef mit uns
Guck aufs Cover, du redest hier mit zwei hungrigen Haien
Untergrund-Lines mit den Verkäufen von Trachten-Mucke
Hoffe, Tauben picken dir die Augen aus wie den Stiefschwestern des Aschenputtels
Stimmt, Newcomer recherchieren, was Royal Bunker ist
Hören das hier und heften sich an unsre Fersen wie Butterfische
Bilderbuchkarriere, unnachahmlich, Platten alle Kult
Und jede Line fickt dein Leben automatisch wie Buddy Wolfe
Hate, bis du stirbst, nix mit rational
Ich würd' 'nen Finger amputieren, wenn ich wüsste, dass es etwas bewirkt
Nenn' mein nächstes Album Blue Channel, denn es wird gebumst
Spritz 'ner Inderin ins Face und du kämst nicht auf den Punkt
Feinde werden filetiert und leben weiter als Sushi, das ist leicht
Wie gegen sie, Hai gegen Wuppi, arr-rrahh

Immer unterwegs, Hunger treibt uns an

Wir riechen ihr Blut und schmecken ihre Angst
Besser, du probierst aus unsrem Revier zu fliehen
Ganz egal, was du tust, hör auf, solang du noch kannst

Drizzy Drake ruft mich an „Dicka, Quentin hat gekündigt

Die fünfte Dimension, ich verlasse meinen Körper
Chakren sind auf Dauerfeuer wie syrische Mörser
Rauche Mona Lisa, plane, wie ich meine Feinde brech' und ficke
Spitte und die Luft wird dünner jetzt als Kylies echte Lippen

Es gibt noch keinen Grund für uns, von Bord zu gehen
Da ist noch Platz auf dem Regal, auf dem die Orden stehen

Deine Platte ist 'ne Frechheit, jetzt reicht's
Drecksbeats, Dreckslines, Brechreiz
Und deine Worte, ich zweifel' an der Echtheit
Auch die Uhr, die du trägst, muss aus Blech sein
Und du fragst dich, warum bei mir läuft, Bestzeit
Nimm's dir nicht zu Herzen, Dicka, that's life
Mein Lehrer sagte, ich werd' nie perfekt sein
Aber Wunder gibt es immer wieder, Katja Ebstein
Aus dem Holz wurde Platin
Jogginghose, Bomberjacke, goldener Ferrari
AMK, darauf roll' ich mir 'n Hasi
Allerfeinste Ware, dicke Knollen wie Kohlrabi
An die Spitze aus'm Royal Bunker, mein Weg
Ich kam davon mit einem blauen Auge, 3D
Doch manchmal plagt mich dieses Heimweh
Mein Herz im Viertel wie Mirácoli und Eistee
Darum ist der Bruder blau wie Curaçao
Egal, wie teuer, Dicka, Hauptsache, der Puma drauf

Darf mir einen lutschen, HDGDL

Und eure Fehler sind egal, weil mich das nicht intressiert
Das ist mir alles nicht so wichtig wir ihr, das stimmt
Lass sie mich nicht respektieren, nicht mehr lieben und feiern
Sie können mich nie brechen, Hauptsache, du bleibst an meiner Seite
Und niemand hält mich fern von dir, gleich, welche Strecke uns trennt
Fühl' mich daheim, allein schon wenn ich an dich denk', es stimmt

Machen auf der Bühne auf Tae-Bo-Fighter

Bis eines Tages meine Seele aus dem Fenster fliegt, eh
Und du willst dann noch ein Huhn mit mir rupfen
Doch ich kann dir nur anbieten, meine Schuhe zu putzen
Um mich aufzuhalten, musst du besser Kugeln benutzen
Keine Gegner, alles Huren und Nutten
Und dann hör' ich diesen Song
Und da disst er mich, denn mein Erfolg macht ihm schlechte Laune
Ist okay, doch lass die Mutter aus'm Spiel

Kein Strich durch die Rechnung, durchlöcher' sie mit der Schere
Was der Unterschied ist? Ich trau' mich nicht ma' zu protzen

What's inside your head

If from this distance
No one sees them fall

Is the dark your father

When I'm there in bed
I lie there wondering
Where do you lay your head
And do you say your prayers anymore?
And do you say your prayers?

Damien
Is your heart harder
Do you still feel pain
Does the night go farther
When you're sleeping in the rain

In the dark I have heard a calling
Broken wings that beg to fly
Is there time or is it too late
Is the cut flower no longer alive

There's a church aside one corner most believe was always there

It was built a thousand years before any now were born
And its glory was its belfry with its stones all gray and worn

Now there's a gargoyle on that belfry and he's been up there for years
And he has watched and he has pondered: ""What is laughter, what are tears?""

And he's never found his answers as he sees the years go by
But he watches and he wonders with his stone unblinking eyes",Sarajevo,1995

And if the ground's been stained, colors run in the rain

Run away, no delay do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there

We never contemplate, we only offer fate

And as he stood there cursing fate
For making life so hard
It seemed that fate had listened
For she dealt another card

For arriving in the harbour
Silhouetted against the sky
Was a ship bound for america
And her name, ""maersk dubai""

And so when no one else was looking
And the ship was safely moored
He waited for his moment
Then he quickly snuck on board

Then he found himself a hiding place
Between two crates of iron ware
And as for distant america
In his mind he was already there

But what he was unaware of
As they sailed away from shore
Was that there were other stowaways
And he was one of four

And meanwhile the old sailor
Had walked right past that pier
While still conversing with the ocean
On the strengths of his idea

And as he walked he came upon
A youth he thought asleep
But the ocean said that he was not
And brushed a wave against his feet

And when the young man didn't stir
But lay quite still instead
The sailor took a closer look
And saw that he was dead

And all around the body
Was something he had never seen
Little cellophane packages
Marked ""blackjack guillotine""

And so he asked the ocean
What these strange packets were

And she answered they held the heroin

That in his blood the youth had stirred

And it is certainly a sign
That things have gotten out of hand
When one can purchase ones own death
And choose it by the brand",Another Way,1998

Don't want to look across the waves
Instead of seeing hills of water

To look across an empty sky
For a forgotten childhood reason
To once more wish that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again
There's a god does he remember when
We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And in the night he sees the ocean
Carve its thoughts upon the shore
For in the way it was created
It can do this and nothing more

And every message it would leave him
The next wave carefully erased
As the tears that passed between them

Were so real that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again

We were young and faith was not pretend

There'd be a time when men would all be wiser
When everyone, everyone,

Yes everyone is

Saved

And as he walked away he thought about

That third stowaway once more
And wondered if the body had washed up

Upon some far and distant shore

Or if it sank down through the depths
Of cold reality
To rest upon the ocean floor
For all eternity

For at the bottom of the sea

The sailor asked how so young a man
Could have fallen into such a trap
And the ocean said the first time was with a friend
Who now can't take it back

It was a friendly gesture
As they all claim at the time
When that friend or kindly stranger
Free of charge gave him his first line

To harm this boy they're sure to say
Was never our intent
And we were as shocked as anyone
With just how far he went

He never thought it dangerous

In the dark he heard a whisper
Asking him to understand
In the desert look for water
On the ocean look for land

And there in the waves
Was a man in his grave
That he saw in the night
'Tween the flashes of light
And he

Could not be there

And all he had prayed

Or had given away
He now found to be wrong

Could not be there

Could you keep our lives together

Could you grant this last illusion

And all at once the heavens bled their fire

And suddenly the waves were reaching higher
And in the dark I thought I heard them say

Could you keep our lives together
Safely back onto the shore
Could you grant this last illusion

But what the sailor did not know
And would never learn
Was on that beach now far away
The young child had returned

And finding the broken hourglass
He reset it upright
Then placed sand from the beach inside
And placed the lid on tight

Then examining his handiwork
He left it in the sand
And then he quickly ran back home
Thinking god would understand

Everything I ever had for one more tomorrow
Everything I ever had for just one more night
And if this is not to be I pray could I borrow
Just another final hour onto my life

Did you ever really want to

Lord, tell me how it will be
Lord, tell me how it will be

Standing once more by a boat on a river
He pushes it off while he stays on the land
And seeing the hourglass now so much clearer

Which someone had refilled by hand

And somewhere that boat's now adrift on the
Ocean

The mast at full sail and there's no one on board
The hourglass no longer sits by the ocean
Only his footprints all alone on the shore
And soon they're no more
No more

No more

Now our story's nearly over
And we've reached the final scene
But we're sure that some have wondered
What had happened in-between

From the moment when the boy was saved
And their boat had reached the shore
Well, they talked about life and death

And perhaps a little more

The boy said he'd been a stowaway
Aboard the ""maersk dubai""
When the captain had him thrown to the sea
And left him there to die

At this the old sailor had stood up
His face now filled with rage
And swore that he would never rest
Until that captain had been caged

But the boy implored the sailor
That he not say a word
Because he was an illegal immigrant
And as of recently he'd heard

That going to the authorities
Could often be unwise
When one's paper were illegal
The police just might not sympathize

So when they reached the harbor
With their journey at an end
He left the boy on another ship
Whose captain was a friend

And when he saw it pull to sea
And was once more all alone
He leaned against the tiller
And turned his ship back home

Eventually he reached that beach
He'd left the night before
Then stepped a last time from the boat
And waded to the shore

Then the old man picked the glass up
That he had left behind
And headed for the small cafe
For it was nearly time

And the ocean watched him leaving
To find his lady fair
And as he left he heard her last words
Drifting in the air

That every man

Is born you see
Beneath the sword

Damocles

For young and old
Are all alive
On that next beat

On which we ride

And that beat is such
A fragile thing
In both old men
Or youthful king

And that beat

That my time isn't done

Everyone's leading
But nobody's dancing
You stand on the stage

Just to turn all alone
I have waited this way
For a lifetime of days

I can't wait for the morning sun
As I stand with the sea
And the ocean she understands

Just the man I could be

Somewhere else there's a different world

With a sun that will rise
And a moon that will take its place
In another man's eyes

And perhaps it's a better world

I have been around the world
I've pursued the moon in flight
I have read the words of Shakespeare
By a midnight arctic light

I have run between the dragon's teeth
And lived to tell the tail

And I never will forget
But I've never had a family

Now all I've loved have gone before me
And of the future I have great doubts
And though it seems I still have time left
I now feel time I can do without

And I have wondered to myself
Why should death set its own time
Is it just a final jest from fate
To add onto her other crimes?

For I have no wish to wait around
While all my senses fade
And one by one return the gifts
That youth so freely gave

Wired to some cold machine
That maps my every breath
And signals at the proper time
Less they should miss my death

And all this service I suspect
Is less done by goodwill
Than by the fear that they should miss
A final chance to bill

So I've decided to leave this world
And have devised a plan
To sail to sea in a small boat
Well out of sight of land

To sail once more upon the deep
Like a viking to his resting place
Then slip forever neath the waves
An exit with some grace

And the ship shall be my coffin
On this last voyage that I take
And my trail left through the water
Will be my final wake

I have done more than thought about this
On my life I've closed every door
I have left a will beside my bed
And the boat is there offshore

And all I ask is your assistance
When that ship is well away from the land
That you send a storm to embrace us
And take us gently in your hand

When he had finished speaking
Some points the ocean did concede
But when he said his final word
She once more disagreed

I'll think about this if I may
I need not rush the tide
For in this world of too little time
There's always time to die

You seem so eager to end this life
And with your death to dance
That you ignored his putrid breath
Now perfumed with romance

The sailor said you cannot understand
The needs or wants of men
So I'll ask you once more for your help
And I shall not ask again

Then the ocean pulled her waves back
And beckoned him stand near
And when he had stepped closer
She whispered in his ear

That every man

Is born you see
Beneath the sword

Damocles

For young and old
Are all alive
On that next beat

On which we ride

And that beat is such
A fragile thing
In both old men
Or youthful king

And that beat

Stands all alone you see

Between us

And black eternity

And though death is surely

Each man's fate
Until that time

Let each man wait

So be careful as you go through life
What you romanticize
I find such things are rarely true
And far more rarely wise

The sailor then listened carefully
And every thought was filed
And though he was still not quite convinced
He agreed to wait awhile

And meanwhile further down the beach
There stood a younger man
And he too felt the sand of time
Was running through his hands

But this youth felt they ran too fast
As he stood near a rusting dock
And heard the waves marking time
Like some relentless clock

He felt his future was not here
Of this he had no doubt

And even though he was eighteen
His time was running out",Turns to Me,1998
Savatage,"Each man has a soul
That struggles to escape
And in the shallows of his dreams
We can often see its wake

For we all have our secrets
That we all keep deep inside
Away from light, in darkest night
Where it's always safe to hide

Away from all that we should meet
Less someone else should share
That thing that hides inside our soul
That we pray was never there

And out upon that ocean
A lifetime from the shore
Miguel stood his night watch
Recalling everything he saw

For he was a deckhand
Aboard the ""maersk dubai""
He had sailed her round the world
From hamburg to sendai

But this trip had been different
More than any he had known
For on board there was an evil
And the evil had been shown

For halfway through this voyage
They had found two stowaways
That the captain had thrown in the sea
And left them to the waves

And when he tried to close his eyes
And pretend he did not know
The evil did not go away
But used the time to grow

For later on that same trip
They found a stowaway once again
But the captain soon met this one too
And brought him to the same cold end

He wondered what that boy thought inside
Before that final sleep
When water was all that was around
And his lungs had screamed breathe deep

He wondered what went through his mind
As he gasped for air
And the last moment when he prayed for help
To find nobody there

He wondered to himself
If he could have been the one
To stand up at that moment

And say this cannot be done
To stand up to the captain
And say this thing it cannot be
But there is nothing closer to god on earth
Than a captain on the sea

And he was just a deckhand
With no right to plead the case
Of this stranger in their midst
And so he kept his place

And what is done is done
And undone cannot be
And so he pushed it from his mind

And stared out across the sea",Underture,1998
Savatage,"As he stood upon the watch deck
Looking out onto the sea
It would offer no solutions
Only silent company

So he took hold of the reasons
As he tried to understand
But they offered just confusion
As they bled into his hands

Dear god
Couldn't you decide?
What should happen to a man's assassins

Dear god
Is it suicide?
I have never been a man of passions

I believe what the prophets said
That the oceans hold their dead
But at night when the waves are near
They whisper
And I hear

There are wounds that bleed inside us
There are wounds we never see
They are part of our refinements
That allow a man to be

There are wounds that bleed in silence
With aristocratic grace
There are tears we keep beside them
Never seen upon a face

Dear god
Do you think it's wise?
To remember everything that

Dear god
Could we compromise?
Or must the shadows of this night be everlasting

I believe what the prophets said

That the oceans hold their dead
As I contemplate this stand
What I do is who I am

I believe what the prophets said

That the oceans hold their dead
But at night when the waves are near
They whisper and I hear

Don't see the storms are forming
Don't see or heed the warning
Don't hear the sound of tyrants
Surrounded by the silence

Fingering your hand into curls while talking
On the phone resting on your collarbone.

You put down the phone, take me in our arms.
And I'm all alone with you my love.
And did you hear me coming?

Swell up with tears dripping down your thighs.

What's the point of living if were all just born to die.
You say why?
Why ask why?

I say ""I get fucked up.""
You say ""delusional.""
Somehow will you still open arms.

""Come with me"" you say.
We step outside to face the sun.
Yesterday I dream that it would all bend out to dust. 

Take a breath, turn around.
See the sun come through the clouds, the light alive in your eyes.
Standing here by your side of an arm under the sky.
I know I want to hold on.

The letters left on the lawn.
The shadows crawling the wall.
The mirror shatters and falls.

I've been lost for so long, no more will to carry on.
So dark and dead in the seas.
Nothing left in the end.
And to pray is to pretend.
I'm tired of trying to believe.

So can we learn to forget.
I wanna hold you again.
Can we love remember our love.

To live through the ordeal

Whether we die or live
What if the night that we met

No invitation or long lost friend
No I don't mind, I'll take you in

Now get out of my sight
So when there's no where left to go
Come back home, it's alright

One way give up or try

No hallelujah or holiday
No way to know if it's okay
No flawless figure or alibi

They rise around your back
Rolling up to the sky
So glad that you could come
Half a smile, walk away

Come back home it's alright

No I know just the thing to do
No I'll be waiting here for you

To try to find the places we used to go
Forget it all and say goodbye to the life that we know

It was only a dream, saw you staring at me
What i said to myself as I woke up to see
It was already late 10:10 in the neon green
And your number was on my right hand in red ink

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

Born on opposite coasts for the two of us both
Knowing in 20 years we would not be alone
Might have made us a pair of zen-like two-year-olds
With a couple of ring pops no need to propose

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

To be frozen in time forever we will stay

Making the highway our runway, and shifting gears.
Behind the clouds take off into the atmosphere.

Silhouetted by a hundred million burning constellations.
I'm Orion upside down,
In my arms you're Artemis,

I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?,2006
Savina,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?

You give me hope when I was hopeless
As my days fade to night

Saving Abel,"Sometime in the summer of '96
I was off on a road trip
A couple hundred bucks and a case of beer
Outside Panama City limits is where it all begins

2 a.m., I saw hazard lights
Appeared to be a dame distressed in the night
She was 5 foot 6 and damn she was built
I slammed on the brakes and got sideways and told her to get in

She said, ""Where you headed, to the city?""
I said, ""Yeah, I'm gonna have some fun""
She tossed back her hair in confidence
And said, ""Mind if I come?""

2 days later we ain't left the room
Did all in there that we could think to do
I could see she was restless, so we hit the town

Ended up at a place where the windows read
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here

Into the back she went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear
I thought, hell, I need to try and get back there
When she unzipped her pants and said, ""Lookee here""

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you

The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red is for the color we're about to paint this town
Ooh, I gotta new tattoo

One week passed, woke up a day late for work
I found my good time gone and she took my shirt
Drove by all the places that we had been
There was one where the windows read

Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here

Into the back I went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you

The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red is for the color we're 'bout to paint this town
Ooh, I gotta new tattoo

And I cannot forget
That smile when she said
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you

And my dreamin' of still sleepin'
I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it out.

Now you're gone, and I'm here,
And I feel so bitter.
Waking up alive, another day.
It never seems easy
When you're fighting, another day.
When I look at what I'm facing,
Don't know if I can take it.
I could scream out loud,
But I'm wasting my time.
This pain only reminds me, I'm still alive.

Now these feelings, they're creeping,
Like a chill crawling up my spine.
It's lonely, it's not easy,
Coming home all alone each and every night.

And as time goes by, I feel so bitter.
Waking up alive, another day.
It never seems easy
When you're fighting, another day.
When I look at what I'm facing,
Don't know if I can take it.
I could scream out loud,
But I'm wasting my time.
This pain only reminds me, I'm still alive.

Don't wake me up, if there's gonna be hell to pay.
All the weight of the world keeps pushing me down.
(pushing me down)
So, just let me sleep,
Even if I'm in too deep.
Keep me locked in my dreams,
So I can't get out. (I can't get out)

It's been so hard, but I'm doing much better.
Waking up alive, another day.
It never seems easy
When you're fighting, another day.
When I look at what I'm facing,
Don't know if I can take it.
I could scream out loud,
But I'm wasting my time.
This pain only reminds me, I'm still alive.

Wish I could be there to tuck them in,

Through these eyes: red, white and blue,
I know why I'm here, still, I just wanna go home.

Running for cover, take cover my brother,
To die another day as that banner yet waves.

Hey there son, it's your time to go,
I'm so proud, more than you'll know,
But freedom ain't free and now you're just like me.

Savoir Adore,"Even when the night comes
After all the setting suns
You're still the glowing one, aren't you?
Even on our worst days
When love was stripped away
You always made it stay, didn't you?

I still feel our fragments rush
Into each other, keeping us
On the edge of ecstasy
A place where we are constantly

Beating hearts from the start
So combined that they can't be torn apart
We will stay in this way
Here together 'cause we know there's no other way

Two bodies now aligned
Twin thoughts into different minds
I can't imagine time without you
No matter what song we sing
I feel everything
Anything that hurts you hurts me too

Give me every tragedy
I want it all, every little piece
Fold the mould in two-by-two
Shedding aches for truth
In a shape that's new

Beating hearts from the start
So combined that they can't be torn apart
We will stay in this way
Here together 'cause we know there's no other way

I feel it when you're near me
And when you say my name
Our pulses merge to one
They beat the same

Beating hearts from the start
We can bleed but we'll never be be torn apart

Strange but true
In our bodies, we will find it
Something new
Who we are now, we will finally love

TASTE AND TRY SAVOY BROWN

My mother told me
When I was young
Many people try
To con you son
You got to separate
The truth from the lies
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

The army man says
Sign on for five
The army show you
A real man's life
You know I don't dig
That army jive
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

My woman looks at me
My woman says
Now pack your bags boy
And get out of my bed
Five long years
You still ain't done me right
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

Now this is my life
It's the way I be
May not suit you
But it sure suits me
You got to live before you die
Taste and try

And my nights are shaded blue
My face is lined with worry
And my mind is split in two

Who's last real hope is gone

Didn't teach me right from wrong

And I need a little something

Ain't got time to think twice
Wanna keep on the ball
Then you got to pay the price

By looking at the past
And there ain't nobody out there
Who you can stop and ask

Oh, I need a little something

Some people think, oh yes they do
They found the way
But they're a dime a dozen
You can see them everyday
Some people are happy
In their delusions
Oh, I wish sometimes
I could share, I could share their illusions

But nobody really knows
What this life is all about
Those who think they do
Are the ones who should have doubts
Sometimes I wonder
What they are going to do
When their cozy dreams are shattered
And reality shows through

Savoy Brown,"This is a story 'bout a poor girl, a story that you ought to know 
She lived all alone in a one room flat on a street where the lights are low 
Every night about the same time she'd go and put her glad rags on 
Go to the place where everyone goes to Boogaloo all night long 

She's a poor girl 
Born and raised in the country she got tired of pushing a plow 
She take my train to the city and mother you should look at her now 
With her rattlesnake boots, elephant bag, genuine crocodile hat 
Around her neck to top it off she even wears a persian cat 

She's a poor girl 
That was the story of the poor girl but now she uses her head 
She's back home working on the land instead of playing in bed 
The fast life she was living took her as it's prey 
Now she's back in the country getting fatter every day

Ain't got time for doubts or fears
Ain't got time for shallow tears
Ain't got time to bare my soul
Because I still got a hard way to go

Said that you got a losing hand
Ain't no point in you raising sand
Ain't got time to bare your soul
Because I still got a hard way to go

And it's a crying shame
That you can't lay the blame
On anybody else but yourself

Wish that you had my sympathy
You ain't got no hold on me
And my heart is getting cold
And I still got a hard way to go

And it's a crying shame
That you can't lay the blame
On anybody else but yourself

And I still got a hard way to go

I just hope the good Lord knows what this life is all about
'cause I'm in the same position as when I started out.
Now I know there's folk in hospital who are far worse than me,
Oh, but that don't mean too much when my spirit don't feel free

And I'm crying, I'm crying, hey I'm crying, hey I'm crying

Well the bouquet rocks my senses, and the blues they roll my mind,
And I'm in a strange condition and my head is hard to find.
And I just keep on searching, trying to seek my goal,
And I just keep on staying, Oh trying to find the road.

And I'm crying, and I'm crying, Hey I'm crying, hey I'm crying

Wait for the sunshine, look at the rain,
Look at my future all seem the same.
Hard to distinguish right from the wrong,
Look at my trouble coming on strong.

Only God knows, oh where my search will end,
'cause a freak don't have no money and a pauper has no friends,
And there ain't no use in worrying and there ain't no use in dying,
Oh, no use testifying there ain't no use in lying.

And I'm crying, and I'm crying, hey I'm crying, oh, I'm crying

Wait for the sunshine, look at the rain,
Look at my future all seem the same.
Hard to distinguish right from the wrong,
Look at my trouble coming on strong.

Don't worry 'bout the morning
Because the day might never come
Don't worry 'bout the future
Just stay while the night is young

Don't pretend that it's your first time
Don't pretend that it's no fun
Don't tell me 'bout your mother
Just stay while the night is young

It's so easy to relax if you try
Please don't think about the time going by
You can tell me 'bout the things on your mind
Just lie back and unwind

Just experience the moment
Instead of thinking what's to come
Can't have the fall before the summer
So stay while the night is young



",Stay While the Night Is Young,1970
Savoy Brown,"When I was a young boy
Advice I would scorn
Now I'm gettin' a little older
I know I got a lot to learn

yesterday's illusions are tomorrow's smiles
I'll look back and laugh
Baby, sometimes, in a while

(repeat twice)

and it always seems the same
And who knows what to blame
If I knew then what I know now
The mistakes I wouldn't have made...
But you can't get a sneak preview
Over what you're gonna go through
And you have to rely on your body and mind
To see the light from shade

life's the same, but time does change
Perspective of your view
You're lookin' for a mystery
But you can't find a clue

some say a man makes his life
Some say that it's fate
But when you find out what to do
Ohhh, sometimes it's too late...

Jerimiah said his peace and fell back in the road
He was shot by Coulee Reese
Who they nick-named Jack The Toad
Just across his shoulder just a little to the right
He heard the click of a 45 hammer
So he throws himself down and he hits the ground
Rolls right over and spins 'round
And with one good shot, just one good shot
He brings that villain right down
In true ""Hour Western"" manner

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
I knew Coulee, Coulee never lost his cool

A legend grew and Jack The Toad knew
To back up all the talk
One day soon, preferably noon
He's going to have to take the long walk
A poker game and a fast stake
Of these Jack was the master
But a man called Pete
At the end of a dusty dusty street
He's just about six feet
Now he just might, you know he just might
He might be a lttle faster

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
I knew Coulee, Coulee never lost his cool

I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed
It's Jack The Toad

I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed, I'll be blowed
It's Jack The Toad

Well it had to happen on a summers' day
When Jack was feeling good
But a friend of a friend, promised a friend of a friend
Promised a friend of a friend he would
But many brave men have said the same thing
Again and again and again
Now Jack, when he went out to face Pete
For the final showdown
He was just a little bit high
He'd been drinking and smoking
And he thought he was so fast
He made the last move
And that was the last move he made

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
I knew Coulee, Coulee never lost his cool

Well now he's gone but his memory lives on
In the mind of every comic strip reader
Some say weren't Jack, some say was camphor
Some say he was just a bleeder
One fact, one fact remain, always be the same
Now on your way through life
Sometimes you just got to be a little bad
I knew Jack and, my goodness, he was bad
He was bad, bad news
You just got to be a little bad because, if you ain't
The great gun fighter in the sky
Ain't got no one to save
And if you're just a little bad
Just a little bad
Nobody forgets your name

Bad, bad news, he was bad, bad news
Bad, oh my goodness, Jack was bad news

As the mornings mists were clearing I could set my course
There were nineteen souls came in on foot, while one man rode a horse
And the nineteen ragged souls, the battles they had fought

Sometimes I fell like a ghost that's died of fright

Came down from the moon and up with the light of the sun
Yes the Boogie Brothers got to be in town tonight

Most times I feel like a whole that's dropped in half

Well my daddy never drank no whiskey
He never wet his liver with gin
My momma said she loved nobody else
But she really loved the drinking man

Respectable though my daddy was
Until he heard of mama's sin
He drank every drop of liquor in this place
And we never saw my daddy again

Because everybody loves a drinking man
Everybody loves a drinking man

Well my uncle was a real good talker
He'd talk the beak off a myna bird
Until someone dropped a glass of whiskey in his hand
He never said another word

Because everybody loves a drinking man
Everybody loves a drinking man

So understand that people will judge you
On your good and not your words
So if you're looking for a favor or two
You may likely die of thirst

Because everybody loves a drinking man
Everybody loves a drinking man
Everybody loves a drinking man
Everybody loves a drinking man

In such a deadly disguise
Hot summer nights and other promises

And you do it again,

Didn't believe in miracles, didn't believe you'd come
Didn't see any reason to carry on

But in my african dream, you touched my face
Raised up my children and gave them grace
In my african dream you wiped away my tears
And whispered the promise of a thousand years

Children with eyes like souls ready to fly
Looking at me -- for some kind of sacred sign
Who will teach the young, the names of the ancient ones
Who will tell them from whence they come
I have no answer, don't even have a prayer
All I can do is close my eyes and hope that you will be thre

In my african dream you blessed the rain
Let me stand proud, eased the pain,
You raised me up,
Gave me love, filled my cup.

Life is suffering, suffering is life,
Be happy with the small things that come to you

We could be closer than you have ever dreamt.

To see how the deal gees down -
There's an AK 47 on the dashboard
And mercy's left this town, and you say...

Fill my soul, Africa, don't let me go, Africa

And in the jungle afternoon, he plays polo when he's bored

For with guns you cannot fight a foe that dwells within
But the battle had begun and a soldier he's become

It's a beggarman?s prayer or a string on the wind
Will that be all that lingers on the memory?

And who will remember that African December?
When he knelt before the colors and swore to do or die?
And he kissed his frightened lover, beneath the glowing embers
Of that dark, strange heaven, that ancient sky
Now he's gone to dust, just like all good soldiers must
But the mournful mutter of the battlefield still lingers in the air

So it's farewell sweet Caroline, farewell Elizabeth
Goodbye gentle ladies of the old order
And farewell to your islands carved upon this continent
Some England, some France and some Germany
Soon you will return to that dream across the sea

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Have been thrown out the door

We can shine 'em up and make 'em look as good as new

Better and I would if it wasn't for that train.

 You can tell It's been her first pack
 A leopard coat and piled high hair
 Thick makeup, skin tight slacks
 Tonight she's steppin' out
 She thinks If only he could see her now

 She will leave a trail of turnin' heads
 Smokin' bridges and ice cold beds
 Avoiding the blame at any cost
 She Is spinning wheels and throwing stones
 Burying hearts and digging up them bones
 Making up for time and love that was lost
 She's makin' up for time and love that was lost 
 She's headed down a one way road
 Where hearts don't touch and ends don't meet
 Fired by a danger glow
 It's In her eyes and on the street
 And tomorrow they will talk about
 How tonight she went to town

The street'll never get you no where
You take a street car jumpin' and back beat bump
And get along like it isn't there
You hold your head up high
Like you're gonna fly

You take the bitter 'til you find the sweet
And when you got that crowd and it's screamin' loud
You leave them sittin' on the edge of their seat

You gotta step that step
Walk that walk
Shake that thing
Honey talk that talk

Hollywood, if New York could
Keep you babblin' 'til the break of day
No time to rest and you've got to feel blessed
'Cause you're gonna get it anyway
You start to wail and your face turns pale
You've got to pump it till your pistol pops
And as the eagle flew baby so will you
'Cause you're climbin' all the way to the top

You gotta step that step

Where meek souls will receive Him still the dear Christ enters in

Pulled up in the yard
Found a statue of Jesus

And he seemed all alone
So I loaded him up
And drove him home

Out by my driveway he
Looks down the street
With his long hair and sandals made
Of rebar and concrete
I painted him white with a long purple robe

Till my best pal ran off with my best girl
I felt suicidal with no real friends
So I walked outside with a rope in my hand

Out by that statue there's a big old tree
So I stood on his shoulders
And I counted to three
I had every intention of buying the farm
But when I jumped off he caught me in his arms

Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.

and I did ev'rything I could to get me though the night.

I turned to a stranger just like a friend.

It's getting worse every time I'm around you what can I say
It's night and day

Oh my day judgment was the night met
I say I don't remember but I can't forget
The only time you're on my mind this way
Is night and day

I miss every time your gone for five minutes
Even if I have a dream your in it anyway
Night and day
We got a love that goes a distance
I used to wonder if that made a difference either way
It's night and day

Making money breaking even
Bottom or the top of the world girl your on my mind

Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Staring at the stars
Trying to find the reason why
Her world was torn apart
She's sick and tired of trying to keep
The wolves back from the door

She couldn't stand the pain (*)
She tried to come in from the rain
She was a victim of her heart
Is no-one to blame

What happened to the dreams she had
Visions of her life
Now they're only shadows
Fading in the night
She's given up believing
Turned her back and slammed the door

(Repeat *)

Emma weeps alone tonight
Passion was her crime
No-one hears her cry for help
Her back's against the wall
She's standing on her very edge
She's waiting for the fall

I got my car and drove to town tried to find a show
Cruised around for an hour or two, hunted high and low
I had to find some rock 'n' roll to make my system go

'cause I can't, I can't stop rockin' (*)
Let me hear that music one more time
'cause I can't, I can't stop rockin'

I found a club with a neon sign on the sleazy side of town
A battered jukebox on the wall was the only source of sound
A drunken sailor from a russian whaler was my only drinking mate
Then through the door smashed a hundred more, said yeah let's celebrate

(Repeat *)

The party burst straight out through the doors out onto the street
People came from miles around dancing to the beat
From across the street came a real smart suit, said hey I'm gonna sue
But there ain't no sucker with a long legged hooker, gonna tell me what to do

Dogs of war, no surrender (*)
Dogs of war, I kill the defender
Dogs of war, Scream into battle
Dogs of war, it's the day of the jackal

The town becomes an empty shell, come and spend a day in hell
Forgotten what we're fighting for, no-one wins this bloody war

Stop, get out 
We are the strong arm of the law
Stop, get out

A blast from the siren to make sure
But it came to a stop behind the motorway cop
Who'd been tailing us for more than an hour

He pulled us out of the car on the side of the road
He questioned us one at a time
Where is the gear that we know that you use
We said the only speed we use is on cars

You must journey 'cross the Sea
Find the secret Dynasty
Burning Sand scorching Sun
To the land of the ancient one
The hidden Tomb the last in Line
Lost forever in Sands of Time
Find the Key unlock the Past
You have no choice this is your task

In the Valley of the Kings
There he waits on golden wings
Break the seal and set him free
The Golden one your destiny

Waiting there for you to come
A royal prince the chosen one
Move the stone unleash the past
The one you seek you'll find at last
The boyhood king he walks the past
He hides behind his golden mask
Deep inside his tomb of gold
The greatest story ever told

Dig my friends set him free
Read the words the prophecy
Death will come on swiftest wings
Whoever moves this sleeping king
Carved in stone the book of death
The pharaos curse wil take your breath

Death will come on swiftest wings
For those who move this sleeping king
Heed you now the book of death
Beware the curse with every step
Shine the light the glint of gold
With racing hearts he past unfolds
Open now for all to see
A Pharaos tomb your legacy

A million spirits cry 
A generation loved and lost

It didn't matter what you told to the general, it's how you died

Too much a price to pay

But politicians sang their battle hymn
Soon the bones will start the slaughter
And the end of innocence will begin
There is no one left that made it home
Their lives will see no more
Gone to meet their fallen friends

Shunned before you pierced it and sold it and called it ""punk rock""

Like Judas the traitor we are both favored and deeply flawed

I think I'm fine the way I am
(although we broke our promised land)
I think I'm fine the way I am

I don't want to be confused, I just want to find you
All I want to kill is that which keeps me ill

That they're living in a lame excuse
They're in denial of what you are to me
My heart, my love, my guide
It's not alright with me, the love I lack, I need, I want you back
The circle torn apart, I used to have a heart

I used to know a girl with the deepest trust
That a man could ever know
I broke her neck from the lack of respect

Spread like jelly on bread across the doors of the first-borns
Weaned from birth on meds

diapered, desolate middle-aged doom

filled with fire and finally mine.

Paraded you around like a second place prize,
hair done up, black holes painted on your eyes
Held a book burning in your back yard
while your parents observed from their window, slightly scarred
And I've watched with my shovel in hand
I have in faith in you, child
From his nightmares I've plucked a plan
where that prick, to the world, is revealed as a wicked man

Acquired through shallow misdirection

Mild man-orexia

Tiny diamond in his stroller with his first step chasing the hearse
Sippin' at a cup that's half way filled
But looking forward to the day he pays that drinking bill

There's no peace, there's no quiet on this earth
He confided, nestled tightly in that womb beneath the dirt
Hurt no more and when he turned 24
He wrote a note to nail to God's front door that said

I want death
Death for my birthday
I want death
Death in the worst way
I want death

For my birthday

From the high paying job and the love of his life
He rode a roller coaster ride of lust on their wedding night
They made a baby in unmentionable ways
He was ungrateful as a man could be on that blessed day

And underneath he thought this is all a phase
Just a blip in the existence of a structure vast and great
Pray each night to his cross of a charm
For the one thing he couldn't afford just to buy the farm

Or watch them start a war that's fought for ideals that are dead
I'll never have an argument again

Will be your salt
My blood will hydrate you off
My heart will be your meal
And I won't ride the cycle of the way it kills to think and feel
