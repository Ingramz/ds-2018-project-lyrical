Kiss,"I can't wait a day

Kiss,"I'm feelin' low, no place to go 
And I'm a-thinking that I'm gonna scream 
Because a hotel all alone is not a 
Rock and roll star's dream 

But just when I'm about to shut the light and go to bed 
A lady calls and asks if I'm too tired or if I'm just to dead for
 
Room service, baby I could use a meal 
Room service, you do what you feel 
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain 
I can't say no 

My plane's delayed and I'm afraid 
They're gonna keep me waiting here till nine 
Then a stewardess in a tight blue dress says 
""I got the time"" 

But just as I'm about to take my coat and get my flight
She says ""Oh please"", she's on her knees 
And one more time before I leave I get some 

Room service, baby I could use a meal 
Room service, you do what you feel 
Room service, I take the pleasure with the pain 
I can't say no, no 

In my home town, I'm hangin' 'round 
With all the ladies treatin' me real good 
A sweet sixteen lookin' hot and mean says 
I wish you would 

But just as I'm about to tell her ""Yes, I think I can"" 
I see her dad, he's getting mad 
All the time he knows that I'm in need of

Kiss,"I lived a life of illusion and you had your kicks 
So what, there's nothing left to do
And you and your obsessions and your crucifix
As if what I thought mattered much to you

And you were always my friend
From Childhood's End
It was forever and ever
Did you understand 
It's Childhood's End
But never, the dream is over

Sunday morning in the New York Times
I read you died last night
It said you were smilin' when you blew your mind
And the note you left behind said

You were always my friend 
From Childhood's End
Seems like forever and ever
Yeah, you won't have to have to pretend
It's near the end 
You won't ever be a rock and roller
Yeah, you were always my friend
From Childhood's End
But never, the dream is over
You were just like me
I was just like you
For eternity I'll think of you

Kiss,"Hate, is what I am
'cause underneath this heart 
There beats the heart of man 

You'll wear your crown 
When you're lyin' 6 feet underground

Man was created in the image of god

All you martyrs and saviours 
Go through the same door 
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners
We've all been here before 

Yes, hate is what I am
'cause underneath this heart 
There beats the heart of man 

So you're lookin' for a saviour
But I'm here to tell ya 
You gotta save yourself
Like a lamb to slaughter
All you ever did was follow orders 

All you martyrs and saviours 
Go through the same door
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners,

Kiss,"When I look into the mirror
Just can't believe, what do I see
There's no wakin' from this nightmare
And you're lost in your reality

So you tell me all your secrets
And you tell me that you're innocent
There's something in your eyes I can see
And my face keeps looking back at me

You Confess
You can't help yourself
This living lie that you can't go on
You're possessed
You can't fool yourself
You're the crime and you can't go on

Another day, another sorrow
No today and no tomorrow
Try and wash away the shame
And you smile in your picture frame

You had a charmed life, but you think from grace
And you're long gone without a trace
You're all alone and wonder why
And you laugh when you want to cry

You Confess
You can't help yourself
This living lie that you can't go on
You're possessed
You can't fool yourself
You're the crime and you can't go on

You Confess
You can't help yourself
This living lie that you can't go on
You're possessed
You can't fool yourself
You're the crime and it can't go on
It can't go on

God never spoke to me about your sin
So livin' in our lies will test the faith
So cut your straight lines on the mirror
And dip your hands in holy water
Try and wash away the shame
'cause all you've got is your father's name

Kisschasy,"I've lost my voice
I've said all I have to say
You're thick as porcelain
As clear as cellophane.
I miss the nervous shake
And miss the way it hurt
The way it killed to think that I had You first...
I had you first

So then I force a smile
I take the stage
Now my knees are weak try to concentrate
I'm loosing air with every single breathe that I take..
I look into your eyes
See the chemicals, you're the whitest white
You've become a ghost
You're dead to me so why can't I let you go?

The phone is like a knife
I drive into my ear
I had a love affair
With distance and with fear
The bus is like a hearse
Driving me from her
She's as black as white
She the perfect curse
She's the perfect curse

Chorus

And if the walls had eyes, we would never lie, you could come down on me.

And if you saved my life, how could I survive, you're the one that made me

this way

And when I shake off my daze I see
The one I look up to
But I never told you

I, I do

Sweet as a honeyglaze and
Warm as a summer day

But your will is as strong as concrete

Kisschasy,"The alphabet runs a to z,
Runs through my head to make stories.
Like letters wrote it stings like a cigarette burn.
Some things change and some things don't.
They're watered seeds that help us grow,
Its time for you to forget all that you've learned.

Smiles that take away eye sight,
The words that deafened me tonight.
(remeber when you told me I'd be good for her?)
We fell asleep, fell in love,
And woke up with a brand new scar.
All you have is right now,
Just stay who you are.

I've fallen on my feet,
I'm finally right here where I want to be.
With the world against me,
I'm right here.

When will we forget




",Reminder [Acoustic][*],2005
Kisschasy,"The scratching of paper and pen,
Reminds me of song I wrote two years back.
I remember each and every line,
Like a photo glued to the lids of my eyes.

The shiver of my wheezing chest, Reminds me of the way I felt two years back.
And as we lose all track of time,
I feel her breath like ice on the tip of my spine.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
Oh-oh-oh.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep.

I wait for the bed to get warm,
As my eyes adjust to the darkest light form.
And as I start to drift away,
You're the shake that pulls me back to this state.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
Oh-oh-oh.

The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep,
The shake before I sleep.

And my only regret
Is I gave you all I have,
And you just left

now all that's left
Are the memories and the pain
Because now I sleep on blades
Just to stay awake

I don't care if it takes a million days
Toget this through
Another year is almost over
But I'm the one that's coming to an end

I'll never wake this far from you
And if I never sleep again
It will be too soon!

It can't get away and baby cried her eyes out

The carpet was red, now it's faded pink
There was enough for the walls to drink

Was it only last week
We got stoned off the sky,
Flew under the stars?

Was it only last week

I knelt down and wept.
My hands hit the concrete floor
Until my fingers bled.

I will cut him out of my heart,
I will leave these tears in pools.
Tripped over these pourings, tripped over his feelings,
I've cut him out of my heart.

Burn, burn his clothes,
Burn everything he owned
And the empty chamber left,
I'll carry around as this hollowness
That drags in my voice.

Burn, burn it all,
Burn, burn it all.
Benedictory fire, blessing of the burns.

On Tooting Broadway station
I lay down and slept. 
The concrete for a pillow,
Fingers in bandages.

I cut him out I lie here dry,
I unstiched the bindweed of love.

Burn, burn his clothes...
Burn, burn it all...
My John of Arc...
burn, burn it all...

Give me his charred heart,
Give me his fillings.
And god, give me god to forgive me.

Burn, burn it all...
My John of Arc, fire fire.
My John of Arc,
fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.

Wearing danger smiles. 

She'll meet with the stars,
They'll break down doors.
Those shining pearls float off in space.

She had everything I'd need.

When I go to heaven and stand shivering before this god,

Kept for a poet's pages;
Life and adventure
Don't seem to be paying attention to me!

And let my fancies weave pretty stories.
And tho' I know they are not so,
I like to go wand'ring amid their wistful glories.

And they stay for the breath of a sigh!
I open my arms to enfold them,

That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,2003
Kitty Carlisle Hart,"I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!

Bill, my boy Bill
I will see that he is named after me, I will.
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Aha-ha-ha-ha!
He might be a champ of the heavyweights,
Or a feller that sells you glue,
Or President of the United States,
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President if he didn't wanna be!
Not Bill!

My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And as tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss him or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced,
Pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette...

Hey, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so,
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son
But you gotta be a father to a girl
She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind o' sweet and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!

My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two or three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me!

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
In a fair hand dressed
In the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money,
But, I'll try, I'll try! I'll try!
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!",Strange Music (Nocturne and Wedding Day in Troldhaugen),2003

They're either too young or too old.

Kitty Kallen,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

Kitty Kallen,"Never thought that you would be 
standing here so close to me 
there's so much I feel that I should say 
but words can wait until some other day 

Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear

Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you

Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again

Nein, ich war nicht vernünftig
Hör mir zu, das ist mein Geständnis

Vater vergib mir, ich habe gesündigt

Hör mir zu, das ist mein Geständnis
Meine Beichte, mein Bekenntnis

Ich habe oft gesündigt, ich geb' es offen zu
Ich rede oft mit ihm, doch lese nie in Gottes Buch
Ich sag nicht immer die Wahrheit
Manchmal ist lügen leichter
Dann reitet mich der Teufel und ich bin von ihm begeistert
Das sind die schlimmsten Momente
Ich scheiß auf alles und Ende
Es fühlt sich an wie Blut an den Händen
Gewalt ist keine Lösung
Doch mir bleibt nichts andres übrig
Jeden den ich brauche
Mache ich mir dann gefügig
Ich habe Frauen betrogen
Bin mit Gaunern losgezogen
Erst bin ich hoch geflogen
Dann auf die Fresse in hohen Bogen
Meine Seele ist nicht rein, doch ich tu mein bestes
Wenn's um gute Taten geht, hoff' ich,
Er ist nicht zu vergesslich
Doch ich bin ein Dieb, der Freunde beklaut
Es tut mir Leid, ich habe Freundschaften versaut

Ich bin ein guter Mensch, manchmal vergess' ich das
Vergib mir, ich hab geschworen, dass ich's besser mach
Ich habe Menschen verletzt die ich liebe
Fast die letzten echten Freunde vertrieben
Ich hab mein Leben verwehrt, ich war feige
Doch mein Gewissen zwingt mich heute in die Beichte
Bitte vergib mir, ich kann Nachts nicht schlafen
Mich verfolgen meine Sünden jeden Tag
Ich hab ihn verlassen
Ich wusste dass es falsch war
Bitte vergib mir, verzeih dass ich so kalt war
Ich hab genommen, doch vergessen zu geben
Ich war benommen, ich hab das schlechte gesehen
Ich hab gestohlen, geschlagen und verdrängt
Ich schäm' mich unendlich
Das ist mein Geständnis

Hör mir zu, das ist mein Geständnis

Ich frage mich was falsch und was recht ist
Ich frage mich was gut und was schlecht ist
Ich blick nach oben, ich weiß er wird mich leiten
Er gibt mir Kraft in guten und schlechten Zeiten
Ich hab verstanden
Jetzt bet' ich um Verzeihung
Ich bin jetzt weiter, bitte steh mir bei
Ich seh' meine Schuld ein, ich werde mich bessern
Vergib mir meine Sünden, damit ich sie vergessen kann

Manchmal bin ich zu gut, manchmal zu böse
Ich denke an das Paradies und ob ich wohl dazu gehöre
Ob meine guten Taten reichen um das gut zu machen
Was ich verkackt hab, einfach falsch gemacht hab
Obwohl ich wusste, dass es anders sein sollte
Ich hatte Möglichkeiten, doch hab nicht geholfen
Ich seh' die Schuld ein, ich werde mich bessern
Vergib mir meine Sünden, damit ich sie vergessen kann

Homeboy ich bin ein Gee,steh mit Hoody im Hood
Dieser Track ist hart wie Puller bei deiner Muddi im Mund
Man du Geier stinkst wie Gülle ausm Gulli gepumpt
Du hast 50Cent,ich steh nur noch mit Hunnies im Club
Du bestellst n Glas und ich nehm von der Pulle n Schluck
Man ich fahr durchs Ghetto,sieh wie jeder Bulle hier guckt
Doch egal,ich mach mein Ding und zieh die Wumme du Hund

Ich sag dir clip und klar,man ich punkte den Punkt
Das ist Premium Edition und ich bumse dich Hund
Deine Freundin hat n großes Maul,Pfund in den Mund
Du läufst im Zick Zack für mich jetzt ohne Grund wie beim Bund
Ich bin im Underground ein Badboy,komm runter,mach stunk
Geh dann wieder hoch zum Mädchen und fick die Kuttner am Schlund
Man mein Leben ist wie Viva,ist es bunter als bunt
Doch meine Seele ist so dunkel wie ein Bunker,na und
Man als Rapstar hast du nur noch diesen Kummer und Druck
Denn euer Neid kotzt mich an und ich spucks aus dem Mund
Ich spring so oft in die Menge,dass kein Bunker mich bunkt
Du bist kein Rapper,nein,du bist nur ne Tucke im Puff

Ich sag dir clip und klar, Homeboy ich bin ein Star

Wie jeder Diss hier pumpt, es macht jetzt klip und klapp
Denn meine Clique is back. Homeboy ich bin der Chef

Ich sag dir clip und klar,das hier ist Aggro TV
Ich begrüße dich mit Schlägen,sag jetzt ,,Hallo"" zur Faust
Das hier ist Anti-Alles,ja ich bin ein Macho du Sau
Machst du jetzt Faxen gibt es später Gürtelschnalle ins Maul
Man ich knack den Jackpot locker,wie auf Malle die Frauen
Ich bin im Tackt sogar besoffen,wenn ich lalle,wie Sau
Man ich verarsch meine Fans,ihr könnt mir alle vertrauen
Ich bin nur nett zu dir,wenn du dir meine Platte jetzt kaufst
Ihr wollt Gangsterrapper sein,ihr habt es alle nicht drauf
Ich war noch nie im Knast,doch Gangster hören die Platte im Bau
Du willst jetzt sehen,wer den längsten hat,kriegst Latte in Bauch
Mein Therapeuth sagt,der Rapper hat ne Macke,wow

Ich laufe täglich durch dein Bezirk, doch ich seh' dich nie
Du bist kein G, du bist 'ne bitch, die mein Penis liebt
Ich bin kein G, doch ich bin ein Mann, du nimmst mein Schwanz jetzt in die Hand
Dann in den Mund, dann tief in' Schlund und dann hau ich dich gegen die Wand

Ihr solltet's sein lassen,ich werd' euch einsacken,kleinhacken,einaschen
Das is´ nicht Weihnachten,

Ich schreib fast jede Nacht,sodass ich ja kein Hit verpenn´
Jeder weiß,ich bin die Rettung
Für deutschen Female-rap und jeder will mit mir ein Track,
Meine Flow blowen wie ein Kilo Crak
Hoes sind sauer,ich krieg Respekt,
Krieg nicht mehr als ein Dick fürs Bett
Typisch in Optik sehen sie Katdddmama mein Shit is' fett,
Frisch gepresst,über fresh, ich hab jetzt endlich Cash auf Tasch
Was soll ich tun,Mann? Sie haben recht,wenn euch wegen mir euer Freund verlässt.
Ich mach jetzt mein Ding
Und ihr hängt nur in Clubs ohne Ziel,
Ich hab mein Revier markiert,
Das kommt davon wenn Kat mit dem Hund spielt(Ooh)

Und wir fletschen die Zähne, wir zerfetzen die Szene
Nichts kann uns mehr aufhalten, wir bleiben die Besten für ewig
Du willst Respekt, doch des geht nich', du rappst doch ich versteh nichts
Wenn ich rappe, hängst du mir mit deinem Gesicht am Penis
Los du Stricher, geh bis du auf einem großen See triffst
Bind ein Stein um dein Bein und geh rein, bist du nicht mehr zu sehen bist
Man sucht mein Herz vergebens, aber trotzdem bleib ich fair
Jeder bekommt das was er verdient, doch ich nehm' mir heimlich mehr
Ich gehör' eingesperrt, sie sagen ich sei den Scheiß nich' Wert,
Doch tut mir Leid, die Nummer eins ist zurück, ich bin heimgekehrt
Ich weiß es so zu schätzen, ich hatte mein Leben satt, doch
Jetzt bin ich ein Mensch, dank dem Label mit dem Sägeblatt

Kitty Kat,"Ich liebe meinen Beruf, ich muss nichts anderes tun,
Als mich zu winden und zu schlängeln wie 'ne Schlange, uh.
Tanz an der Stange, du guckst mir gern dabei zu,
Ich liebe diese Blicke und ich kenne kein Tabu.
Ich gehe hoch und runter, von unten wieder hoch,
Zahlen die Typen gut, tanze ich auf ihrem Schoß.
Ich mach mich nackt für sie, ich wackel' mit den Backen,
Siehst du wie es klatscht im Takt zum Beat, siehst du es nicht, ertaste sie.
Gib mir dein Geld, ich zeig dir was dir gefällt,

Sie zieht sich aus, sie stript für mich, sie zeigt den Fickblick,
Ich seh' das Muschipiercing wie es durch den Slip blitzt.
Ich guck', ich gier', ich sabber', ich sag ihr hier ist Papa,
Sie tanzt mit den Arsch auf meinem Schoß, sie massiert den Hammer.
Scheint als würde sie den Ritt genießen, denn ihre Nippel sprießen,
Sie kippt sich Wodka auf den Körper, doch ich bin noch nicht zufrieden.
Komm wir gehen ins Separet, für ein kleines Taitatait,
Du tanzt jetzt nur für mich, zu den anderen kannst du später gehen.
Geld in deinem Slip, Geld in deinem Kopf, deinem Kopf
Nur wegen dem Geld is' das hier dein Job, reib' mein Stock.
Schlüpfer runter, BH auch, Beine auf.
Sie tanzt an der Stange, sie hat´s drauf die geile Sau.
Sie spreizt die Lippen weit und ich guck mitten rein,
Noch ein Schein und dann tanzt sie Breakdance auf den dritten Bein.

Komm Baby strip für mich, zieh dich aus strip für mich,

Für Geld macht sie alles mit ihm wenn er will.
Baby lass die Titten hüpfen, komm schon hol den Arsch raus,
Zeig mir was ich sehen will, mach weiter ich bezahl's auch.

Ich weiß du willst das ich für dich tanz',
Du weißt ohne Geld kommst du hier nicht ran.

Steck mich Schein in Slip und ich mach mich für dich nackt.

Ein bisschen so wie Azad, aber mehr so wie Royd Black
Es liegt an euch jetzt, Schluss mit dem Toy-Rap

Kitty Kelly,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child,

Kitty Margolis,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1989
Kitty Margolis,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Kitty Margolis,"Thousands of years before history recorded
Deep in the jungle, a woman stepped on wet clay
And the print remained there
Future reminder of ages ago

Many lives later a traveler crossed the same path
Under the vines he saw traces of that footprint
Silent testimony
Spiritual journey begun long ago

Eons of changes, illusion of some progress
Fearfulness leading us further from the soul power
Known in early ages
When nature’s heartbeat rang loud on the earth

The key to our freedom lies not just in our thinking
The ancient intuition that’s buried deep within us
Is waiting to be set free
The creator’s gift to her children must flow

We call on the past now to show us where to go
We’re closer to then than we may want to show
We’re closer to then than we may really know
Footprints, ancient footprints

Kitty Margolis,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint

I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Kitty Margolis,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder, 
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,

Bleh

Once upon a time, I spied on you
Bud light lime in my hand and I stand over there
And listen to your little lies about your cool life
You say she will be your wife, but I am
Whites red, irises brown, and your eyes wide
You apologize to me when I see you do a line, but like
I'm open-minded and it's fine
I don't do the shit, but I don't really mind it
I'm not heartless but I'm hardened, a rotten tooth
It's my party, couldn't cry if I wanted to
And the more you taunt me the more I think I'm wanting you
And ever since, you're the prince and I'm the one that's haunting you

Now you're tryna dip, without me
But I'm the princess, read my lip, it's pouty
And the sky is lookin' kinda cloudy so maybe you should stay inside
And you and I can get a little rowdy

Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials
At 3:30 am, I love them
Excuse me, you're a hell of a boy,
Your cigarette breath, well I thoroughly enjoy it
Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials at 3:30 am,
I love them
So call me sober when you're ready,
Not goin' steady, but babe I planned our wedding already

I don't care how long it takes to get you after me
I wrote our names on my binder and everybody laughed at me
But it really doesn't matter, you are radder and cooler a hooligan
And my flattery makes me look like a fool again
You are a tool again, but you're the one that I've chosen
I'm not familiar with this type of devotion
I used to be a pimp without emotion but now you got me simpin'
And singing the Frank Ocean and thinkin' bout you
ooh no no no, I been thinkin' bout you,
ooh no no no I been thinkin' bout you,
Do you think about me?

Lordy, shorty you're a 10 and I wait for your drunk dials
At 3:30 am, I love them
So call me sober when you're ready,

You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed 
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart","Cold, Cold Heart",1961
Kitty Wells,"Heartache number one was when you left me I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score

Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay

I've waited but you must have lost your way

Kitty Wells,"(My heart echoes it back to me)
There's an emptiness tonight
There's a longing in my heart
For your tender loving smile
And sweet caress

Oh, if you could only see
What you're leaving did to me
You would come back
Dear and fill this loneliness

My heart echoes now that you're gone
Dear, my heart echoes with misery
Though you told me that we were through
Dear, my heart echoes it back to me

Though you said that we were through
I'll be waiting here for you
As I have, dear
Ever since we've been apart

I know, dear, that I was wrong
Without you, I can't go on
For you're always
In the echo of my heart

My heart echoes now that you're gone
Dear, my heart echoes with misery
Though you told me that we were through
Dear, my heart echoes it back to me

Kitty Wells,"My mother told me something that everyone should know
It's all about the devil and I learned to hate him so
She said he causes trouble when you let him in the room
He will never ever leave you if your heart is filled with bloom.""

So let the sunshine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never wins
So let the sunshine in, patient with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

When you are unhappy the devil wears a grin
But aw, he starts to running when the rain comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hanging round.

So let the sunshine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never wins
So let the sunshine in, patient with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

If I forget to say my prayers the devil jumps with plea
But all he feels so awful when he sees me on my knees
So if you're full of trouble and you never seem to win
Just open up your heart and let the sunshine in.

So when dad died we wondered why my mother shed no tears
We asked her once about it but she wouldn't tell us why
Instead she'd walk outside each night and smiled held the sky
And just before she left us she called us to her side

Of all the books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible; when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a fingerprint was plain

The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

And not one word of bible verse, not a scripture do you know

Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible, trade the wrong way for the right

If you'd make up your mind
Quit triflin' all the time
If you'd make up your mind, I still love you
If you'd quit foolin' around

I'd love you if you'd just make up your mind

If you'd just settle down
You'd be the sweetest guy in town
I'd love you if you'd just make up your mind
If you'd make up your mind
Quit flirtin' all the time

Now here am I alone and blue
All because I love no one but you

I gave up my friends, I left my home
When you promised to be mine alone
Now you're gone, our love would never be

But really they found no mistakes

I am proud that my name is in the book
For I want to be one never fearing

Through restless sleep I call your name

We’ll laugh and love, sweetheart, again

I lived my childhood again

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Kitty Wells,"Friends, my name is Ferlin Husky.
I'd like to tell you 'bout a man that let alcohol 
destroy everything that God gave him

I saw an accident one day that would chill the heart of any man
It would teach them not to drink a drop 
While the steering wheel's in their hand

This awful accident occurred on the 20th day of May
And caused two little children to be sleepin' beneath the clay
These two little kids walked side by side along the state highway
Their poor old mother, she had died
And their daddy had ran away

As these two little children walked arm in arm
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curb came a speeding car
With a drunk man at the wheel
The drunk man saw the little kids
And he hollered a drunked sound
""Get out of the road you little fools""
And the car, it brought them down

The bumper struck the little girl, takin' her life away
While the little boy, in a puddle of blood
In the ditch, lyin' there did lay
The drunk man staggered from his car 
To see the damage that he had done
And then he let out a yell you could hear for miles
When he recognized his dyin' son

Such mournin' from a drunken man, I've never heard before
While kneeling down by his car he prayed to heavens door
Sayin', ""Oh God, please forgive me for this awful crime I've done""
And his attention then was called away 
By the words of his dyin' son
He said, ""Daddy, why did you do this to us
How come you run us to the ground?
It was you and Mummy we were talkin' about, 
When the car, it brought us down
And I was just tellin' little sister
That I knew we'd see you again someday
But, Daddy, why did it have to be this way
Why did it",Drunken' Driver,2016

Kitty Wells,"I was out on the West Coast, tryin' to make a buck
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town

Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309",Phantom 309,2016
Kitty Wells,"I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on Channel 1-9
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line

And he said, ""Breaker 1-9, is anyone there?
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear""
I keyed the mike and I said, ""You got it, Teddy Bear""
And the little boy's voice came back on the air

""Appreciate the breaker who we got on that end""
I told him my handle and then he began
""Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air""

But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled and I can't walk
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
But I guess it's mine and mom's now 'cause my daddy's dead
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blinding snow

Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet
She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night

You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see
Oh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me
But you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone

Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town

Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' someday
This old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear
But I know now I'll never get a ride on 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends

Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you

Well, I came back and I said before you go 10-10
What's your home twenty, little CB friend
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait

I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street two two nine
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one the heck of a shock
Eighteen-wheeler were lined up for three city blocks

I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again

Well, you better believe I took my turn rifin' Teddy Bear
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy, if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man

We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone
He shook my hand with a mile long grin
And said, ""So long trucker, I'll catch you again""
Ah, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes

I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker 1-9 came the voice on the air
Just one word of thanks from mama, Teddy Bear
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you
Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now before I start to cry
May God ride with you 10-4 and goodbye",Teddy Bear,2016

I could be a ruler of kings

Stop where you are
Light up my lover's way

Would obey, say

Kiuas,"From far beyond the mountains of Crom
Where the forces of winter spare only the strong
Strides forth a son of the north
Destined to conquer, and die by the sword

And like the sun, he rises with golden light
Reaching with his rays into the world
But like the sun, each time he's destined to set
And is forced to hide in the dark...

Where his wounds bleed in silence
Blazing eyes now reduced to dying embers
""Oh, black winged goddess,
You've struck me again with lust, please stop the bleeding -
You've taken enough!""

Across the earth he strides,
And when he strikes he always triumphs
Still he never forgets the shadow of the goddess,
Haunting his steps

And like the moon, his restless eyes shine in the night
Joining the orgy of the stars
But like the moon, his full heart is destined to wane
And is forced to hide in the dark",Black Winged Goddess,2006

Millions who walked with you through the days
Forever will revere your name
Electric fire from your hands
Burned still on the night your last stand
Breathing life into the world

On the last stage lies a hero with a heart of gold
Now a fallen warrior with wounds too deep to endure the cold
Your strings still weep as you're taken away too soon
As you bleed on the strings now the strings bleed with you

So long forgotten in the darkness

Awakened from their age of silence

Bringing death and plague in their stride

Reign of old cultures obsolete
Waiting for centuries to be reborn

A 1000 tears,

An incubated boy was born and the tried to put him down
Didn't have no muscles here
Didn't have no fat
But when he opened up his mouth ya heard the biggest trap
They called him big mouth
Big trap
Loud mouth
Mighty mouth
Here comes the M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Mighty mouth
No silver spoon, grew up too soon out on the dirt
He took a big deep breath and popped the buttons off his shirt
He's no zero oh he's a hero
He's every mother's dream
And all the boys could feel the noise
They'd shake when they'd hear him scream
They called him big mouth

And I don't know how to stop her
Cause she's walkin'

Hiding in the shadows
Don't need to say the wrong thing now
I don't wanna lose her
Should I tell her I'm a doctor
Or a lawyer
Should I tell 100 lies

I need a come on in the dark

I know a girl that you know too 
Everything you heard about her well it's all true 
Under the bleachers out in the snow 
A back street teacher in an all night show 
Bad bad girl 

She ain't too pretty she ain't too proud 
A red hot devil in an angels cloud 
Her finger tips got the magic touch 
She'll shake her hips and make a blind man blush 
Bad bad girl 
No ring around Rosie 

No halo over her hair 
No ring around Rosie 
Weak in the knees go around and round 
They all fall down 
Ring around Rosie 
Ring around Rosie 

When her daddy's at work 
And her mom ain't home 
She ain't no angel you can hear her moan 
She's so good when she's so bad 
Best little girl I have ever had 
Bad bad girl 

No ring around Rosie (Bad bad girl)

Out past where the black top ends.
We'd walk to Church on Sunday mornings,
Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence.

On that roadside pickin' blackberries.
That summer I turned a corner in my soul,
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer.
It's where I found Jesus.
Where I wrecked my first car,
I tore it all to pieces.

In my shackled up G-T-O.

Throw rocks at her bedroom window.
We'd turn out the headlights,
Drive by the moonlight.
Talk about what the future might hold,
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer.
It's where I found Jesus.
Where I wrecked my first car,
I tore it all to pieces.

Ain't just for high achievers.
I've learned; I come to know,

I went out into the world,
An' I came back in.
I lost Mary, 
Oh, I got her back again.
An' drivin' home tonight,
Feels like I've found a long-lost friend.

Stay devoted still checking all ya motives
Thoughts unloaded though so many times I'm misquoted
So now it's noted these origins of residence
So my adversaries can now make they exodus

There ain't no guessing this when I proceed to finish this

Standing with my locust fist now I got ya choking this
But your broker diss got lost with ya hopelessness
But from genesis I'll still stand opposing this
Smack it up, if they last name is skills ya first name should be lack of
It's time to act up or call in your back up
These fools make me crack up

You talk your junk but then you come around to give me mad love

Lyrics - Integrity (With Grits)

Talking:
Yo, yo what's up yo?
Yo, what's up man?
Yo, y'all are GRITS right?-yeah man
Yo, I-I want to get into this gospel rap thing man.
Aw, sh man it's a task
Yo I was just wonderin' if I could give you this rhyme I wrote
Go ahead man, I ain't hatin'. Go ahead yo


It's all about me, me, and did I mention me
I'm the dopest rapper in the gospel rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper
Yo, all y'all cats need to retire
With your played out raps, I'm the roughest and toughest
I love the spotlight yo you better make sure this mike sounds right
Or I'll charge you double on this honorarium
Don't ask me to speak words of encouragement cause yo I got the dopest skills
Don't ask me to do what God wills,
It's all about keepin' it real and makin' sure I get me a fat type of record deal
Give the crowd something they can feel
Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile
Yo, I been doin' this a long while, man, like two months even
So what if I look like a heathen, I can still kill the ruckus demon
I got all the girls fiendin' , I put emcee back into emceeing
Yo God and hip-hop versus the god of hip-hop I believe in
I'm acheivin' what I want. These skills is what I flaunt
Yo you caint get me so tell me what you got.
Man, I live and die for the god of hip-hop, I mean God and hip-hop
So y'all fools need to stop

CHORUS
This is a message to you rap infants,
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills but skill alone don't get you props
It takes integrity, when rappin' for Christ on microphones

Who's this Babylon emcee with the audacity, approaching me
As if I got a stamp of approval for his fallacy
I hear you talkin' 'bout yourself
And claim you keep it real but I ain't feelin' it
I'm feelin' to your flesh but only kill the little light so dimly shinin'
I question why you rhymin',
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use Him as a jewel well then your crown
And you clout your time will tell
In life He must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
You see the ministry begins theminute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life you hear in the pages of His very Word

You ain't understandin' He demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to hip-hop caint be found in His Commandments

",Integrity,2000
KJ-52,"Yo, yo what's up yo? Yo, what's up man?
Yo, y'all are Grits, right? Yeah man, true
Yo, I want to get into this Gospel Rap thing, man
Aw, sh man, it's a task
Yo, I was just wonderin' if I could give you this rhyme I wrote
Go ahead man, I ain't hatin', go ahead, yo

It's all about me, me, and did I mention me?
I'm the dopest rapper in the Gospel Rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper
Yo, all y'all cats need to retire

With your played out raps, I'm the roughest and toughest
I love the spotlight, yo, you better make sure this mike sounds right
Or I'll charge you double on this honorarium
Don't ask me to speak words of encouragement
'Cause, yo, I got the dopest skills

Don't ask me to do what God wills
It's all about keepin' it real and makin' sure
I get me a fat type of record deal
Give the crowd something they can feel

Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile
Yo, I been doin' this a long while, man, like two months even
So what if I look like a heathen, I can still kill the Ruckus Demon
I got all the girls fiendin' , I put emcee back into emceeing
Yo, God and Hip Hop versus the God of Hip hop I believe in

I'm acheivin' what I want, these skills is what I flaunt
Yo, you can't get me, so tell me what you got
Man, I live and die for the God of Hip Hop
I mean God and Hip Hop, so y'all fools need to stop

This is a message to you rap infants
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills
But skill alone don't get you props, it takes integrity
When rappin' for Christ on microphones

A message to you rap infants
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills
But skill alone don't get you props, it takes integrity
When rappin' for Christ on microphones

Who's this Babylon emcee with the audacity, approaching me?
As if I got a stamp of approval for his fallacy
I hear you talkin' 'bout yourself
And claim, you keep it real but I ain't feelin' it
I'm feelin' to your flesh but only kill the little light so dimly shinin'

I question why you rhymin'?
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use him as a jewel well then your crown?
And you clout your time will tell

In life he must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
See, the ministry begins the minute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life
You hear in the pages of his very word?

'Cause if not face his rage
You ain't understandin' he demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to Hip Hop can't be found in his commandments
Take notice because the atmosphere is about to get tense

Wanna find relatin' truth to, some gone take it offense
Young cats, heed the message of this elder emcee
Who got responsibility to let you know what kind of abilities to key?
But it seems that some of y'all ain't caught the vision as we

This is a message to you rap infants
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills
But skill alone don't get you props, it takes integrity

",It's the S.O.I. (Sons of Intellect Anthem),2000
KJ-52,"Here's a few things that I like now
Making beats on my mpc
Picking up an underground CD or mix tape
Diggin through record crates
Goldin stay looking for the perfect break to sample and truncate
Raw raps on a raw track
Copping mad timberlands like the mall that you shop at
Combat fatigues a notebook full of rhyme schemes that I keep in my backpack
Anthem of a life rockin the mic
Spending a little time showing love to my wife
The way Christ loved us sacrificed his life
Bore them stripes restoring the life
Doing shows on the stage seeing souls getting saved
Hearing this track being played in your escalade
As you roll through the hood sitting on blades
Cats gonna bug when they hear they mom say

:chorus:
I like the hands up keep ya hands up
Party people in the front I need ya hands up
And when ya hands up leave your hands up
See there's a lot of thing I like but only one thing I love
I like the hands up keep ya hands up
Party people in the front I need ya hands up
And when ya hands up leave your hands up
See there's a lot of thing I like but only one thing I love

I like Saturdays and just waking up late
I like things right away 'cause I don't like to wait
I like tasty cakes, and Philly cheese steaks
And the Tampa bay Bucs and Miami hurricanes (whuuuut...)
Now I like my shoes clean with a fresh pair of jeans
And some rice and some beans and a box of krispy kremes
I like Mt. Dew 'cause I like the caffeine
And the pistons and wolverines is my sports teams
I like the Double-Double at the In and Out Burger
But I don't like McDonalds they always mess up my order
I like my man Spongebob and Homestar Runner
I like flip flops and tank tops in the summer
I like to make goofy faces when I smile for the camera
I like to rock old school hip hop and mc hammer
I like Xbox clean socks I like Canada
But there's one thing I want and this is what I'm asking ya

Repeat Chorus

I love the way that God just takes a man
And then changes him gives him strength to stand
I love when the world says I ain't got a chance
See I'm loving that you're the one that tells me I can
I love the fact that you just loved me first
You erased my past and freed me from the curse
And even at the times when I just act my worse
I love that ya take me back that I don't deserve
I love every time I open your word
That I see in every line every chapter and verse
That your love made you die and that love that occurred
It left you crucified 'cause your love for the world
And I love how you just love me so much
I love how you provide just more than enough
And with the rhyme that I say now that I bust
See I like a lot of things but you're the one I love

Repeat Chorus



",This Is Love,2000
KJ-52,"Intro:
SOI
Beat mot
Game on it
Where ya at
Old school
I'ma take you way back
Waaaay back
Yo Yo
As it goes a little something like this


Verse One:
Yo it's the K to the J, J to the five
Five to the two, it's time to get live
Party people in the house if you're feeling all right
Throw your hands in the air wave them side to side
You can dip dip dive you can socialize
You can lime to the lemon, you can lemon to the lime
But nine years ago a friend of mine
Hit me up just to ask the time
I'm looking at my watch it said quarter to twelve
He shook his head, he had something to tell
He said ""Check it my brother now it's plain to see
I'm going to make it plain just as plain can be""
'cause you her and you there
But a life without Christ ain't going nowhere
And I was just like you I was jamming on it
Then he sang a little song a little something like this hit it...

Chorus:
We rock the mic in a different way
Just two turntables and a fresh DJ
Party people in the house are you feeling OK
Then let the record play all night all day (repeat)

Verse Two:
Stop a second I need to hear more
He said ""I came through the door and I said it before""
But you didn't listen to me this first time
So open your mind and let me open your eyes
'cause the blind lead the blind can't you see that my brother
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
You going under and you blind to the facts
It ain't where you from and it ain't where you at
It ain't the radio, Cazals or Kangol hat
Now you be illing and it's like that
Your life's wack just broken pieces
You got Adidas but you ain't got Jesus
And a hotel, a motel or a holiday inn
Now it don't mean nothing 'cause your life keeps fronting
And you still lost in sin
I said a hotel, a motel, or a holiday inn
Now it don't mean nothing 'cause your life keeps fronting
And you still lost in sin help me say it like...

Chorus: 4x

Verse Three:
I ain't no joke 'cause your life's broke
But now I'm glad that we spoke,
'cause pretty soon you choke
And everything you see is goin' up in smoke
So what's your hope you gonna sink or float
One day you croke and one thing I'll tell
You goanna rock the bells all the way to hell
And all the ball is shot
God is making paper
All the players you goanna catch babies
La-de da-de, who likes to party
You think you the man but you really ain't nobody (what?)
It was the lamb who was led to the slaughter
Rolls beneath me the planet rock like bam-botta
The one who owns the play just like the car-da
The one who is the spirit, son and the father
The one who's eyes last sea and the water
God's son we welcome back like carter

Chorus: 4x

Outtro:
All night all day, all night all day,
Yeah, fresh, for 2000
You sucker (Hah)

'cause I'm alone, I need a friend
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
I'll tell you what, do this
Make sure the hook is on there
And just record whatever I do, alright?
Alright KJ, yo, it's the KJ 5 to frickity 2
S O I, you know what I'm saying? Silas repeat this

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Sick of sticking out my neck to get me burned like a Bic lighter
Sick of all the Jim Carey type 'Liar Liar'
So I'm sticking to get a grip like some hand pliers

My manifesto, hit you the best flow
Hide behind the mics like you was stinkin' death row
I'm already seeing through you like some windows
Stay on you like halo, shine like day glow

Trying to be the professional using amateur
You couldn't get the picture even with a camera
My stamina, this program is strictly slamming ya
You ducking like some draft dodgers heading to Canada

I gotta hand it to you, you know how to break me down
Judas' kisses never seem to ever make a sound
But thanking God that was not from the lost and found
But keep in mind that what goes around comes around

I need someone who understands the way I feel

Yo, remember me? Yo, we go way back
W-w-what do you mean you don't remember me? What?

Hello, how you doing? What? You don't remember me?
Love turns to hate, friends turn to enemies
Homies turn to phonies, haters turn to cronies
As the world turns, I'm still standing lonely

There's only one love that never turning cold
Always got my back when I got played like a Casanova
Always had a dry shoulder just to cry on
And always made a way through the dark with a light on

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
'cause I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel

Hey yo, Dark, now tell me what's up?
Why you always seem to got beef like ground chuck?
We used to cool, but I guess, I'm out of luck
Would you mind taking the knife out of my back it go stuck?

It's the Christ Jesus putting back all the pieces
His love runs the deepest, now close to ever peaces
Tosses sin as far as Wests to the Easts
Never truly alone, with the love that he releases

I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel
So I can feel the way you feel
'cause I'm alone, I need a friends
I need someone who understands the way I feel

And put a sermon like eric in ya ear like a qtip
Now it's common sense that Ja Rules
But I'm a tell you about Jesus who's the leader of the new school
You thinking you's cool you emcees is lost boys
Got no cash money you juvenile like some hot boys
I drop noise when I let the sound blast
And tell Big Boy Andre about Jesus Christ the outcast
Here's the deal I feel it's now time to be Real
Christ died on Calvary not on Cypress Hill
It don't matter even if your slim or if your shady
JayHova reigns supreme but his name ain't' Jay z
And it's mos def that the Mobb was deep
That hung the Son of Man who died just to bring back the lost sheep
On all streets all peeps naughty by nature
Whether you biggie or small you can know the living Savior now..
(OLD SCHOOL)
Let me take you back to the old school
And tell you about the Fresh Prince of Peace now who just cold rules
We keep it nice and smooth Rakim like Eric be
And run â??Dâ?? emcees to show our biz like AG
See I'm down with two live crews full of fat boys
And even though we young emcees now we can't avoid
The one who everlasts reigns as the lamb slain
Just for you and I Jesus went to the House of Pain
You can be the Black Sheep but Christ reigns supreme
Drink ya Ice T with some vanilla Ice Cream
Don't matter to me be the Public Enemy
He'll still make your sin disappear like he's Whodini
In this biz I put his name on the Markie
That's why I'm calling out these names when I emcee

Check it now you can bounce with me
No limit to my God like Master P
What audacity it's quite ludacris actually
To think you could trick your daddy
God the father sees everything naturally
You can't fool him I'm like woah nelly
He'll put bone thugs back in harmony
It ain't hard to see just what he's done for me
I knew a guy named Bubba who'd spark the place
He was little like Wayne and had a scarface
But now this cat done changed his ways
Talking how he's saved from amazing grace
Understand that Christ had to â??Câ?? murder
So you and I when we die live forever

",47 Emcees (Interlude),2002
KJ-52,"Who am I? The one that gets laced tight
The one you wear, hit a flare on the same night
That you hit an uprock, I'm the one in the closet next to one sock
The one you rock on the cardboard box
Walking to the one block
You know the one spot peeps get the one shot
Got one thought on the task at hand
You can ask your man I'm part of master plan
Only be	-boys and be	-girls, they understand
Whatever you say now, ya wish is my command
Name it, I'll be the footwork to your head spin
Follow your lead, go anyplace that ya legs bend
At ya cipher session I'm ya best friend
I got a twin, we's a pair clocking size 10
Head's a shell, three stripes on side
Laces large, on your feets I reside
Keep me clean, keep me laced, and I'll be alright
I be the first element up in here tonight

Who am I?  See, I'm the one that you be gripping tight
The one that makes you sound real good when you be flipping right
And I'm the one causing fights up at the open mic
I'll make ya sound real stupid if you don't hold me right
I got emcees fiending for me all day and night
I could care less if ya on me if ya black or white
See all that matters when you rock me don't be coming wack and
Don't hold me to the speaker or I'ma feedback and
I'm used for rapping, every now and the used for passing
Back and forth in ya crew in a freestyle fashion
I get rocked, ripped, flipped on and blasted, 
I'm spoke on, choke on, hit on, spit on, and mastered
I've outlasted, been used to tell truth and lies
Used to kill the youth and used to open up they eyes
I come in all kinds of sizes, heard all kinds of voices
Sometimes I'm plugged in, you know sometimes I'm cordless
Keep me clear, keep me close, and I'll be alright
See I'm the second element up in here tonight

Who am I?  I got two heads and they always spinning
I got two arms that the deejays, they use for ripping
Plus a fader in my middle that they always gripping
I'm completed with the two records used for mixing
They pulling tricks and cutting up, ya know they scratching
Remixing beat, juggling just whie they mix and match and
All kinds of beats till it's the heat that I know ya catching
And I'm the one that started hip-hop in case ya asking
I got knobs and faders in a mad abundance
I come in many names, but most time it's 1200
When I get played now, you know that you truly love it
Now clean the needle on my arm or I'll be sounding busted
I'm disregarded, treated like I ain't legitimate
I'm making music, you don't see me as an instrument
And it takes true skills to get on me and be ripping it
Nobody sees my contribution, they ain't getting it
You know there's one thing that really now makes me mad
You used to blow me off but now I'm the latest fad
I'm the thing that every rock band they got's to have
Now people say my name and they be like ""Now what is that?""
Keep me running, keep me spinning, and I'll be allright
I'll be the third element up in here tonight

Who am I?  Se I'm hiding in your backpack
You tear my tip off, replace it with a fat cap
I'm 12 oz. of steel concealed in a knapsack
Ya pull me out, ya shake me up, and then attack that
Wall or train while ya steady throwing up your name
Leaving these end to end burners, ya getting ghetto fame
Now me and my brothers, ya know we come in many colors
Steady beautifying the walls of a ghetto culture
Toys and suckers now you know they getting dissed quick
I'm going all city all up in ya district
Ya hold me with control so I never drip thick
I'm tagging up ya spot, nobody misses it
See I'm the brush to a modern day type DiVinci
I'm the new urban renewal for ya block's committee
I've spoken words of the youth of an inner city
I'm vandalism but to others I'll be called graffiti
Keep me shaking, keep me spraying, and I'll be allright
I be the fourth element up in here tonight

Who am I?  See I'm the God that you don't know about
I gave you breath up in your lungs that you can't go without
See you know the facts of My story you been told about
I'm always reaching out for you but you just keep on holding out
I know your doubts, I know you're thinking that I ain't real
See I know you forgot about Me when you got ya last record deal
See I know the way you feel, I walked the earth just like you
And like a child up in his Father's arms, I long to hide you
Many times I invite you while standing here right besides you
But you walk right past, you ignore My hands here given to guide you
I gave you gifts, I gave you talents that you just used to gain your wealth
But you took my gifts and talents only for you, just to glorify yourself
I was beaten and bruised, crushed now for your iniquity
Stripped naked, I was spit upon just for you to live eternally
Yet you blaspheme Me, you make moves without asking Me
Then you blame Me for your troubles and calamities, you kidding me?
Keep Me first, keep Me in your life, and it's gonna be alright

What I mean?

It's that to you that I'm always catching these comparisons
And after shows I got these people coming up to me saying
You sound like Slim Shady son you sound like Eminem
And I be like now really man do I gots to go through this again
See I used to get mad and sick of people saying that
Till at this one show this one day I met this one cat
He told me how he used to listen to you but now listens to me
Had your LP but threw it out and bought my CD
I'm like ""For real?"" he's like ""Yeah,"" said my music made a difference
It got him away from all your words and images
Gotta mention this now what about the effects you have on kids?
You ever stop to think about the millions you influence
Or is it just irrelevant is it a true life you telling it
Or just a way for some record companies selling it
The only thing we's got in common is our melanin
Or a lack of it but anyway now this is what I'm saying
Its for you that I'm on my knees now daily praying
Praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying
Now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing
Praying one day that you'll be calling upon his name and
But anyway I'm signing off now don't keep me waiting
This is KJ another cat just trying to make it

[Chorus]

[Verse III]
Dear Slim I heard about the stuff you's going through
See I could relate to you cause son I'm about as old as you
See we both know what it's like just to be growing up to be in a neighborhood
When you's the one and only kid that's white
Or to get booed when you on the mic just because your skin is light
It ain't right but sometimes you know that's life
But really tell me what you do?
You just push on with hopes on that someday you'll put on your crew
I hope you understand that I ain't even dissing you
And even though it's a song you'll probably never listen to
See what I send to you is this
Is that a life without Christ is just a life that is never fixed
I hope you remember this now a few sentences
About a living God who loves you and plus forgives
And I'll be praying for your ex-wife and plus your kid
It's hard to live in a world as crazy as this one is
And even though now it really might sound redundant
God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance
You'll sell a couple mill I'll probably sell a couple hundred
There's more to life than selling records and just getting blunted
But anyway that's really all I gots to say
Just another word from an emcee now around the way
Maybe some day we meet each other in some way
Till then one love one God one way

[Chorus]",Dear Slim,2002

If you here to just ride, go ahead and do that

Eh you I came in the spot saw the crowd rock
Heard the sound pop and then I just thought
Now this must be the place cause this crowd be hot
And this must be the case of what the crowd's got
That the love of God's grace is what we just drop
I gotta whole lot to say and you know we don't stop
I dash past ya to blast faster
While I keep ya legs moving like a stair master
I'm feeling great gotta reason to just celebrate
Christ rose on the third now set the record straight
Reigning supreme as the champion heavyweight
Ruler of the universe the name above every name
And if you here to get live no need to ashamed
You got a reason to get down if ya life's changed
Quite strange for me to see you standing here
So come along in here stick ya hand right here

she got a whole lot of kids you can't miss em when you's coming through 
cause she be shacked up with little boy blue 
but half them kid's ain't seen their pops since like 1982 
but down the street next to the swap meet 
that's the spot where the 3 little pigs yo they be catching beef 
they took tweedledee and knocked out his front teeth 
and left tweedledum just straight bleeding on the back seat 
I live on the corner man next to Jack and Jill 
you know them two brother and sisters who be acting ill 
I tell em to step back and chill but they'll smack ya grill 
now let me tell you straight up now you can catch the deal 
you know Humpty dumpty man they straight played him 
knocked him off the wall scrambled him up now and ate him 
see I ain't playing where I live I got to stay praying 
and every time I come around y'all can hear me saying

Mary had a little lamb case you didn't know 
that little lamb took my sin made it white as snow 
and every where that the lamb will go 
that's the place I got to go man I got to see the streets of gold 

Sitting on the corner with my tape recorder and Jack Horner 
kicking freestyle raps for scraps of spare change 
to change my money range and cry like Danny Ainge 
till I make enough checks to win back my ex girl friend 
I can't pretend I didn't wish that I'd never seen her ill demeanor 
and this fly dish and the spoon ran away broke out to Santa Fe 
left me cold ain't seen her since Saturday 
but hey I got to say I been dissed since way back 
bought a girl a knick knack but patty was wack 
in fact I'll get em all back using my rap sheet 
and make em outcast singing bah with the black sheep 
and take them to phat beats and show them my work 
and have them say I'm the man and play them out like a jerk 
and flirt with a wink and eyebrow on tilt 
and leave them there while I go to the house that Jack built singing.. 

Chorus:

don't get me started on Jack be Nimble 
I mean that cat's the kind of dude who just always seems to stay in trouble 
he always got to hustle kicking it with the 3 blind mice 
on the corner selling magic beans rolling dice 
now I be giving him advice but he can't understand 
Patty Cake? she used to chill w/ the bakers man 
she got God in her life now and if you see her right now 
it's a whole another sight now 
see I be quite proud just to see how Christ showed and blowed up 
and just turned her whole life around 
sometime I'm wishing I was living in a nicer town 
you know a place where London bridge ain't always falling down 
ya boy Old McDonald he's a little older now 
he had a farm but well it's kind of gone for now

I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing... 

Back in the day I used to rock the MC Hammer pants 
jump in the middle of the party bust the running man 
doing the Roger Rabbit at the middle school dance 
got my man next to the bleachers now that's where we stand 
walk up to the girl like “now will you dance with me?” 
she's like “well listen you'll never ever have a chance with me 
I got a boyfriend and he's at like six foot three 
250 pounds and he could beat you up in his sleep 
and I'm like “well really what's that got to do with me?” 
I don't see him around here so why don't you just come with me 
I'll get you some fruit punch maybe some cookies 
I got the new Vanilla Ice tape how can you not love me? 
she's like “well first off all your pants is straight ugly 
you can't dance and your personality just bug's me

I grew up in Inglewood a little brown boy 
had straight hair and I rocked corduroy 
walked down Venice way in my own way 
wasn't very popular with the girls in 5th grade 
they used to call me nerd 
that was even if they used to call me at all 
across the school hall I put my head and thought 
what could I do to pursue and fought 
in my own mind was a struggle of sorts 
school was a game and I was off court 
on the bench and the coach wouldn't let me off once 
I sat in the corner of the yard like a dunce 
and all I ever wanted was the girl to have lunch 
maybe in the cafeteria with some punch 
but it didn't happen I didn't have heart 
cause I knew how it would end from the start and then I asked... 

Would you please,
would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me, 
I see you over there with the jocks, 
I see you over there with the rich boys, 
I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing...  

when I was growing up it was hard to be happy 
kids knock the books out my hand and make fun of my acne (exactly) 
give me a wedgie while they throw spitballs at me 
and stuff me in my own locker and laugh at me 
(ahhhh ha..) oh you think that's real funny 
cause I'm 5 foot with huge feet and I dress crummy 
and all the school bullies want to just take my lunch money 
c'mon man I only got a dollar twenty 
ya know ya life is just really sad man 
when you play dodge ball your picked as the last man 
and ya run as fast as ya can just like a mad man 
cause the football team wants to throw you in the trash can 
so really will this madness ever end 
really will the nerd ever get revenge? 
will this girl call me back at around ten? 
will you go out w/ me? I just want to be friends 

Would you please,
would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me, 
I see you over there with the jocks, 
I see you over there with the rich boys, 
I see you over there with all the pretty girls, 
and I'm asking one thing...  

Now days I'm a little older plus a little bolder 
but it seems like I just can't get over 
you ever have a day where nothing goes right 
well that just seems to be the story of my whole entire life 
so anybody out there know what I mean? 
to feel like your third string on a football team? 
and ya never ever gonna reach any of your dreams? 
and your only hope is making onion rings at burger king 
but now a days a lot of things done changed 
since Christ came into my life now and just rearranged 
the way I look at myself son it ain't the same 
I drive in a whole ‘nother lane going against the grain 
I know it might just seem a little strange 
the fact remains I changed when I called on his name 
so call me a nerd call me lame it don't matter to me 
see all I need to know is that my wife will dance with me 

Would you please,
would you dance with me, 
my darling would you please take a chance with me,

sick of the way we live our lives and run and hide

Verse 1:
Hey yo I'm gazing at the skyline watching sun shine 
let my mind unwind and rewinding to the time when my eyes was blind 
see the pride I hid behind it just killed my mind 
but left me thinking I was fine but really I couldn't see the signs 
when all that time your son is shining on me 
it's right above me it's bright and lovely but I just won't see 
I'm running from the son's beams scared of what I don't see 
just while the son be blazing on me because he knows me 
and I can feel the sun shining on my skin 
I run and hide inside close the blinds to keep the son from shining in 
so much time I spend running from the son light's that's peeking in 
I'm weakening and I probably will never see again 
but just then it's a ray of light just blazing bright 
the first time in my life just when my dark night just came to life 
see I'm just the type with all my might to pick a fight 
but for some reason I'm standing here soaking up this light

Verse 2:
The thing about the light of the son is right when he comes 
even if you right in the slums you'll still see the light that he's brung 
ain't a thing existing on this earth without the son's light 
most might ignore the son whenever they live they life 
others want the son to shine but they don't want it bright 
they choose a darker light so they can live they life with darker nights 
but that's a harder life I'd rather just embrace the light 
and blaze the mic cause even the deadest person I seen come to life 
you see the son be shining on my skin and warms me from deep within 
I can't keep it in I got this peace within 
the son of man I made my peace with Him 
that's why you see me grin and every single day you gone see me seeking him 
I got's to speak again about the son who's freeing men 
I'm taking in the son just like the oxygen I'm breathing in 
and my deepest scars the son light be healing them 
I think it's just going to be a sonny day now once again

I used to make excuses like you weren't the one that hit her
It was just the liquor in ya
My dad the perfect example of hatred and why am I so bitter?
Ya told me real men don't cry that was a lie
You don't realize what goes on inside of my mind
As time passed my heart ran cold my emotions froze
Lost track of the bruises and the broken bones
Just once wanted to hear that you loved me
Wrap your arms around me and hug me yeah right
Remember the first time I couldnt feel the pain
It was when grandma came and took me to church
Where God relieved the hurt and he knows it took work
But I forgave you he could save you but the question is
Will you let him in it would be such a blessing
To see you as a changed man and holdin my mother's hand

Why is it more that things change the more they stay the same?
Why do old people drive slow in the fast lane?
Why is it when I grab the mic you stare at me strange?

Why's every time I eat I get my shirt stained? (dang!)
Wassup Tremaine, what, your name's Wayne?
Dang man, why can't I just remember people's names?
All the same there's a question in my mind
Why do I have to wait in line just to wait in another line
And when I think I'm done I gots to do it one more time?
Why oh why am I always stuck behind
The lady who has writes a check in the express check out line?
Excuse me miss, it's 10 items not 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Why do we run in circles chasing after nothing new?
Somebody won't you please tell me why because I haven't got a clue?

Why do the voices in my head get louder when I try to sleep?
Why can't I seem to count all the leaping sheep?
I'm knee deep in distribution, retail, paperwork, and e-mail.
Why can't I afford a secretary to handle office detail?
Why are prices high, water wet, people cruel?
Why does every single record exec try to play me for the fool?
Why don't bar stools have backs? Do they want the drunks to fall off?
And why do we have to fill up all the precious silence with small talk?
Why do we all walk with our heads down and walkmans up to ten?
Are we afraid to let a stranger in every now and then?
Why do sucker emcees spit loud and claim to be the hardest
And then sit down to write their rhymes with a dictionary plus a thesaurus?
Why does the commerce strangle art instead of the other way around?
I guess it's hard to work the angles when the cipher's always round.
Why do we drown our sorrow, reach both hands out for tomorrow
When just living today is hard enough to swallow? Why?

CHORUS

(Soulheir the manCHILD)
Why do conceptual song structures cramp my style and hand alike?
Why do organized emcee battles make wack rappers grab the mic?
Why am I here, cause the instruction manual wasn't clear?
Why does my transmission make that sound when I try to shift it's gears?
Why is my stereo so loud? Do I want all neighbors to hear?
Am I my own street team member try to catapult my career?
Why does a dog bark, bee sting, bird sing?
But first things first, why do you burn my album with left hands on your purse string?

(KJ)
Why do we disrespect each other instead of loving one another?
Why do we have to focus on the skin tone and color?
Why can't we see that we sisters and we brothers
And understand we all equal to God and plus He loves us?
Bust this. Ima say this just again and again.
Why oh why can't we all be friends?
But there's one things I just can't comprehend.
Why do they put Braille at a drive-up ATM?
I guess that's for all the car driving blind men.
Why do we just hate God but really love to sin?
Really, man, shouldn't that be just the other way around?
Why do I always have to laugh when somebody falls down?
Why do things get worse when they're already going wrong?
Why's customer service put me on hold for so long?
Why do you tell me to hold on when I'm already holding on?
Why can't we all just get along?

CHORUS

Why does fast food take so long to get it?
Why do people fart in public and say someone else did it?
Why do you ask my opinion but get mad when I give it?
And why ask for wisdom if you ignore the Holy Spirit?
Now check the lyrics cause this might apply to you.
Dude, why's brushing your teeth just like so hard for you?
Now if your breath stank, don't be be saying ""Hi, how are you?""
If I give you a breath mint, don't be like, ""No, thank you.""
Get a clue, now tell me why your clothes is fake, too.

Why do you say it's FUBU when ya know it's PUBU?
And why do you say yes when you really mean no?
Why do you tell me to stop when you really mean go?
Why's the bad choice the one choice I always chose?
But in spite of how I acted, why did God love me so
Much the He would just pay the price of my soul?
But I don't need to ask why. I already know.

Brightly chrome vendaidoes

From the Bruce Lee Roy glow
On a mother a pearl face

Nice lips, nice thighs, nice hips
Pussy tighter then a pair of vice grips

Back in the day when I was a teenager
Before I had status and a two way pager
You could find KJ listenin to hip hop
Blastin it so loud my parents were like ""turn it off""
I used to rock turtlenecks wit Mc Hammer pants
Watch Yo Mtv raps jus to check out the lastest dance
I did the runnin man, they said not bad for a white man
I siad I'm not really white, I jus really need a tan
I used to write the girlies numbers down upon my hand
And I didn't go nowhere wit out my tapes and walkman
Rollin up the bottom of my pants as tight as I can
And I'm up late at night talkin to my girlfriend and

[Chorus]
Back in the day I was so cool [I was so cool]
Back in the day I was so cool [The coolest one in school]
Back in the day I was so cool [Well I can't lie to you]
Back in the day I was so cool [I was a nerdy little dude]

[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I wanted lines in my eyebrows so I took a razor
But I messed up and accidentally I just shaved the
Whole eyebrow off I was like, ""I'm goin crazy""
See it was jus tough jus growin up in the 80's
But for me it was rough cause no girls would ever date me
All the ladies I asked out was like... ""well, maybe""
You're okay, but you're no Patrick Swayze
Unfortunately I think that all my teachers hated me
Cause I sit in the back makin noises like I'm crazy
Ahhh... but its all gravvy
In third period today I asked out this lady
Got the paper out got the pencil now whoops here I go
Will you go out wit me, check yes or no
I'm feelin all slick when I handed her the note
I told you 10 times already no, now leave me alone

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I was only fifteen when I jus met my Savior
And he came in straight in my heart and jus changed the
Way the used to live in all my ill behavior
See its amazin to see my life that I jus gave ya
So amazin to me Jeus Christ you became the
Savior to me and I ain't never been the same the
Way I would be back in the day it would amaze ya
But the change  that I see it was done in a major
Way that would be so that all I can do is thank ya
And everydat jus for me is a new day to praise ya
Cause you came jus to be all I need and you jus made a way for
Me too see so I broke it down for you
Now Ima take ya back in the day kind of like this dude..

Now I was jus walkin through cartoon land
When all of a sudden I ran into Sponge Bob Square Pants
He was chillin wit the Power Puff Girls and Spiderman
Drivin down Sesame Street wit Scooby Doo in a mini van
He was rockin to the beat drivin as fast as he can
They almost ran over Ren and Stimpy and HeMan
I yelled at them SLOW DOWN!, but they didn't understand
They said they were headin over to a free hip hop jam
Over in the park, let me catch a ride then
I got in, picked up Bart Simpson and kept drivin
Got to the spot and the part was live and
At the open mic contest Beavis and Butthead were rhymin
I was like, them kids is wack give me jus a try and
Waited patiently til it was just my time and
I told the crowd to make noise get ya hands high and
This is what I said when I grabbed on the mic, I told em..

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
I told the crowd my name is KJ-52
And I came to get down I got something to say to you
Understand what I mean even if you're a cartoon
Jesus reigns supreme that's how my teams comes through
And then all of a sudden these wannabe hard dudes
From South Park walked up just talkin smack too
And the Smurfs backed em up I guess they was just a crew
And said lets battle fool, I said check it out dude
Your five inches tall plus ya'll crew is blue
I'd probably step on all of y'all if I jus battled you
They said La la la la la
that's all you ever say dude
Jus right then, the crowd jus started to boo
Them right of the stage, but I knew jus what to do
I told DJ Voltron, jus on the ones and twos
Man kick the beat check it out this is how I'm rockin you

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
Well the crowd started cheerin the party was slammin
The Thundercats and Pokemon they was breakin dancin
The Transformers hopped in and they were pop lockin
Wit G.I. Joe and Johnny Bravo chillin and jus watchin
I jus stayed on the mic, and kept the speakers knockin
Lettin them know that Christ was the reason that I'm droppin
All these words of life and He's the reason Why I'm rockin
I could go on all night and jus kept talkin
But just right then the Power Rangers started walkin
Up on the stage and said I won the open the mic and
As I reached to get my trophy and jus claim my prize and
Well out of nowhere well this is what happened

And if you love me too, then let me sleep wit you
He's a fool, a lyin schemein dude

Stand up fro yourself tell 'em jus chill wit that
And even if they diss turn around and bless them back
Let me talk smack and leave it at that
Cause everybody ain't doin it now jus learn the facts

Nobody except God should ever tell you how to act

But its the truth and I;ll never back down from that
So if ya can handle that and like the sound of that
Then people holla back on the track that's down wit that

Ladies and gentlemen ya need to stop playin
Stop runnin around always missionary datin
You think that the one you're lovin you gonna be savin
But end up wit problems from the choice that ya makin
Now some y'all girls y'all need to start carin
And think twice about the clothes that you're wearin
I know it might be nice to have all the guy starin
But take advice, respect yourself as a women
We all want love and we all want attention
But that ain't the way to get it you understand what I'm sayin
Wit the baby gap outfit on that ya wearin
Sneakin out the house tryin to hide from ya parents
See God said save yourself for ya marriage
And it was for a reason don't misunderstand it
Sex is a beautiful gift don't mishandle it
Ya better jus check yourself and don't damage it",Check Yourself,2003

Stop fightin, that's what I scream from my bedroom
it seems like lately this is all they ever do
Sayin things to each other like shut up and I hate you
Now every word cuts me deep like knives that stab you
I bury my head under the covers cause I have to
Drown out jus hearin my mother now tellin my dad to
Get out the house, I wonder when I'll get the bad news
I hate it when they scream loud plus when they shout too
I can't stand it when I see, and I really hate the sound too
As these tears run down my eyes until I can't do
Nothin but hope and pray and to try to understand to
I guess I'm gonna have to wait do whatever I can do
I lie in bed and shake cause this ain't what I planned to
Go through, plus I'm only six years old too
And I miss you so much and I jus want to hold you
But on the day you walked out, this is what I told you

[Chorus]
Oh I miss you so much, Mommy please don't go

[KJ-52]
Well you're gone but I see you on the weekends
But you and Dad right now really ain't speakin
And when he drops me off, I can jus feel the tension
Between you and him, but it something I didn't mention
Sometimes I close my eyes and jus start pretendin
That you're back together and I start to imagine
You both pick me up, and you hold me tight and I'm laughin
But when I opened them up I realized it never happened
And deep down inside my own mind I jus feels so sad and
Most of the time in the night I jus wake up cryin
Something ain't right cause now at school I'm fightin
I wish I was someone else and livin some other life and
I'll never forget the day I think I was just nine when
Ya told me the news that you two was divorcin
And I'ma live wit you now cause its the courts orders and
I said this to my dad jus wit tears in my eyes that

Oh I miss you so much, Daddy please don't go

It all changed that year in that one summer
A new family, a stepfather, and a little brother
New neighborhood, new school and a new mother
But how I'm a gonna make it through, now I got to wonder
But out of nowhere you appeared right there
Placed your hands on my face and jus brushed away the tears
Watched it all fade away you just chased away my fears
Showed me for always for all days that your're always here
You told me no matter what my love will never disappear
And there's more then enough you
Demonstrated that you cared
Ya shed the blood of your son, you didn't ever spare
Gave Him up for me, even though it wasn't fair
Ya hung up on a tree where everybody could stare
He died so violently naked and jus bloody there
It was all jus for me nothing even could jus compare
I think back in the day that I used to jus declare that..

KJ-52,"INTRO:
All rise. Case number seven-seven-seven-five-two.
Defendant KJ-52 verses the Son of God in murder one.
How do you plead?
Guilty as charged.
Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Then go ahead.

VERSE 1:
I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth now, so help me God.
What I testify and what I'm speaking of is an eye witness account of an experience of a kindof love,
I confess now to what it was.
I was guilty of making the very Son of God now shed His blood, and
I was guilty of the reason now why He was hung, and
I'm guilty for every evil thing not that I have done.
I'm guilty for it all, I can't blame no one.
I'm filthy with what caused the death of the Son.
It kills me to think I was the one who shed His blood.
I still think of the way He died now and how it was.
It feels me with pain inside, I feel like throwing up.
I can't escape, I can't lie, I didn't make it up.
I was the one who took the life of the Holy One.
This is the first time I've confessed now to what I've done.

CHORUS 1:
I'm guilty, guilty.
That's right, I'm guilty.
God forgive me, I'm guilty.
You know what? I'm guilty!

VERSE 2:
Yeah that's right, I did it.
Right out in the open for all to see it, and
I never hid it, I got to admit it.
They took the whip, ripped His back wide open and split it.
I heard Him cry every time they pulled it back and hit it.
I wondered why He was silent now, I didn't get it.
I watched Him die while He cried out ""It is finished"".
Thought nobody would find out about the the crime I've committed.
I tried to hide out, it's too late, that's right I did this.
It's my time now, my own eyes have been a witness to my crime.
Now I'm speechless and I'm defenseless.
Can anybody find out it's obvious that this is my final time.
Now I've finally come to my senses.
I'm a climb down and take whatever I'm sentenced.
I know why there's no way now that I could miss this.
I opened my eyes, now I see Him just for who He is.
This my guilt is mine now, it's so obvious that...

CHORUS 2:
I'm guilty.
God forgive me, I'm guilty!
I'm guilty.
That's right, I'm guilty.
So help me.

VERSE 3:
I'm just another person, I'm just another man.
I was the one that hurt Him, I finally understand.
Now I know that for certain I caused the nails to land,
That left Him dead and murdered, pierced in feet and hands.
So now you've heard it, I testified and took the stand.
No other way I could word it, this is my confession and,
I never lied or purgured, I told just the best I can but,
I was the one that cursed Him, I was the trigger man.
The page is turning and I've now just confessed to this.
I didn't kill Christ, but it was just my sin that did.
Now I've confessed to the crime, I don't deserve to live, 
I'm ready to do my time. All that I can say is...

CHORUS 3:
I'm guilty.
God forgive me, I'm guilty!
I don't deserve to live, I'm guilty!
Take me away, I'm guilty.
I'm guilty!

Loaded up and I buth like four,
I just kept drinking more and more

Just for some reason I couldn't fall asleep
Mabe it was all the sugar and the caffeine
Not sure but I started to scream...

Well, KJ I know that was painful to talk about
But you CAN overcome it

Cause lately it shows I forget my uh:
Sometimes I feel like my brain is missing
Sometimes I feel like Jessica Simpson
Don't know if tuna's fish or chicken
I told ya it's five two, nobody's listens
Okay, you don't believe that it's true
Even my mom still thinks it's fifty-two
Now I tried to explain but it's no use
At least the kids say 'man your cool, ha'
No, really man, I can't complain
Kids take puff paint and write my name
On their t-shirts and they be like WAH!!!
That's why it's time for me to change

That's what my friends just call me

Now I used to come through my system blasting
People couldn't miss it when I tried to pass them
In a Honda civic with the muffler dragging
Shoes off, hairy feet like Bilbo Baggins
Back when I was living wrong
I need to get tipsy like J-Kwon
But know a days all I need is God
And a mic and a DJ and my I-Pod
All righty put your dance shoes on
And everybody just get your groove on
We'll rock the party till the break of dawn
And even get your grandma to sing along
Now what I say, don't take this lightly
God runs things, not Bruce Almighty
He's Jesus, the only one I need
Now Fivetweezy, y'all know what I mean

With new plans, to expand, to jerk his mans man
We had the ultimate stick up, drop, on the brick pick up
But yo he can't, ''cause he's still locked up
Jump back on the horn ''cause his vibe was strong
Contacted the kid and told him lets be gone
I talked to Poet first, yo son, I got a mish-shon
Grab the ammunnish-shon, pump up your pythons
I know a spot where niggas gettin it, and we can flip on
Son they frustrate me, ''cause these niggas pump with no heat
They play the night time sweet, like they can't get beat
I got their address, to where they rest and stash their shit
Yo, I peeped it out how we can creep, yo yo yo
These niggas stay sleep 
Makin sales, smokin out, and they all get ?geeked?
Lets catch 'em zoning, brain under, high and headed home and
When they least expect it, lets put the gat to his dome

Get the money, couldn't keep it ''cause they jerked it

Is it real, I'm cryin blunt retaliation
Follow ?wallet? for your information

But you never blast a missile, ship your bagette pistol
Gettin scissors on they gun shot wound, you doomed
With no exception

Yo, the streets baptised me to money and war
Gettin yours is a law that we never ignore
We score twice or more, keep it moving twenty-four
We seven days with no rest, still fresh looking
Our names inflamed with the smell of tongue cooking
The hoods rotten, we see the ??? from the crabs plottin
The sneak kill, sabatoge our deal
But we overlook it, 'cause our environment is crooked
And hard to finger who the D's got as a singer
Spillin the beans on the dealers and the fiends
So I move separate and conversate with the connections
On the low key, gettin this money with no exceptions

Chorus

Yeah that's right
We all Screwball up in here
No exceptions baby

Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens

Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough

Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles

When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent

I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and

Niggas smile in ya face, behind yo' back they back-stabbing
Laughing, talkin 'bout all ya business
How much you got to score with, to niggas you went to war with
How many guns you got, and where you go to cop
You shoulda seen me coming down the block
You was gettin hot, but you didn't give a fuck

In a black Benz tinted up, pound of weed twist it up

I seen it all, it went down in my town (Where, where?)

Where some rap kids (Rap kids) can turn to big wigs (Big wigs)

My niggas rollin dice and fled
Braggin to the nigga with the slice in his head
Now there's a price on his head
For pullin out on Lil Bro
Flashin his heat, he askin for beef
Conference call, ready to brawl
Caught him on a Blaz'a

Choice words he spoke, headed for disaster
Last to the gramma I spit
Told him ""Fuck you and whoever you get""
He's like ""Whatever kid""

Til they only child, you pull car you'll get a wild

A wise one, step ahead, keep my fam fed
Broke bread off this game and I held my head
You want details, then lets negotiate crack sales

As he wiped a teardrop from his nose
Upon which his spectacles rose and gazed out to the stars
And like a portrait still he stared
And sighing to himself declared
""I must invent the perfect prayer
Not yours, not mine, but ours

Which in the name of charity
Might lead us to eternal peace
The ultimate philosophy
Some simple, single phrase."" The old and much encumbered man
Then came to rest with head in hand
He thought
And thought
And thought away
His last remaining day
",So Said the Lighthouse Keeper,1977
Klaatu,"We're off you know to a distant land 
And the only ones allowed to come are those who feel they can 
Go right along with the master plan 
For we're all agreed that all we need is sitting there in your head 
(Is that all? That's all. That's all? That's all.) 

So raise the sails and trim all the sheets 
Set your course and jam all the cleats 
We'll follow the north star to know where we are so 
You sleepyheads get out of bed right now 
Let your fortunes be cast to the wind 

And so it's off we go to some uncharted shore 
'Cause the only kind we're out to find are those worth looking for 
You can tag along should you feel the urge to merge 
'Cause we're all agreed that all we need is Hope and a little courage 
(Is that all? That's all. Ooh hoo hoo) 

So raise the sails and trim all the sheets 
Set your course and jam all the cleats 
We'll follow the North Star to know where we are so 
You sleepyheads get out of bed right now 
Get out the lead full steam ahead smartly now 
For the journey begins 
The journey begins 
Our journey begins come the sun 

Well wouldn't you like to go too ...?",We're off You Know,1977
Klaatu,"'Twas one long year today 
I left Bournemouth and you 
Adventure, salt and spray 
King's service I must do 
But dear Christine I hold you dearly 
If only you could hear me 
I send my love sincerely 
In hopes that we're not merely hanging on 

At sea there's time for thought 
My head was filled with you 
With quill in hand I sought 
To bridge the endless blue 

But dear Christine I hold you dearly 
If only you could hear me 
I send my love sincerely 
In hopes that we're not merely hanging on 
On and on 

And dear Christine I'm just a man who 
Believes in dreams that come true 
And if you feel like I do 
When I return I'll find you hanging on 

",Dear Christine,1978
Klaatu,"It happened back in ancient times 
When people worked overtime overtime 
In fact I think in 1985 
Life was busy in the big city 
And the union was sitting pretty 
It wasn't easy to stay alive 
And they'd run from the city to the sun and the country 
And never quite get away 
When the weekend came 
Everybody took a holiday 
Everybody took a holiday 

On a Sunday in July 
Everybody made up their minds 
And when Monday rolled around no one came home 
All the cities and streets were bare 
Everybody was having fun elsewhere 
As the weeks went by no one came home 

And they'd run from the city to the sun and the country 
And never quite get away 
When the weekend came 
Everybody took a holiday 
Everybody took a holiday 

But the world has changed today 
Everyone works in the usual way 
But at least we had one month away 
Things are much much slower now 
People get away anyhow anyhow 
When the weekend comes they take a holiday 

And they run from the city to the sun and the country 
And never quite get away 
When the weekend comes 
Everybody takes a holiday 
Everybody took a holiday 
Everybody took a holiday",Everybody Took a Holiday,1978
Klaatu,"He looks at the girls with his evil eye 
Makes them wish they was someplace else 
He'll twist their thoughts with his pretty words 
Make them extensions of himself 
He's the reincarnation of Hitler 
The daughter of the devil all right 
Let me ask you Mister Manson 
Do you sleep at night? 
Well he'd like to melt your mind with hydrochloric 
Acid in a little pill 
He'll take a thing called love and make you hate it 
And claim to cure your ills 
He took the madness of a generation 
And made them madder still 
Tell me won't you Mister Leary 
Keep your little pills 

He'll fill you with his empty statements 
Directed to a fool 
Then he'll ignore his own unending speeches 
And bend the golden rule 
In the name of God he'll tell you 
That he's better than all the rest 
Let me tell you Mister Manson 
Jesus has been and left 
Let me tell you Mister Manson 
Jesus has been and left",Mister Manson,1978
Klaatu,"Older 
It seems like each day you get older 
And each day the world becomes colder 
In a cynical way 
Time 
Do you feel like you've missed your time? 
I feel like I've missed mine 
And I'm losing my way 

I think it's time you realized 
For I can see it in your eyes 
You seem convinced that you will live forever 

Over 
I feel like my life has blown over 
I keep looking over my shoulder 
And seeing nothing but grey 

It's a crime 
Don't it seem like such a crime 
I wish I had more time 
But I'm drifting away 

Older 
You see it's like I told you 
You've gained the right to grow older 
By living today 

I think it's time you realized 
For I can see it in your eyes 
You seem convinced that you will live forever

Klaatu,"Send your dollars or your moms and fathers 
For there's something you should own 
You can have one today just send right away 
We deliver right to your home 
You can't get better value for your money 
Than you get right here 
You don't have to see it to know you need it 
It's all the rage this year 
You can have your own, very own perpetual motion machine 

What a nice surprise it's just the right size 
For someone just like you 
It's just what you need and it's guaranteed 
To do exactly what it will do 
It stays together it'll last forever 
Which is something new these days 
One thing about it you can live without it 
But you'll order one today 

You can have your own, very own perpetual motion machine",Perpetual Motion Machine,1978
Klaatu,"It started off a routine day 
I got through the morning in the usual way 
I caught the bus on time 
Good morning, Mr. Driver, drive 
As I sat inside my overcoat I clutched my cane 
And pressed my nose against the foggy window pane 
Ho hum 
The life I lead would even make a dead man yawn 
Midday comes 
I break for lunch 
With my sandwich and a beer I go on a hunch 
To the park where I hope to find 
A little bit of peace of mind 

As I sat there on a bench amidst the rodent race 
I felt a strange sensation that without a trace appeared 
But then as quickly disappeared again 

So tell me what's the bloody point of playing the game 
With so much to lose yet so little to gain 
You sell your life away 
Can't you see you're just a cog working like a dog 
You trade your future for a dead-end job 
That's full of routine days 
Routine days 

I race the clock to the end of my day 
The paycheck in my pocket makes me feel okay 
But was it worth the grind 
Just to keep from falling behind 
I stand here in the queue behind a foul cigar 
My face discreetly buried in a book on Mars 
Humdrum 
And I'm waiting on the pier 'til Charon comes",A Routine Day,1978
Klaatu,"Right now if we wait for the opportunity 
Then we would see the sun is reversing 
Right now if we wait for the opportunity 
Then we would see the sun is reversing 
Ahh plasticine walls forever and overly happy 
With your aloof scene 
Go off the ledge to snow 
Wish them goodnight 
Oh gorgeous madman 
You're illuminated 

Ahh if he preached the words they beat on 
And ignored him with their moral in lust 
Whose four-inch dagger 
Blind your mothers eye to stop 
Ooh are you ugly 
Silly boys love you 

Yeah sit up they're armed with hooks 
They'll harm her 
You're smashed with ignace 
Hark and enamour me 
May I survive? 
Ah Sir Army Suit 
You're psychic

Klaatu,"It doesn't really matter where you are
You could be living on a distant star
Just as long as you're feeling right
You could be happy on this fine night
If you just use a little imagination
And put your mind in a new situation
You could be tripping through the galaxy
Lost in a dream just you and me

(chorus)
You reach your arms up to the sky
And cast your love across the universe
You're feeling happy but you don't know why
And we'll go dancing on the distant dog star with you

As we go traveling through time and space
And leave the earth to the human race
On our approach to the dog star
We can see the Milky War bar
On a planet in a new constellation
We begin a great celebration
We will sing and dance until the day
For tomorrow is a week away

(chorus)

Step out on the floor feel light on your feet
Anti-gravity's on can't sit in your seat
You're so far from home and all at once you know
That you're not ready to go you want to stay here for the rest of your life

Just as long as you're feeling right
You could be happy on this fine night
You could be tripping through the galaxy
Lost in a dream just you and me

(chorus)

",Dog Star,1980
Klaatu,"She was a sleek and slender enchantress 'd met at the Casbah
When her green eyes first met mine I was overwhelmed with awe
Well we danced all night to the tango and she lured me with her charms
As the band played how I prayed I'd awaken in her arms

(chorus)
And then I howled at the moon I knew that something was wrong
She'd had me in a spell and I knew it wouldn't be too long
Before I'd end up before I'd end up here in a prison cell
Oh here in a prison cell

And while we danced she swayed like a cobra you could almost hear her hiss
As her green eyes hypnotized it was useless to resist
Well she drove me home in her Jaguar and she took me to her room
Though it all seems like a dream it was there I met my doom

(chorus)

When she said, ""Come my little fly
Come now don't be shy
Just step into my web""
I could feel my future fold as I blacked out cold
When I came to she was dead

(chorus)

",Howl at the Moon,1980
Klaatu,"I just can't help myself
You've got control of me
I'm not the kind who likes to hang around

I should walk away
But something's telling me to stay

I can't help it
I can't help it if I love you
I can't stop it
And I'm not gonna try to
I can't help it
I can't help it if I love you
Got to fill this emptiness inside

I just can't help myself

A major catastrophe
It's getting out of control

Klaatu,"Hello sweet Joan so glad you're home
Just called to say goodbye
I'm leaving town I'm bent and bound
Don't try to change my mind
You ask me why I'm leaving
But we both know the reason

You're knee deep in love
Guess it's over and done for us, you and me
You're knee deep in love
But I'm not the one
I'm not the one I know

Isn't it strange how people change
And slowly drift apart like you and me
It had to be I've known it from the start
You're trying not to show it
But in my heart I know it

(chorus)

It's in the way you hold me
And in the lies you've told me
Everything I do seems to
Annoy you and displease you
You never share your laughter
And on the morning after
You try to sweep me under your rug
You don't have to say it

Klaatu,"Lately when I'm talking
I've been talking to myself
My friends say they don't notice
But they do 'cause I can tell
I wake up mad every morning
And I go to bed mad at night
My mind ain't functioning poorly
But it sure ain't feeling right
No it sure ain't feeling right

I went to see my doctor
I told him I'd been feeling blue
He shook his head and simply said
Ain't nothing he could do
Well my head aches with apprehension
Till I can't take any more pain
If I don't get some attention soon
I think I'll go insane
Yes I think I'll go insane

I feel you creeping through my soul, yeah
Paranoia
I feel you taking complete control, oh
Paranoia
You got me running all the time, paranoia
Paranoia
Oh what a pitiful state of mind

Don't know how long I've been this way
My mind is so confused
It seems the whole world's after me
No matter what I do

No, I can't remember
When it's ever been this bad
But lately I've felt feelings
That I never knew I had
Delusions of persecution haunt me
My one companion is fear
And there's always someone behind me
When I check my rear-view mirror
I better check my rear-view mirror

Klaatu,"Well the other night my automobile broke down on the road
I had to walk a mile before I found a telephone
I said, ""Hello Operator, your phone just ate my dime.""
A tape machine said, ""Sorry, sir"" and then hung up the line

Do you ever wanna shout
I'm not gonna take it anymore, yeah
But you never let it out
You're too busy crawling back for more

Gonna set the world on fire
Gonna stand and watch it burn
Gonna get my heart's desire
And I don't care who gets hurt
(Gonna set the world on) Fire

On Friday afternoon I went to get my paycheck cashed
I needed money badly with the weekend coming fast
I lined up for an hour but when my turn arose
The teller said, ""I'm sorry, sir, this wicket's just been closed.""

Do you ever wanna shout
I'm not gonna take it anymore, yeah
But you never let it out
You're too busy crawling back for more

(chorus)

Don't you ever wanna shout
I'm not gonna take it anymore, yeah
Go ahead and let it out
I'm fed up with crawling on the floor

So you've had one of those nights (one of those nights)
When you can't do nothin' right (nothin' right)
And your luck's been running bad (running bad)
And it makes you kinda mad (kind of mad)
When everybody say
Don't let your frustrations get the best of you
Use a little patience and they'll melt like morning dew
