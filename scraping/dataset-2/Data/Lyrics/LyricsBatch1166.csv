The Ordinary Boys,"This is a song for all of my close friends
Anonymous neighbors with stories to tell
I didn't realize I had so many close friends nameless and shameless with hear say to sell.

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know I'll never get it
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my hearts not in it

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much, but its never enough,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely at the top.

Oh oh, oh oh.

This is a song for all the complainers
All the campaigners who will not give up
They're selling their souls just to wear their sunglasses
They say ""stop the press, I want to get off""

What's the fuss? I've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know il never get it
Shame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my hearts not in it

If only it was lonely at the top I've got too much, but its never enough,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know I'll never get it
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my hearts not in it.

Oh oh, oh oh

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much but its never enough,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely at the top,
If only it was lonely

Oh oh, oh oh
If only",Lonely at the Top,2006
The Ordinary Boys,"I wake up late every morning
Managers calling I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeups
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
(Hold on I was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent I'm being polite)
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be

Oh my gosh my days are getting longer and
There's no turning back 'cause I'm working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant one thirty
I'm no early birdy I'm working da nine to five

(So you gotta...do...sum...ite... for...channel...u
Channel who sorry who I'm altered for snooze
Oh! Channel you da ones dat made me huge
Like Katie Prices boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my red bull and my sandwich I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting like pampers throwing a tantrum
""Action""
Nah Id actually rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up actually looks quite sweet)

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say nine I meant one thirty
I'm no early birdy I'm working da nine to five

I'm not sure what day just started
Since my working week departed
Ever since our single charted
This pursuit's been everlasting
I clocked in about a year ago
And I haven't clocked out from the studio
Videos and tv shows
Staring out the window on the road
Now there's sometimes we don't get faithful
Those rampages on those stages
I know that I won't get jaded
I won't go back to my minimum wages

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say nine I meant one thirty
I'm no early birdy I'm working da nine to five

Oh my gosh my days are getting longer and

The Ordinary Boys,"The only thing I ever wanted
The only thing I ever needed
Is my own way, I gotta have it all

I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas
Stay the fuck out of my face, stay away from me
I am my own God, I do as I please

Just wipe your own ass and shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

My mind is playing tricks on me
I am not as stable as I used to be
Pushed and shoved, you know you're going too far

I will not break my back for you no more
I am gonna go my way, I am gonna take control
Time to wake up and dig myself out of this hell

Just wipe your own ass and shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around
Shut your mouth

You're getting what your ego deserves
Shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

The Ordinary Boys,"I cross my fingers on a Monday morning 
I keep on smiling and I keep on singing 
So sure that I don't deserve it 
My throat aches and my ears are ringing 

Believing in coincidence 
In running risks not common sense 
In the wrong place at the right time 
I'll take the blame 'cause it's all mine 

We've got the best job ever 
It will be over sooner or never 
At the risk of sounding clever 
I want the best job ever forever 

We've got the best job ever, oh oh
We've got the best job ever, oh oh

I try to stop myself from being boring 
And try to remind myself who is laughing 
I try to act like it's not so exciting 
Desperate that my 15 seconds is passing 

Though what it's luck we rely on 
A force so weak it seems so strong 
In the right place at the wrong time 
I'll take the chance the choice is mine 

We've got the best job ever 
It will be over sooner or never 
At the risk of sounding clever

The Ordinary Boys,"I've had nights I will never forget
I've had nights I will always regret
But I can take it on the chin and say...
Boys will be boys 
There's been girls that have stolen our hearts
But their arms simply couldn't be prized apart
They will never let us in and say
Boys will be boys 

Well it's under my skin so I could never win, oh thanks a lot
We cheat and we lie and we fight, we don't cry but we try
Ha! 

I felt driven and I felt obliged
I've had feeling like thorn in my side
I hope you never let us down now
Boys will be boys 

Blinded by sorrow I could hardly restrain
Everywhere there's guilt labored with pain
Chin up, chin up now
Boys will be boys 

(Ranking Junior)
Ah you said, you better move out the way
I come to keep the people rocking and sway
I'm well serious, I'll never ever play
Boys will be boys, and there's nothing you can say (way) 

Spread the word I'll cross the land
Must make people understand
Wish I had a magic wand
To connect people united as one 

This goes out to all the girls
On the mic might send you round the bend
Boys will be boys, listen right to the end! 

Well it's under my skin so I could never win, oh thanks a lot

The Organ,"Day after day , they go
They go to gain just a 
Little more control
And when they took yours away
I couldn't sleep at all
I lay in bed for days


I died a sudden death
I made an awful mess
I didn't stand a chance
I didn't stand a chance
‘Cause when we where our best

I could care less if people 
Bred themselves to death
Oh, but now that you are gone
I just know that everything is wrong
Don't leave me alone now",A Sudden Death,2004

Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will

Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And will never part

Love me tender, love me true

The Organ,"Here we go
They're back again
Look alive , warn your friends
We are warm and we are safe
Enjoy it while you can before
Things change

We have got to take cover,
Brother
We have got to take cover,
Brother

Lie down in a field if you can
Look at the night sky
Oh, where does it end?
Sometimes it hurts when you
Care about me
But it's going to hurt more when
They take you away from me
We have go to take cover, brother
We have got to take cover, brother

Here we go again
Oh midnight knocks!
Oh explosions!
Maybe it's all made up in our heads
This happens to me when I'm bored
Or depressed

Here is the best part of the song
Where I admit that I might be wrong
Because if they are good and if
They are right
Then they'll have their rapture one
Of these nights
But if they are wrong",Brother,2004
The Organic Boogie Band,"Low down leaving sun
Done, did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't I see?
I'd best be leaving well enough alone

Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Keep a-haunting me in memories
Well is one in every crowd for crying out loud
Why was it always turning out to be me?

Where does it go? The good Lord only knows
Seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay

Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For lovable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

The Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers,"There's a meeting in Lone Pine today and no one knows
See the wind along the highway how it goes
And some days the trucks roll over
There's a bistash orchard hidden in the Yucca mountains
See the heartbreak in the farmer he is told
These are hard times to start over
Lets climb to the top of this dried grass hill
Before we rambled there was silence
There's silence still
Why do you suppose he waits by the road
All he wanted was to land a little farm
There's a meeting in Lone Pine
He'll have to start over
And who'll be there to guide us
There's a dollar bill that costs a lot of dawn in some
In the ground is water moving all around
Let's climb to the top of this dried grass hill
Before we rambled there was silence
There's silence still
Why do you suppose he waits by the road
All he saved for was to land a little farm

Glad that you showed me how
To get out of the cold

And I will miss your dear sweet smile

There's a lot of light

But no rain in the sky

A friend comes by and we keep him inside

The dogs are chasing the furrows


CHORUS:

If you look now you'll see I'm on your side

Each cloud that passes us by

Trying to find the rainbows of your heart

Hope all these words I say will hurry home

And I'll show you that I care

There's an off road down in the wash

The blackbirds stayed all winter long

We dragged out an old army cot

We faced it east to see the sun rise

There's no red sky this morning

Rosalee won't even leave her home

She's scared she won't get back

Inside the door

Rivers will bend people sometimes get stuck in

The whirling cloud

You'll have to show her how to get around

Rosalee can talk a mean blue streak

There's fifty reasons why she won't go see

The way the world will change

Can get under someone's skin

When it changes on them

You'll have to show her how to get around

Someone there to tell you it's alright

Won't make the town seem so far

If you won't feel so all alone

You're no longer hiding inside your home

Winds blowing inside of the car

There's a dust storm rising ten feet tall

It's a wonder we don't make this trip more

Foolish I guess

You'll have to show her how to get around

There's someone there to tell you it's alright

Won't make the town seem so far

But you won't feel so all alone

You're no longer hiding inside your home


There's someone there to tell you it's alright

There's someone there to tell you it's alright

There's someone there to tell you it's alright

Who brings the rain that washes down the road

Of paradise, where roses grew

The Originals,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.",Winter Wonderland,1963

All the time, I want the sunshine. Sure enough, I'm alone in the dark.

And though I always try, I can't fly away.

It's where your dreams will never die.

Let me realize the feeling of having just one good memory.

Can I get by? Will I survive in the middle of a jungle?

I put in other people I never thought of shunning.
Now I get the feeling that I should be a-running.
A half a million tigers to live within the city, 
To see us in the jungle isn't very pretty. 
Can I get by? Will I survive in the middle of the jungle?

Can I get by? Will I survive walkin' in the middle of a jungle?

It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be,
Here is what Christmas time means to me.

City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style.
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas.

Children laughing, people passing,
Meeting smile after smile,
And on every street corner you'll hear:

Silver bells, silver bells,
It's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.

City street lights,
Even stop lights,
Blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures.

Hear the snow crunch,
See the kids bunch,
This is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you'll hear:

At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending a of perfect day

At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop!

When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie

He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man""

When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

But nobody wants to go home now; there's too much goin' on
This night is gonna last forever.  Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up the radio is gonna play that song
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
 
Lord, I know. There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright, so turn out the light, and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache to night, I know
 
Somebody's gonna hurt someone before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone; there's nothin' we can do
Ev'rybody wants to touch somebody, if it takes all night
Ev'rybody wants to take a little chance, make it come out right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
Let's go. We can beat around the bushes; we can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot, but either way
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know

A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.

It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd,2010

The Out-Islanders,"First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

So try to realize all the things we've got
How come you don't understand?

There'll never be a future we can trust
Tomorrow's all we need in front of us
One day at a time's enough

And my love for you
Well, it's still as new
And it's burning blue

I shoulda known better
Why can't I forget her
She's an operator

And my love for you
It still feels as new
And it's burning blue

All across the nation
Open invitation
No exaggeration

I shoulda known better
Why can't I forget her
She's an operator

And my love for you
It's still burning blue

Sinner man, he's telling you it's never enough
Nobody there, inside the mind he wasted

In a city where it's all gone wrong
Too many people and they don't belong
Suffocating on the air they breathe
Selling their souls for the magic seed

Pretty girl, standing in a doorway
At a price, offering a bed for the night
Nobody cares, a sign of the life she's wasted

In a city where it's all gone wrong
Too many people and they don't belong
Suffocating on the air they breathe
Selling their souls for the magic seed

So afraid, nowhere else to go now
Far far away, there's a place
That you once called home but

In a city where it's all gone wrong
Too many people and they don't belong
Suffocating on the air they breathe
Selling their souls for the magic seed

In a city where it's all gone wrong
Too many people and they don't belong
Suffocating on the air they breathe

Heading on out to the shoreline
The graytown boys are tired of this place
They're not coming back anymore

Gonna find a new life in the city
Don't wanna live in black and white
'Cause nothing's gonna change, the talkin's over
Too many wasted years gone by

The raintown boys ain't coming back to town no more
They've had enough of living in the past for sure

The sadtown girls are crying inside
Thoughts are out there in the darkness
They'd given their hearts to the boys in the past
Now it's so lonely without them

It's late at night but downtown in the city
They walk the streets, the lights turn red
A broken voice in their imagination
They can't believe the things she said

I can give you more than anyone can
Perfect strangers living in a new land

The raintown boys are so far away
Been living it up on the shore
No doubt in their minds they're all gonna stay
There's nothing left to go home for

They've found a better life inside this city
Their fears are gone, their fortunes changed
Just like they were made for one another
The boy's won't ever be the same

The raintown boys ain't coming back to town no more
They've had enough of living in the past for sure

And he rides just as fast as he knows

In the small town missionary hall
Back seat teaser never takes any money

Riding in a big flash car
Sets his eyes on the good time seeker
She jumps inside but they go too far

Kinda' sorry for the things that they did

Walks like a woman and acts like a man
One hot country, this is just one hot country
This is just one hot country in modern times

Well if you don't like the movie just watch the news instead
And if you wanna be a star, hijack a DC 10
But if you change your occupation, you might be fallin' from the sky
A silent girl's imagination, silhouettes the world goodnight

I feel so many things that I don't understand
Walks like a woman and acts like a man

This is just one hot country in modern times
One hot country, this is just one hot country

Don't get me wrong
'cos you're not the only girl I've ever had
But since you've been gone

By the time our number's up, we could be gone

Breaks the silence
Beats against my window
As the moment slips away
And I just can't explain
In your absence there is nothing
I try in vain - but I can't kiss the rain

And a miracle can stay
In my mind forever more
It can take my blues away
But it can't stop the rain
And it won't stop me crying
As the rhythm starts again
Inside my head

The rhythm of your name
Undecided uninvited
Speaks to me just like you? re here again
And I just can't remain
Undecided unprovided
So in vain I tried to kiss the rain

And an orchestra can play
Any song I've ever heard
But they? ll never know my name
And they can't stop the rain
And they won't stop me crying
Oh the rhythm of the rain

Unstained heart ­ untamed dreams
Unchained love ­ forever

With open arms and love in her eyes

And white lines are in my eyes

Twenty-some odd years ago
Ran away for the first time honey
When I was four years old

I'm a freeborn man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway, 
Every foot of back road
Every mile of railroad track.

I got a lady in Cincinnati
A woman in San Anton'
I always love the gal next door
Honey, every place is home

I'm a freeborn man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway, 
Every foot of back road
Every mile of railroad track.

You may not like the way I look
You may not like my song
You may not like the way I Live
You'll love the way I'm gone

I'm a freeborn man
Home is on my back
I know every inch of highway, 
Every foot of back road
Every mile of railroad
Every mile of railroad
Every mile of railroad track

 I got an itchy feelin' under my skin
 so I grabbed my rags and packed my bags
 and got back on the road again
  to look for paradise, I'm needin' sugar and spice
 I'm really needin' a holiday
 
 Verse 2:
 My main concern was which direction to turn
 I was lookin' forward to the treat
 there's no parallel, it's stranger than hell
 pull the rug from under my feet
 I've been lovin' everything in sight
 still this time I knew the feelin' was
 'cause I wanted everyday to be
 
 Chorus:
  A holiday, when it's in paradise
 well love's a holiday, when it's a sugar and spice
 
 Bridge:
 It's sweet as a stolen kiss
 and it's strange in it's own special way
 love, love, love's a holiday
 
 Verse 3:
 Now it don't seem strange that the more I change
 the more the feelin' inspires
 understandin's what a man protects (protests?)
 love's what his poor soul desires
 I've been lovin' everything in sight
 now this time I knew the feelin' was right
 'cause I know that everyday can be

Ooh, ooh, Hurry Sundown
She had hair as black as darkness, eyes of emerald green 
And her voice was soft and tender, oooh she could sing 
She will sing no more, or dance again or shake a tambourine 
They had taken her away, she was dead and gone, hear the gypsies sing

Silver devils in his holsters, stars strapped to his heels 
There was fire in his eyes, they say that he was dressed to kill

The Outlaws,"Another night with open eyes
Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughin' stock
Because you dance to disco and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you and even in bed
Said, ""She was gonna go and get herself a real man instead""

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish
But that's childish, so childish

Remember when you were more easily led
Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

It was love and now you can't pretend
You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's not enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

Ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
And ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Or do you want revenge?

Feelin' good like I should

Held me close within her arms

I'm gonna break down and cry

Set out to find the gambler
Who murdered their pa

And his trail was leadin' west
He'd left there many months ago
And so they couldn't rest

Who killed their pa in New Orleans

And the nights were cold as steel
Hate was strong and youth was wild
And so they couldn't feel

Gotta find the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

His trail led to the Badlands
And the desert promised death
The gambler's odds were different now
He treasured every breath
Five brothers and three in their teens
Close behind the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans
New Orleans

When first they saw the killer
He was by the waterhole
Five rifles rang out through the night
They killed the gambler cold
Five brothers and three in their teens
Finally got the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

The desert is their keeper now
For this a traveler said
That poison lived within the hole
Now six of them are dead

Lay beside the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans
Lay beside the man
Who killed their pa in New Orleans

It's been so long since I've seen my home
Got to get on down that road tonight
The one I love is waitin' there for me
With open arms and love in her eyes

Seeing the days and the nights pass me by
I've been seeing the road signs
And white lines are in my eyes

This is pony boy breaker down
I'm goin' home

You know I've tried to make the best of it
But there's somethings a man's just got to do

And I'll be there before the mornin' dew

Lookin' over my shoulder now

 I'm really needin' a holiday
 
 Verse 2:
 My main concern was which direction to turn
 I was lookin' forward to the treat
 there's no parallel, it's stranger than hell

 I've been lovin' everything in sight
 still this time I knew the feelin' was
 'cause I wanted everyday to be

  A holiday, when it's in paradise
 well love's a holiday, when it's a sugar and spice

 It's sweet as a stolen kiss
 and it's strange in it's own special way
 love, love, love's a holiday
 
 Verse 3:
 Now it don't seem strange that the more I change
 the more the feelin' inspires
 understandin's what a man protects (protests?)
 love's what his poor soul desires
 I've been lovin' everything in sight
 now this time I knew the feelin' was right
 'cause I know that everyday can be

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Every mile of railroad track.

A woman in San Anton'

He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you.""

And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done.""

When your ears are blind
It's a scream, baby

Would you love me anymore
If I wore a mask would you know

Would you love me anymore

Ahhh ... Ahhh ...
Ah, Ah, Ahhh ... Ahhh ...


The heat of a summer day, poundin' down on my back,
Work like a dog in the sunlight, tryin' to pay the people back.
I killed a man in the spring time; Had to work hard just to make a dime,
To buy my baby the things that she needs.
I guess I didn't think twice, and now I have to pay the price,
For killing a man of another creed.


Ahhh ... Ahhh ...
Ah, Ah, Ahhh ... Ahhh ...


I guess I'll have to be strong, the rest of my life can't be too long.
I know I'll die some day, and be going far away,
And you won't remember the things that I've done.
I feel a shedding tear, it's only been a year,
But I know I'll be dead when the evening comes.


Ahhh ... Ahhh ...
Ah, Ah, Ahhh ... Ahhh ...


I guess I'll have to be strong, the rest of my life can't be too long.

When I monkey-wrenched your circuitry.
And when they finally got to me,
I had built a monster worse than me,
And far worse than you.

And I have become such an ungrateful man -
Just to steal those words you whispered out,
And I snickered in between.
The check point, the boot hill, the ass in me
Says some things still best left unsheathed,
Or out come the knives.

So, retire to your ant hill,
Or cover tire tracks,
And learn to choke it back.
And when they get to you, they'll see
I did a terrible thing,
With a sober mind.

Make no mistake;
I just couldn't stop the hand.
But when you're happy and you're safe,
You'll do anything to keep it that way.

So, do you need the baseball bat,
Or do you need something elite?
Do you need that to feel safe?
Do you need that to feel safe?

(for example)
Last night I took my sharpest blade,
And I cut my tent another five inch slit
To make sure I get away.

And when our weary heads
Hit our sleeping bags,
The brutal honesty
Can tend to spill out, and me
I like to whisk you all away -
Whisk you all away
With my terrible mind.

And when they finally get past
All of your once tightly seriesed,
The check, the point, the charlies.

And when we finally
And when they finally get past
All of your once tightly seriesed,
The check, the point, the charlies.

And when we finally
Get past their doors,
We can hate these sinners
The way we hurt our fathers.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Des ennuis, des chagrins s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Des mots de tous les jours

At what, I often wonder

By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

A penny for his thoughts can make you richer
His eyes can see what other eyes could not

But not mere power, but magnetism
And magnetism is more intelligent than force

To you and all your family, your neighbors and your friends
May all your days be happy with a joy that never ends
May peace and love surround you
At Christmas time and all the whole year through

I'm looking out my window at the softly falling snow
That dances in the early morning light
I got my guitar right before me, strummin' a beautiful sound
Watching it a-comin' down, all around
On the fields, and the farms, and the road to town

And I'm thinkin' up a letter that I'm writin' in my head
A Christmas card to all the folks I love
Instead of lettin' the postman bring it
I decided I'd rather sing it
Especially for you, for you

May your life be filled with sunshine, may your every wish come true
May you find the sweet fulfillment in everything you do
May your days be blessed with the very, very best
Both now and the whole year through

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Said take off your shoes and come on inside

Saw the northern lights on a Minnesota night

It couldn't climb in Montana

What the heck, I'll give you a thirty five

Had our thumbs to take us home to California
By the time we made Denver
With our truck drivin' friend we had wheels on fire

From my hammock down my tree and into Melbourne town
Now first stop hit Kanelata to Tedesco land
To down that show - with 2 shoes and a magic hand man
Now it's a plan as flamenco turns to -down shakin
There's a jazz jam and Julie's got the whole joint bakin'
And anyone who's fakin' gets a quick anihilation
As we movin' destinations on the music train station singing
'on and on and on'. ""on and on and on""
Checkin' checkin' out Mr Askey's song cos he's
Late sevens' captain-on-the-mic but blows the horn so fierce
That the room ignite
It's like his shuffle got us thinking about dowing the down low so where we go?
We take the night cat stop for the cabrones show
And here's the point I stop reciting start to dance instead
I heard the city of the deep blue lights it said:
Now get the party started

It wasn't hard to get the party started

Chillin' at the club, pimpin' with my money
Well actually, my parties are more like
Chillin' in the sun with tea and milk and honey
Tea and lamingtons, that's my idea of fun
But I do enjoy the odd ocaasional bottle of rum
As we learn in the songs that I have previously sung
When it's done with fruit juice at a barbecue in the sun
If afternoon is begun with kangaroo and capsicum
I do eat meat but I don't like killing
So don't crash my party while I'm sitting back chilling
My oh my why oh why are people so violent
I ain't trying to be a lion I extend my alliance
To anyone who like to just sit back and chitchat
Maybe have a jam, spit scats and eat biscuits
Before you know it's midnight and you're running through the moonlight
And you realize

It wasn't hard to get the party started

The house party started about eleven or so
Got a call from Krido to tell me that
Dubwo and Hendo started it blow by blow
Notw it's a dancehall rockin' like a Cuban mojo
So bring ya go-go's and your special friends
I've never been diving but I get the bends
When schlam and Mick and Fairooz making the soul news
See we got the bomb track and the D-floor's the fuse

A Party H-A-P-P-E-N-I-N-G and it's a

The only thing I bring my heart is misery
I can't hold on to you no matter how I try
The only time your lips meet mine is when I'm gettin' kiss goodbye

Someone always gets to hold you in their arms it seems
While I'm left to hold the back of broken dreams
Will my eyes get all the tears and my head gets all the aches
And my heart poor old heart gets all the breaks

My heart keeps begging me to stay away from you
It knows darn well you're only out to make me blue

You are so sweet to love
But we're never never really together

You're my one the only dear to me
A thousand miles across the sea
You're not here, I'm not there
We're apart and I'm lonely

Let's do some truthful talking
Cause I'm getting tired of walking nowhere;
This framework doesn't work
Kick the dragon, nothing else I'm fired up truck
You're not here, I'm not there
We're apart",Mandarin,1995

And gravitation, cause I don't want you to fall

The Pastels,"It might not last
So we're gonna record everything

Trip the power on
And we'll set up our equipment

It's an outside chance
That the light will be reflected
And our lives will be connected
In the same sphere, as we glance each other's eyes

Open up the mic
'Cause we're gonna record everything

The Pastels,"Take your shoes off
Step this way
To the waterfall and back

Catch your breath
Along the way
Watching insects
Inch their way

Is done
We'll ride in to
The milky sun

A whim the air is all
Drawing circles
Venture softly
We're there
In a moment
There'll be moments
To share

Looking from your
Dark window
Do you miss the city flow?

Sometimes at night
A swim a whim cath fire
Press your face
Against the glass
Soon a hundred years
Will pass
Open the door
Make up for times missing
Found a need
I never knew
I can't imagine
Passing through

And your unknowing smile
Unrolling unknowning
We're there
In a moment
There'll be moments

The Pastels,"Take my hand and take my heart
I shiver when you're near
Deliver me from everything that drives me, oh my dear

Accelerate your pain
White knuckles on the wheel again
Shut your mouth, let's move on out of here
Just try and keep it light
Or someone may get hurt tonight
Don't talk that way, don't talk that way, don't talk that way

Hold it there a second
Let me dump this stupid pride
I'm ready for you sweet-heart
Now my mind is open wide

Shut up and make it count
Your concentration paramount
Remember what was meant to be this year
The past is a disaster
And the future's coming faster now
What do you say we go and get a beer?

Simply nothing to be done
Oh tell me i'm the only one
Simply nothing to be done
Tell me I'm the only one

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away

To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

The Pat Moran Quintet,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Beautiful to take a chance

Power in the hands of a worker
But it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand
There is power in a union

Now the lessons of the past were all learned with workers' blood
The mistakes of the bosses we must pay for
From the cities and the farmlands to trenches full of mud
War has always been the bosses' way, sir

The Union forever defending our rights
Down with the blackleg, all workers unite
With our brothers and our sisters from many far off lands
There is power in a union

Now I long for the morning that they realise
Brutality and unjust laws can not defeat us
But who'll defend the workers who cannot organise
When the bosses send their lackeys out to cheat us?

Money speaks for money, the Devil for his own
Who comes to speak for the skin and the bone
What a comfort to the widow, a light to the child
