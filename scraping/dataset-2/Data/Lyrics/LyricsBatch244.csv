Everett Barksdale,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1974
Everett Bradley,"Let me introduce to you
A brand new dance I got for you
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! That's nice!

Stomp your boot heels on the floor
Do the Geordie Stomp some more
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! So nice!

Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!
Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!

Next your hands go in the air
Shake 'em, snake 'em anywhere
Stomp on, stomp on, stomp on
Stomp on, stomp on
Alright! That's nice!

When the night comes to the end
You will find a brand new friend

Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends

And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule

Everett Greene,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1998
Everett Greene,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1998
Everett Greene,"I used to dream about angels But then I never knew
That I'd ever meet one And such a sweet one
Till I met you

When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things
Where di you hide your Halo?

Where did you lose your wings?
Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?

Everett Greene,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

Everett Greene,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

Something takes possession over me
I remember when the nightmares began
On that cold night of December 26th

I don't know what it is but I lost all control
Can't you see I'm condemned by the past that
They close in my history I don't want to be like
This no more you can't see what I mean but you
Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen

I cross my heart in hope to see
What I saw was not a part of me
Dig inside yourself and you shall feel
But dig to deep and you become like me

I hate to see one more get lost like I

Evil words are spoken makes me fear
The world that now reigns over me
I was strong but now weak and I fall with my tears
Can't you please make the demons leave me be

Can't you see I'm condemned by the past that
They close in my history I don't want to be like
This no more you can't see what I mean but you
Would if you saw all the sight that I have seen

Please don't let your eyes meet mine
I have seen it all before
Cause the eyes mirror the soul

Leave that guilt stained cross behind
Free your arms do it one by one

It's not your fault, you are not to blame
Your wing clipped past should not bring you shame
And the years that you still endured
Should work as strength to see past it all

Come feel my sorrow and my tears
My broken wings can't hold my weight
Through the dark of day

All hope's been burnt to ashes
And I'm so tired of hiding the bruises
My broken wings can't take me
Through the dark of day

The pain inflicted is just false relief
Precious moments where you can dream
Of a day when you too can feel

Come feel my sorrow and my tears

And how we should rise to see you walk the water?
Can you deny my hopes when
'Cause all you really did was just to make it hurt?

Did you think of all the blame that you left me with?
Did you think of all the guilt that I now feel?
I thought that I was close as someone ever get
I was so wrong to think that I knew you

So now I relive that moment everyday
Asking forgiveness for the things that I never got to say
And how will I ever rid the thoughts
Or even make them fade away?

How can you deny me hope and
And how we should rise to see you walk the water?
Could you forsake all hope to fail
And all you really ever achieved was to make me fall into the water?

And how could you give up the chance to make this work again?
And why 'cause all you really did was to just make us fall into the water
Would you not offer me the chance to prove I've changed?
And how 'cause all you really did was just to make us fail

",Fail,2008
Evergrey,"I have forsaken you
And all I ever felt was true
To take that step and fall
To aim beyond these walls

With hope that the stars align
To get a glimpse of my goal defined
I stare the eyes of my biggest fear
Swallow pride, I'll persevere

I fear my heart, fear my soul
I fear I'm weak, I'm fearing you, I fear the cold
That the world is yours, that I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong that I don't belong, I fear the cold

All nights of fallen grace
All nights where I lost the trace
All I need is that single hour
Where all doubt's erased

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

But I fear my heart, fear my soul
I fear I'm weak, I'm fearing you, I fear the cold
That the world is yours, that I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong and I don't belong, I fear the cold

I wish for dreamless sleep
For something that will keep all thought silent
All screams of inner fear makes control impossible
Tears me open

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

If I could I'd crown myself each day
If I could I'd let myself know I'm okay
If I could I'd throw myself into the flames

But I fear my heart, fear my soul
I fear I'm weak, I fear I'm wrong, I fear the cold
That the world is yours, that I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong and I fear the cold

",Fear,2008
Evergrey,"Was it just a phase? Was it all a lie?
Your first mistake, have I been blind?
When words mean nothing, lack value and weight
All we have is nothing, what does nothing weigh

Lost my will to see it clear
Lost my sense of clarity
I'm standing in ruins and watch us fade
All just because of a lie

I told you in confidence
And trusted you'd never sacrifice our silence
I rise from the ashes
And remains of your broken promises

Don't know if you ever were
Don't know if you ever will
Be someone I could trust
There's too much doubts to kill

So was it just a phase? Was it all a lie?
My first mistake but last being blind

I told you in confidence
And trusted you'd never sacrifice our silence
I rise from the ashes
And remains of your broken promises

'Cause I would never betray
My trust and words, no never
I rise from the ashes
And remains of your broken promises

Lost my will to see it clear
Lost my sense of clarity
I'm standing in ruins and watch us fade
And all just because of a lie

I told you in confidence
And trusted you'd never sacrifice our silence

And remains of your broken promises

'Cause I would never betray
My trust and words, no never
I rise from the ashes
And remains of your broken promises

",In Confidence,2008
Evergrey,"Been poisoned in the blood red sea
I've fallen out of reach
It's colored by the mix of tears
And the open wounds of thousands

Devoured by the strength of waves
That feels like flames of fire
Enslaved by years in nothingness
I surrender to the silence

And when I'm reaching you're just turning
Your hands are gone when I try to reach for them

Today you died for me
Today you set me free
But the scars you caused will stay
Nothing is erased, no nothing

You claim it's not your fault
You say you're not to blame
But even though you died today
Nothing is erased, no nothing

Did you really think that we would cope forever?
Maybe you never stopped to think at all
The scars that we wear were not self-inflicted
It was your words that caused our fall

Today you died for me
Today you set me free
But the scars you caused will stay
Nothing is erased, no nothing

You claim it's not your fault
You say you're not to blame
But even though you died today

You say you're not to blame
But even though you died today

What if I would say I'm different?
What if I would say I've changed?
Would it really doesn't matter?
I'm just asking for some faith

And if you'd give your heart I'd take it
To never ever break it
But the scars you caused remains
And nothing is erased

",Nothing Is Erased,2008
Evergrey,"Give me a reason why I'd follow you
One single hour when I become you

Unjust prophecies, uncalled for enemies
And all those nights of anguished sleep
Where you wish that someone heard
You've become numb to the world
But you're not alone

So have you ever felt like I feel?
Wounded and never got a chance to heal
And have you ever been through what I've been through
Still breathing?

So please hear my words
As I'm begging you to heal my wounds
Heal my wounds, I'm bleeding through
I never saw it in the eyes of you
What I felt was always true

Unjust prophecies, uncalled for enemies
And all those nights of anguished sleep
Where I wish that someone heard
I've become numb to the world
And I've become you

Have you ever felt like I feel
Wounded and never got a chance to heal
And have you ever been through what I've been through
Still breathing, still breathing?

Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

Unjust prophecies, uncalled for enemies
And all those nights of anguished sleep
Where you wish that someone heard
You've become numb to the world
But you're not alone, no you're not alone

And have you ever gone through what I've gone through
Still breathing, still breathing?

",Numb,2008
Evergrey,"My chest is open
My heart's on the ground
My bare feet soaked in my blood
As I leave you without a sound

No one to reach for
Even though I stretched too far
No sky to warm me up
As darkness clouds the blue

I'm leaving
I couldn't live with the shame
No more denying
I've stopped the search for blame

Heading for virgin soil
Set foot on sacred ground
And with no one to reach for
No, no one

Twenty seven years of falling
Twenty seven winters slave
Twenty seven years of dreaming
And this is all the strength life gave

Twenty seven summers weaker
And the autumn's just the same
Twenty seven years

And if you'd ask then I'd deny that
I didn't have the strength to fight that growing weakness
And I buried all signs to cover what I feel underneath
The hollow remains of me

My chest is open
My heart's on the ground
My bare feet soaked in my blood
As I leave you without a sound

And there will be no tomorrow
Won't see the light of day
No more pain and no sorrow
I'm free from the words that you could say

Twenty seven years of falling
Twenty seven winters slave
Twenty seven years of dreaming
And this is all the strength life gave

Twenty seven summers weaker
And the autumn's just the same
Twenty seven years

",Soaked,2008

If I sit in silence or think you're right

Your feelings of belonging
Never pretend I'm something
Even if all doors are closing

Try to shine as much as you can
Don't be a burden and they will understand
I've tried to be just as much as I could
Tried not to scream as loud as maybe I should

I'll prove to them that I am one
Enslaved by the hostile torn
'Cause their demands needs more than so

And when I'm weak and I can't run
Must prove to them that I'm strong
Considering what I've been through
Another cut, another wound

What's the point of touching it
So close you almost taste it?
What's the point of reaching for it
When all doors are closing?

And I wish I could feel it
That feeling of belonging
Instead I'm sentenced to solitude
And all doors are closing

Through endless nights of anguished sleep
With no one there to hear her screams
She's gone beyond where they can't reach
The bell of freedom sets her free

And when I'm weak and I can't run
Must prove to them that I am strong
Can't hide these scars
Can't hide these wounds

So close you almost taste it?
What's the point of reaching for it
When all doors are closing?

And I wish I could feel it
That feeling of belonging
Instead I'm sentenced to solitude
And all doors are closing

I too have fallen helplessly
Spent a thousand nights sleepless
Had every hope of light shattered before me

Preventing me to reach outside
Stopping me from leaving the black
Keeping me locked inside and all I can ask is why?

And when I'm weak and I can't run
Must prove to them that I am strong
Considering what I've been through
Another cut, another wound

What's the point of touching it
So close you could almost taste it?
What's the point of reaching for it

And what's the point to be strong enough
Gather strength to rise above
To be brave and see it through
When all you get is more distant from surface

",These Scars,2008
Evergrey,"I'm walking through fields of the fallen alone in silence
I'm praising their courage, I envy their loss
My steps leaves marks of another forsaken soul
My choices might haunt me forever until I'm gone

With so much lost in anger, too much built up fear
And all these thoughts colliding making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water making me tired and torn
If only things were different, only things were different

My soul and my inside's been colored and there is no silence
Not distant from courage I'm wearing the loss
My eyes sees the dawn of another horizon
My battle, it rages forever

With so much lost in anger, too much built up fear
And all these thoughts colliding making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water making me tired and torn
If only things were different, if only things were

Brought to me in a different shade
Shown to me so that I could relate
Lock all doors that would make me stray
And offer me a brand new day

Never claimed to be someone I'm not
And always feared to be forgotten
So led astray that I lost all worth
So torn by wounds in a world of hurt

With so much lost in anger, too much built up fear
And all these thoughts colliding making my wounds seem fatal
Pushing my head under water making me tired and torn
If only things were different, if only things were
If only things were different, if only things were

",Torn,2008
Evergrey,"It's like when kingdoms fall and you're left without a leader
It's like when dream's your all and all you dream is to see her
And everything reminds you when you were safe in slumber
And the circles you wander grows greater and bigger

So falls the winter snow, so vivid yet lifeless, out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

Just like when kingdoms fall and the world feels like the deceiver
Their words of comfort still won't reach me, can't touch me
Inside this self created shelter where no one sees, where no one hears
I allow myself to break and really reach to touch the ache

So falls the winter snow, so vivid yet lifeless, out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

Shadow casts regrets on the wall, I stand alone when my empire fall
As I complete another lap I hope I find the day when it all
Leads me to my final resting place, leaves me alone until I feel safe
Opens me up until I confide in a world where I don't collide

So falls the winter snow, so vivid yet lifeless, out of control
Dark days and all that comes with it what feels like a lifetime mourned
And how I awaited deliverance for what seemed a lifetime lost
And days turn to years

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

I'm disgraced cause in my face you spit
I caught you steppin out with another guy
And after givin you my love I deserve to know why

How long have you been doin me wrong?

You thought I'd never go?

Pack your bags and leave, get out of my sight
I won't share you with another man on any night
You tried to play me for a fool
But now you'll find that you been schooled
By the E and it's plain to see
You thought you had luck like a four-leaf clover
Your luck just ran out, homegirl, it's over
I hope you had a lot a fun
Were you lyin when you said that I was number one?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter
It makes no difference
I caught you with a smokin gun
Or so to speak, girl, you're a natural sneak
And the hand you dealt me was really weak
But that's alright, you won't see me cryin
I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin
So when I toss you out, don't dare ask why
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye

You try to make it better sayin let's hit the hay and
Make love, then I'll know that you're loyal
But I can't take the stress, don't need the turmoil
You told me that you love me but it was a lie
You know that I care but I must say goodbye
Who is it you're thinkin about when we're kissin?
And when we're all alone is it him that you're missin?
I couldn't stand the feelin that I got
When I seen another man standin in my spot
Next to you, so what you want me to do?
Forget about it act like it never happened?
Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again?
Or until you say when, you're through with me
But you will see I'll be the first one to say goodb-why-e

And maybe by now you're sick of my voice
But it's too bad cause you made me mad

And if she got a man and he tries to step up
It's ashes to ashes and dust gets swept up
Tryin to step to me, boy, you must be sick
Got a nine in my pocket, takin heads out quick
I make my music loud, my parents proud
There's not an artist alive drawing a better crowd
Than the Everlasting operator droppin a groove
To make you get up and dance while I bust this move
And talk about myself, I don't need a partner
Bilal has the cuts, then I'll help start the
Show, let a lyric flow and you'll know
I make you jump up out your seats, scream and say ""ho!""

He's my partner, not a stand-in
On a 'highway to heaven' just like Mike Landon
And when it comes to battles my boy's a sure win
He's been in more scandals than J.R. Ewing
Busted up more parties than five-o
When it comes to a fight my boy's good to go
So step on stage, we duke it out like men
I beat you down with every word that flows out my pen
And I was the Green Hornet Bilal'd be Kato
Right by my side kickin up dust
And if a sucker acts stupid, grab my gat and bust
You can't run away cause my clip holds ten rhymes
If you been beaten once, I'll beat you ten times
Worse than you ever been beaten before
I don't drop my mic unless my throat gets sore
And that don't happen because when I'm rappin

In my life, be my wife, don't turn me down
You're the best, so say yes and I will never frown
You know you got me on the edge of happiness and despair
Doesn't matter if I slip cause I know you're there
To catch my fall, all in all I'm havin a ball
Whether we're dancin and romancin or leanin on the wall
When I'm with you, girl, I could never be bored
You're so fine and you're mine yes, I thank the Lord
Every minute of the hour, all hours of the day
There's one thing I been dyin to say
I love you

You got me on the edge

We met by chance, I walked in when you were workin
I gave you a glace, advanced and caught you smirkin
At me, the E-v-e, you know the rest
I asked you for your number and began my quest
To conquer your heart, body, soul and mind
You came around and I found that you were one of my kind
So I laid the same old drag, whispered in your ear
But that didn't work and I started to fear
That you might be too much woman for Everlast to handle
In my eyes no girl could hold a candle to you
I was confused - hey yo, what's my next move?
My boys said, ""Relax E, and act real smooth""
But that approach wasn't workin and I realized
That this girl was really different
That scared me a little but it also intrigued me
I wanted to know if you were serious, not tryin to lead me
On, so I confronted you and asked you the time
You said you felt the same way for me and that you'd be mine
Forever

You got me on the edge

So there we were, a match made in heaven
I was thinkin about you girl, 24/7
Every minute, every hour, all day and night
In my bedroom or the shower or when ridin my bike
You're on my mind all the time and my rhyme's redefined
Secret letters to you and they're boldly signed
By me because I love you and I always will
And the thought of bein without you girl, makes me ill
I love you, I need ya, I'll clothe ya and feed ya
You'll never be lonely cause I'll always be there
We'll be together side by side
And when I'm out with my boys I brag about you with pride
I took a picture of you wherever I went
Took you anywhere you wanted, no matter what I spent
I have to admit girl, your lovin was def
But it tore me apart when you left
But now I realize I'm the one to blame
I took a thing like love and turned it into a game
And even though I regret it, I couldn't let it
Show cause I didn't want you to know
The pain that I was feelin deep in my heart
But now I think I'm ready to make a new start
With you

You got me on the edge

Well, we've been through a lot together
Throughout the stormy weather
The only thing I'm sure of is love lasts forever
I know my love is true and I know you love me too
There's only one thing left for you and I to do
Regain the bond that we once had
And once we accomplish that girl, we'll both be glad
I'm better off for it, you can't ignore it
The love that we feel, we both cherish and adore it
So let's stick with it through joy and through sorrow
Take it one day at a time and not worry about tomorrow

Get off the tip quick, boy, you're makin me sick
No other partner could be smarter than my man cool Nick
Understand, he's my man with the plan
We come to parties with the posse just to gain some fans
The posse is strong, the lines are long
People flockin to my shows just to hear a song
Like this, it's not a diss, it's a mouthful of bliss
Throw your hands in the air and blow me a kiss
From the crowd cause I'm proud, I say my name loud
Everlast pounds sounds like a thundering cloud
It's not rock 'n roll, it's hip-hop music
It's got a lot of soul if you learn how to use it
Well, I'm here to tell suckers go to hell
Others tried to take me down but they're the ones who fell
Ignorance was their downfall
Take it a little at a time, don't go for it all
At once cause that's stupid, it don't make sense
Just relax and move your body, don't look so tense
I'm not here to diss nobody, I'm just havin some fun
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one
So pass it on

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
With a forty in my fist breakin out my list
Of all the suckers I'm cold about to diss
There's none to match me or even catch me
Off my guard, so that they can scratch me
Off the MC all-star team
Everlast is number one, that means I reign supreme
Cause there ain't no others, listen up brothers
Just because I'm white don't mean that I'm another
Sucker on the microphone frontin and fakin
Not Mexican, Asian, black or Jamaican
Just a sensation made to be caucasian
Get ready brothers, here comes an invasion
Don't try to stop it, you got a rhyme? Drop it
You might detect that respect's my topic
I won't rush it but I'll discuss it
Go ahead and pop your shot if you think that you can bust it
But I'ma go on, I'm gonna talk some more
I guarantee you won't be bored if you get on the floor
And go for yours and say that you get it
Get up, get out your seats, get on the floor and get with it
And listen to the rhyme I like to call mine
I re-rehearsed every verse and soon you will find
Not one mistake, so don't try to break
Or talk about takin out the dope rhymes I make
Just pass em on

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
You're goin wild for my flow and style
I don't stutter, I utter words versatile
I'm entertainin with my brain and always wearin a smile
I don't front, I don't fake, I run the whole mile
You clap cause my snap is like a crocodile
Whether I'm on stage or in my domicile
I'm not fiendin, I don't smoke, I tell you I'm no joke
You're schemin for my lyrics cause you know I did dope
Don't give me no Moët, pour me a glass of rose
And I'll say 'skal' to your health and then I'll blow you away
Not Simple Simon on the ( ? ) just rhymin from Long Island
The rungs on the ladder of success I'm climbin
Fierce like a lion keepin ducks tame
Murderin two-bit MC's until none remain
Cold gettin dumb, I'm number one shinin like the sun
With a mic in my holster and I'm on the run
Gunnin down MC's and writin on the walls
I'm ready for a showdown if you got the balls
Commence, face my offense cause you're makin me tense
I make a lotta dollars but I make more sense
So pass it on

[ VERSE 4: Everlast ]
Pass it on, pass it down the line
I can throw with the best and go rhyme for rhyme
With any sucker claimin talent, thinkin that he got some
But what you do not realize is Everlast is number one
Cause Everlast is on a superior level
Go ahead and laugh, call me a devil
I won't care, yeah, my skin is fair
But I still go rhyme for rhyme anytime or -where
With you or any party or crew
And when I finished you're diminished, take a sip of my brew
And step off, clear my throat with a cough
And bust a move to show and prove that I'm hard not soft
And with my DJ Bilal my beat will be furnished
You find with my rhyme your mind will be nourished
With wisdom and knowledge, yeah, I went to college
And if you get dissed I won't apolog-
ize, cause that's a part of my rise
And I go on and on, I go to any length
Just to show that when I throw my rhymes on the strength
I like to see the crowd movin when I come on
I'm just tryin to get my message across and pass it on",Pass It On,1990

Some fights are left among brothers
Some nights are better than others
Some fights are left among brothers

You know the freaks come out at night with the drama
I'm a break it down, take it down, learn it
Roll it up, burn it, think it
Stir it up, drink it, swallow it
Follow it straight to the heart of the matter
Program the data, turn on the lights
Watch them all scatter, from the shine off the glean
Course by my team, it's the high pro glow
One for the show, two for the handgun
Three, the one you man run when it's time for the action
All the stories you told are bound to get old
When your hands ain't as fast as the words you flippin'
Word to Scott Pippin, got to be trippin'
You must have been slippin', or want the ass whippin'
It's time to start flippin'

Some nights are better than others
Break it down to the bare root essence
Some fights are left among brothers
Count your fingers then count your blessins

They say blood runs thicker than water
Mothers to sons, bullets to guns
Hard times are spreadin', just like the flu
The voodoo child don't need to be raised
I'm no kid, act wild son, you might get blazed
Like an acid hit, I rock classic shit
That can make your head bump, put some shake in your rump
This ain't Forrest Gump but I got mad rhyme
Why you shoot that gun, I'm a shoot this gift
Leave you internally perplexed like the question if
Some hit the spliff, some of y'all sniff
Some clap the hammer when they pull a four fifth
But most of y'all fry, kid let's be blunt
You tryin' to be the man, well I be on the man hunt

Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

[Chorus: x 2]
Lord, won't you please...bring my baby home
Lord won't you please bring my baby home

It go one for the treble
Two for the bass
Used to mess with this girl
Way back in the day

She was from the pj's
And she went both ways
Yeah, the girl was a freak
I used to call her monique

And before I even speak
About knockin' the boots
I say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits
So now we gettin' down to the nitty of the gritty

She brought her friend around
And damn she was pretty
Betty was twisted
She said her number was listed

They grabbed my love two fisted
Hugged it and kissed it
They say one in the hand
Is worth two in the bush

But when shove came to push
Yo, I had my own theories
World series of love
It's two on one

'Til I got caught with the smokin' gun
His wife came home
And she bursted in
Now I'm lookin' for my heart

Like I'm made from tin
The road that I travel
Ain't got yellow bricks
My old woman jinxed

That all men are pricks
And she flipped the script
She's puttin' lip to lip
And every time I think about it I just lose my grip

'cause I've been up
And I've been down
And I've been fast
And I've been slow
And I've been square
And I've been round
And I've been high
And I've been low
And I've been cool
And I've been calm
And I've been kind
And I've been crass

I held the whole world right in my palm
I tried to spread it around
But it sure went fast

Seven years sure have flown by
I got no more tears and they are left to cry

I lost the best thing I ever had

And when I was the age of four

I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A.
But now he's waiting tables cause their's rent to pay
Companies downsizing, inflation's rising
Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he been blessed
So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack
And once it hits his brain, starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet
He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street
And all of sudden he's like, Jesse James
Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool

Ends, some people will rob their mother
For the ends, rats snitch on one another
For the ends, sometimes kids get murdered

I knew this chick named Sally, she had a nice strut
Knew what I wanted, she was up in the cut
Swinging that butt, like race you out here
Only rapped the benz, and rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearing, champagne waving
Jewels around the neck, live style she's craving
Ain't no saving, she's doing enough spending
If you do the lending, she'll do the bending
Straight machine vending, it's money for take
Shopping sprees get her on her knees
And if you hit her with keys of your crib, you acting funny
Come home one day, find her counting out your money
From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo
If you're broke she'll spit, and if you're rich she might swallow

Making money on the block, kids was on they jock
They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run

And holdin' weight, goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and golds, and got no job
And then one did some kid, and one got robbed

And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands
I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands
I rock mikes and roll bikes, I cross foreign lands
I made my bones out in zones where twilight be
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three
For every emcee that wannaa test and try
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly
Make it up in gold chains what you're lackin' for brains
It's time to call your ma, duke, scoop up your remains
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed
Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin'
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door
While every rapper that's simmed is pimped like a whore
You see the talk is eighteen, three quarters past four
When your doctor slaps my ass, hear the lion roar
The record sales soared and the world got toured
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I praise the Lord
Find me breakin' up your crews, catch me singin' the blues
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King

Down, down, you go
Down, down, so low
Down, down, till you hit the floor
Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more

You go point blank range with the scope he's knockin'

The mmon's on the rise when the sun start droppin'
And y'all need to quit the bullshit that you be poppin'

And when referring to me you must respect the name
Make a quick double take and double check your game
'Cause you about to get dissed, I'm checkin' my list
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' dice
I hit four, five, six, I'm all up in your mix
I rock good from Hollywood to the city of bricks
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal
You be breakin' your vows like people worshippin' cows
And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's
Like Vinny Barbarino, Matt Pachino
I'm with my man Rino with the Brooklyn Lordz
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole
I take it back to the future from the days of old

Get trapped in the maze
See back in the days

I dreamed of rockin' on the mic
In a brand new style
Now I'm shakin' these bones
Tryin' to get these shoes
Outbidded major crews
I'm paid crazy dues
Now I'm speakin' on you
They just slept on me
And rumors start spreadin'
Just like a disease

I want to make that man bleed and wet his speed knot
He ain't got what we had, and it makes me kinda mad
I hurt my one true love, just like my dad
And it's kinda sad, 'cause now my shit's together
No need for umbrellas, I can see the stormy weather
I'm goin' outside into the rain

So I'm makin' this song, to let you know how I feel
Before keepin' it real, may keep my heart concealed
And now I'm on the side just paitently waitin'
Watchin' on you and the time for updatin'
I can't hide from the truth, I know the pudding's in the proof
So I stand convicted, like all your friends predicted
But I think you'd be surprised on how this ends, brothers
We went from lovers to friends, we'll go from friends to lovers
So if that man make you smile, I guess that I'll 
Just accept it, and respect it
I'll hit you wit' this song and let you think about it
Then I'll just leave you alone and be a man about it",The Letter,1998

I be loyal to my peeps
Like budha stud doogie

Never very bad news
Payin' crazy dues
I'm blowin' out crews
And tamin' mad shrews

Like Bill Shakespeare
The fakes will disappear
The flavor in your ear
Is strong like Everclear

Two hundred proofs
So put the match to the roof
And set this bitch on fire
Get rich, the empire's

About to strike back
If you rock the mic wack
And that's the way it is 'cause yo
It's like that

Money, money y'all
It be the root of all evil

[Sadat X] 
Money, money y'all
It makes you popular with people
I go back to the 80's
Like three times a lady

When it was pussy for free
And crack for currency
It just occurred to me
It's time for surgery

I remove MC's like tumors
The lies and the rumors
Got me thinkin' of this dub
By Timex Social Club

Yo, word to my momma
I'm high off the trauma
Whitey Ford gets deeper than subway trains
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains

All pain no gain
Makes the brain insane
Life in the fast laneT
He flakes the cash gains (for real)

[Sadat X] 
Dollar bill y'all
Dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all
It takes money

[Sadat X]
To get that fly ass ho
It takes money

[Sadat X]
To see me rock a live show
It takes money

[Sadat X]
To get that last bag of smoke
'Cause they kindly take from it when that ass was broke
Hey yo I'm about to g-off
Just like my name was Ed-o

Black kids call me whitey
Spanish kids wetto
White kids call me the king of this be	-boy thing
If it's broke then fix it

If it's wack remix it
Can't none of you MC's ever fuck with these
You be crazy on my dick
Like some porno chick

For the style that I'm blessin'
Ain't no second guessin'
Kid heed the lesson, subtraction, addition
Reward for submissionA

In to no debate
Won't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
I want the stocks and bonds
Plus the real estate

I want the iron gates
And low interest rates
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe

When times get lean
Y'all know what I mean

[Sadat X] 
Money money y'all
Some be callin' it cream

[Sadat X]
Money money y'all
Some be callin' it fame

[Sadat X] 
Money money y'all
But once I get it I'm J

I want cash and checks
I want diamond rings
I want jewels on my neck
And mad fly things

I want a stack of fat chips
So I can take long trips
I want to sail the Bahamas
On my own cruise ships

I want acres of land
I want papers in hand
I want stocks and bonds
All pros no cons

Hey if it smells funny
Then back it up honey
I want the money y'all
I need the money y'all...",Money (Dollar Bill),1998
Everlast,"Ha
In there, but for the grace of God, go I
It's cunning
I wonder what it means?

I rock a jam for love
I quit my band for love
I smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love
Make you cry like a dove, leave you standing alone
In a world so cold, watch the drama unfold
'Cause you sold your soul, now you fearing your death
Sniffin' crystal meth 'til their ain't nothin' left
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted
Your pride won't admit it, so you start to sink lower
Your Caught in a flood, and you tryin' to find Noah
If you hungry and you near me, yo, you gonna get fed
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay yo' head
Come take my bed, I'll sleep on the floor
'Cause these are the times that friends are for

[Chorus]
I see everybody out here doin' for self
And they don't give a damn on the next man
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health
I can't wait 'til you the next man

I get uptight for love
You know I'll fight for love
And I might keep my wifey up all night for love
And when the daylight comes, I be seein' mad bums
With no shoes on their feet plus nothin' to eat
I can't save the whole street, so I feel like I'm beat
And why I play the game when nothin' gonna change?
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend
I'm tryin' to keep my diem, I try to give to the poor
Tryin' to get through this life and get to that door
I'm all up in this mix for these final ticks
Going all the way to seven and it's half past six

[Chorus]

I pray to God for love
I make G hot for love
And I just might blow your freakin' car for love
I make you sing ""Hey Love"" like my man King Sun
I freak the art of noise over all you toys
Better bring you boys, summon all you crew
No matter what you do, it's coming back on you
Just like a planet orbits, let your spunge absorb it
Logical conclusion is B-boy fusion
And confusion say that he want control
Of your mentality, your body and your soul
So if you lose your hold, come and take my hand
And link up this chain, 'cause money that's the plan
I'm tryin' to get through this maze, not to win this race
We either ridin' on a horse or walkin' on our face
So come take your place on the side of love
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love

Everlast,"On behalf of Pan Am Airlines, we'd like to be the first
To welcome you to New York City. 
We'd like to thank you for flying Pan Am.
The local time is 6:45 AM and the temperature is 89 degrees

I've been up all night
On the red eye flight
The dawn's early light
Got the skyline bright
I'm in the back of a car service
My driver's kind of nervous
'Cause I'm tokin' on a blunt that's fat
You say you know where you at
I say I know where I am
And if you really want a tip
Then Mr. don't get flam
I ain't tryin' to be rude
And I ain't stressin' you gramps
But this shit right here
It be the breakfast of champs
I've been tokin' on this since thirteen years old
And when I look up at my wall I see platinum and gold
And there ain't nobody sneezin' at the money I fold
And I ain't here for your pleasin'
So put that shit on hold
Just keep your mouth shut and get me to the hotel
And turn the radio up while I finish this L

Welcome back to the Five Seasons Mr. Ford, your usual room
Is ready and waiting. Let me take your luggage. 
If you need anything while
You're staying, just let me know.
Good lookin' out
That's for you.

I hop out my car
Step into the lobby
Everybody's on the floor (get down)
It's a motherfuckin' robbery
The shit's in progress
I can feel the stress
I wanna silently to God how I get in this mess
They tell me to freeze and get down on my knees
Between my jewels and my cash
I'm holdin' thirty five G's
They told me to run it
So I got bold and I front it
And like Slick Rick said
I know I shouldn't have done it
'Cause now they standin' over me
Watchin' me bleed
Damn, I got to quit smokin' all this weed
There's a pain in my chest
But yo, I must be blessed
Because before I faded out I saw the EMS
The paramedics
They greet me with some anesthetics
They killin' my pain
They screamin' my name
Tryin' to keep me in the conscious world
I'm thinkin' about my mom
My sister and my girl
I'm prayin' to God
Don't let this go too far
As they rush me into the St. Luke's O.R.
They pull the bullets out my chest
And give 'em back in a jar
Now I'm wearin' this scar
'Cause I tried to play hard

Mr. Ford, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What are you talkin' about?
It would appear that one of the bullets grazed your spine and damaged the cord.
So what are you tryin' to tell me?
Well, it's safe to say I don't think you'll be jumpin' around anymore.

Yo, this can't happen to me
I just can't believe it
Trapped in a wheelchair
A paraplegic
There ain't no rehab
There ain't no therapy
For the rest of my life
Somebody's gotta take care of me
And people stare at me
With pity in their eyes
And every mornin' I rise to a life of despise
And ever night I think I might never rock the mic again
'Cause my brain's fucked up on percacet and vicadin
Might as well be heroin pulsin' through my veins
Gotta kill these pains
Or blow out my brains
To free me from these chains
I'm trapped in this physical hell
To walk again I just might sell my soul
And I'm only twenty somethin' years old (years old)",Painkillers,1998
Everlast,"(It's Whitey. . . and the Likwit) repeats several times

Watch me rock these sounds from the Polo Grounds
To the Sunset Strip, I'm like an acid trip
I'm flashing back on ya, run it up on ya
Born in Hempstead L.I., raised in California
Mister entrepreneur, I rock the shot that's sure
I need a dime plus more, I sip the finely corked
I want the cash in hand, and the beats front land
And I get loco from Acapulco to Japan
Mister Whitey Ford gets terrain explored
You perpetrate that Ford, you must be out your gourd
It's time make like break nights kid, and praise the lord
Keep the faith, smoke your eighth
Continue stackin' papers all up in my safe
Commence to motivate, assume an altered state
And kill your whole wack show like I'm Edgar Alan Poe
It's the psychotic thriller, no peckerwood's iller
Than this freckled face man with the farmer's tan
If I can't bomb on you, I'm bombin' on your man

Chorus:
Some get the shit, sugar, some get the stains
Some get the muscles, baby, some get the brains
Some get the powers, love, some get the papers
Some catch the vibes and some catch the vapors
Better . . . [Praise the Lord . . . Keep, keep the faith (4x)]

I say roll to the rock, rock to the roll
Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control
Like Darrell McDaniel, a hundred g's annual
The tips get clocked baby, the bonds get stocked
My style gets rocked just like doors get knocked
With legendary status like my name's Lou Brock
And my lanzar sounds be shaking the grounds
Hunting down crews, like packs of bloodhounds
Snatching off crowns and melting 'em down
I once was lost, see but now I'm found
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
And when the saints come marchin' in . . 
(Keep the faith)
I messed the alpine white, classic rapper's delight
All these shorties pullin' tools, cause they know they can't fight
I bang my selections on worldwide connections
So get the seven digits baby, never burn your bridges

Chorus 2x",Praise the Lord,1998
Everlast,"We can go, soul for soul, over mic control
Kid you can touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his jewels
He was out to cold mock me, and play you for fools
Kid, you know the rules, must be smoking (?two for booze?)
Try to dis me on the low, got to be a psycho
That's alright though, you know you won't see me shaking
I'm out to the blow the spot on who's real and who's faking
Who's giving, who's taking, who's living, who's starving
Dis me on the mic, it's time for headstone carving
And epitaph writing, I strike you like lightning
Dissolve you like powder, so turn it up louder
Go on, pump the wattage, get the cheese, buy a cottage
I like mean streets, I like Spanish freaks
I like Korean bar-be	-que, I like old school beats

Chorus:
And I'm sick of all the shit that's dropping
And I'm tired of all the lip that's popping
And all the wack attitudes people copping
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads bobbing
(Repeat)

It go bang bang boogie, I'm sick like a loogie
I'm w(e)iser than Bud, I'm thicker than blood
I'm moldin' in time, moldin' from the divine
How could you be so bold, to think that you'll take mine
I'm Cash like Johnny, it's the highway man
And I'm walkin' this line the best way I can
With my farmer's tan and my bloodshot eyes
I ain't body no one, I ain't dropped no pies
With the mothers from the gutters
I'm 'bout to explode, and blow the spot 
For now, but the gun, he'll roll
Like artillery shells, been from heaven to hell
And I'm say a little prayer for every rapper that fell

tomorrow, still I hope I get to ending
I'm out of time, I'm out of rhyme, I'm out of reason
Seasons change and leave me out in the cold
Story's old, tale's been told by many scholar
Got fist full of dollars, and a pocket full of love
God above, if you hear me crying
Tried to sell my soul but no one's buying
Lord, strike me down now, if I'm lying
It's getting cold, it's time for dying

Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine

Let man who's free from sin
Cast the first stone and begin the violence
Let man whose words ring true
Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence
Let the one's who lose their way
Live to see just one more day in the sunshine
Let the one's who chose to stray
Recognize the price they'll pay in their lifetime

Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine

Sitting here, waiting for my roads to cross
You nailed me down and you watched me bleed
So lay my head against the earth
Plant my body like a seed
You can't always get the things you want, love
Get what you deserve and maybe what you need
So fill my hole with precious dirt, love
Turn the soil and plot the weed

Come on and watch me shine

Today, come on and watch me shine

Always stayed fly man I wished that you seen her
Said they had a scheme but nobody believed her
No real job cause she stay in the streets
Gina did nails but her love made beats
When they want to eat they just walked in the store
They took what they wanted man the illest you saw
Til one day they went up kindin' fiendin' with ice
Butter like(?) the jeans and Gina said ""The rings are nice""
Next thing you know they want to pull off a heist
Shook took a look and shot the jeweler twice
Diamonds all shinin' as they flew in the air

Spoonie's sayin' yo I gotta get these ends
And these are the two I gotta apprehend
A big boy from Hollis promised not to tell
And lead these cops on a long long trail
Spoonie saw Gina and the chick turned pale
Runnin' sayin' somethin' like she don't got bail
Butter said promise me I won't see jail
Spoonie want a watch and a brand new cell
Butter and Gina moved to Pensacola
Spoonie got a Roley and a Motorola

[Chorus] 

All I can say is about the story
Is livin' like Butter Love is not for me
Let me show you how we get the money legit
Jack B. Nimble was nimble, and he was quick
Rev. Run, D.M.C. is the 'Kings of Rock'
Rolled to the top and then we never did drop
You still here to jam me in two thousand and one
Then me and D'll take the money and run

Everlast,"Yo the rhyme excursions touch minds like brain surgeons 
Feel the lyric tear gas even on clean versions 
No profanic goddammit hard like granite to the utmost 
I'm butter on rye, always high but play the low post 
I stretch to go the distance yo my lungs are mad elastic 
I'm dope on plastic like Flex, and always keep it, classic
Expressions in the facial, I'm on rachel from Caribbean rhythms 
I hit 'em wit' a battered flow pattern then circle Saturn twice
I'm nice on ice The line slice your dome and separate rhymes from poems
My life, ain't tryin to see no Grammy or Oscar 
Best believe the styles will rub off like pastas
On people, yo check Dilated, Evidence 
The influential rock rhymes in sequential format 
You see the doormat if you acting dis-accordingly 
Something to the effect of Fat Boys in Disorderly's

I'll take you from He-Man to She-Ra 
Battle Cat to Cringer 
Medieval messenger, west coast avenger 
Take you to the street, battle me that's a fuckin' sin 
Go one round wit Madchild, you'll be suckin' wind 
Snappin' handcuffs just from deep concentration 
Then I broke out the bus, the mental hospital patient
On the weekend pass, but I still come sick 
Psychopathic, you're dealin' with a deranged lunatic 
Soon to kick ya teeth in and then go berserk 
Even Van Gogh looked at me, 
And said ""You're one piece of work"" 
So I said ""Lend me an ear"" 'cause I'm the state of the art 
First I'll feast on your brain and rip your body apart 
There's a part of your heart stuck in between my fangs 
Wrap a rope 'round your neck and you still couldn't hang 
'cause you're way off track you need realignment 
Murdering masterpieces in solitary confinement

I keep your backside open like the English Channel 
I rock the sure shot, I keep it hot like flannel 
I'll survey your panel, put my foot up in your anal 
You think it can't happen, kid 'cause I'm rappin'
Ain't no gun clappin', cut the jaw-jackin '
Let the joints get shot and see who wear this knot 
Then kick off your shoes jump off my jock
And check the new style Whitey Ford's prone to rock 
'cause once upon a time, not long ago
Before hip hop was made for the radio 
An MC show had to cold rock the masses 
Used to wear a Kangol wit the clear Gazel glasses 
So bang bang boogey, up jump the party 
Someone clapped off, and scattered everybody 
Drunk off Bacardi, high off the trauma 
It's death from above, the livest dive bomber 
In the squadron
I break formation 
I get New York love like my name's King Sun 
I T La Rock Bells till they break the dawn 
Steady puffin L's, I fight hell like Spawn 
My moves are animated, my crew's reinstated 
While you cats suspensions are up in my dimensions 
We can ease tensions or we can get rowdy 
So I'm a keep it on the love and do my duty like Howdie 

Direct your short term plan, rigidalize rhyme boards wit the hoards
I'm Satan dynasty killer reveal the cause wit the sling on down 
Venom spit regurgitate death scripts I sound 
Cylinder never python, Prevail Madchild 
Physical justice can't rush this for now 
Move faker the game time set back so don't sweat that 
God don't test that, too much infinite to get at 
Face the fields Swollen Members got the iller drills 
And if you wit the rhyme steel 
Bust the revealings in my feelings of these dealings 
I went to represent shield 
I build three phases of death,
The illusion is the sweat that you reflect 
When you feel the veil Divine Styles circum navigate nine circles of hell 
You keep on you don't stop 'cause a nigga never stay still

Everlast,"(do you ever have bad dreams? All I have is bad dreams)
I knew a man with a son
Who bought him a gun
And learned shorty just how to use it
Taught him hunting and skinning
Right from the beginning
Built himself a mighty fine killer
But shorty got picked on
Beat on and kicked on
And all his classmates want to punk him
So with tears in his eye
He catch him in a ride
And told his old man he went hunting
And he felt so free
Like his destiny
Lay somewhere out on the horizon
His heart went cold
He felt a hundred years old
And started pulling back on the trigger

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna die today
And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay
How could such a short time be so long
How could such a young life go so wrong

(what's it gonna take for you to really make it in life?)
See me
Hear me
But don't touch me
You should fear me
Lived your life dearly
'Cause I'm seriously disturbed
That's my word
Straight to my mother
Wayne, my brother
Who found another one to play sucker
'Cause I ain't the one
Who put shade in your sun
And took all your shine
Watch me get mine
Feel my love burn
Me for my sins
Watch the world turn
The saga begins
Losses and wins
Angels and sins
Dancin' on top
Ahead of the pit
Don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I can't hear a sound
I clapped a full round
I came to get down
I came to get dirty
I came to get even

[Everlast]
Once upon a time not long ago
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
and people were behaving' like they ought to: good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
and this is what he said
""Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash
robbing' old folks and making' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""keep still, boy, no need for static""
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
the kid pulled out a gun
He said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good in expectations
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left
he was running' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dad, the dope fiend shooting' dope
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""back off or honey here's dead""
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
he dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night!

And I don't care, but I can't move I don't care, but I can't move 
Laying up at the Soho, looking out of my window 
Pulling back on some indo, watch the breeze as the wind blows 
Want to get near it, close enough to hear it, close enough to fear it 
Close enough to say that I looked it in the eye, then it turned away

Everlast,"Her skin is salty sweet, she wore sandals on her feet 
Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed 
She stepped inside of me, she said don't ever lie to me 
This heart of mine can be yours 
Yea that's what she said 
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stole 
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head

Do you want to be loved for real, do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be...loved, (Yes, I want to be loved for real) 
For real, (Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 

Now, I'm down by the river, taking off my shoes 
Jump in the water, wash away these blues 
Now out into the ocean, the current takes hold 
Words already been spoken, tales already been told 
Heart's already been broken, wounds already been healed 
Do you wannabe loved, do you want to 
Do you wannabe love for real. 

[Chorus (2x)] 
Her eyes were hazel brown, she laughed the sweetest sound 
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke 
She help to ease my pain, she stayed through pouring rain 
And I gave her all that she could take till she broke 
She fit me like a glove, she taught me how to love

You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
For all of those, who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunning
And keep them shook crews running, like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathing
Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothing really, hey, yo dun spark the Phillie
So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
Why they still alive I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God in a tight situation
Now, take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Son, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look

There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
Yo it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguarding my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play, I don't got time
For your petty thinking mind, son I'm bigger than those
Claiming that you pack heat but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
No time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts
Front if you want kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sipping, E&J got my mind flipping
I'm bugging, digging my ways out of holes by hustling
Get that loot kid, you know my function
Cause long as I'm alive I'mma live illegal
And once I get on I'mma put on all my people
React mix to lyrics like Macs I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleeping cause I'm creeping

I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def and it went this way
I took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed over me
Took me inside of his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
(???) cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
Then takin' autographs, and here's the laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see,

And you sucker MC's is who I please
Take that and move back catch a heart attack

Rockin' to the rhythm, writing graph's on the trains
Go uptown and come down to the ground

You five dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
You's a sucker MC, and you're my fan

And written right on the side is 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' step aside
There ain't enough room you all in my ride
It's first comin', a first serve basis
Coolin' out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight

Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife
You're walkin' 'ound town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin' on the ave, chillin' with the crew

I had a chance to make her mine but I was too blind to see
And now I got to let her go and pray she comes back to me

I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again

I'm gon' find me a woman that's young
I'm gon' find me a woman that's pretty
I'm gon' find me a woman that swears I'm the one
And I'm a try not to treat her shitty

Girl I been drinkin' ever since you've been gone
And I been thinkin' maybe that I was wrong
You been holdin' out for way too long
I get this feeling you don't want to belong

I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again

I'm gon' find me a woman that's tough
I'm gon' find me a woman that's loyal
I'm gon' find me a woman that say she got enough
And that's one I'm gonna spoilt

Well I've been waitin' such a very long time
My heart's gon' break girl if I don't make you mine
What's past is past, what's done I cannot rewind
All said and done girl, so you're one of a kind

She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend

In a gangsta lean she were revvin' the throttle
Got a sticker on the bumper say she like techano
She looked like Selena, the truth couldn't be plainer
She like a gangsta boogie, her mama calls her cookie

My friends call her a sad girl cause her man went away
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea

Sad girl living on the east side of the city
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

I seen her at the market she was pushing a stroller
Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder
She looked like an angel, she talked like the devil
She looked like a stranger, she lived like a rebel

And buy my baby food to put down his throat

She couldn't send no money but she made him a sweater
She's talking on the pay phone and something upset her

It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn
I can see I got a good foundation, deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul

Yo, first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island
Born American, ancestry from Ireland
You ain't knowin' me, you better stop smilin'
Ain't nothin' funny once my dummies start whilin'
You talkin' loud now all a sudden it's silent
Your premenitions say it's about to get violent
You want permission just to blink your own eyelid
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win
No stick moves, ain't no cap peeling
Where I come from real men don't catch feelings
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin'
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling
Mass appealin', done it since the 80's
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies
Spend money like crazy, ain't got no babies
If I don't make it in Heaven I'll run shit in Hades

Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's in my soul, soul music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, soul music
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul

Beats are bone crushin', one deep I'm bum rushin'
Guns they get stuck in, someone starts buckin'
The jewels that I'm truckin' got pimps upchuckin'

I represent the colors that never run
God bless DMC, God bless Reverend Run
R.I.P. for the JMJ
Tell BIG and Scott LaRock that we all say hey
Be like 2Pac or be like Kid N Play
Do you want to burn out or just fade away
And I can rock the mic without no delay
With my head to the ground everytime I pray
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away
Cause this type of shit happens everyday

This kind of lonely is making me weary
I'm so lonesome I could die

Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine
Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine
But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway

Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty
This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die

Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call
Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all
Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before

Why is it such a challenge to find the right girl?

Let's stop the lies, the dead can't rise, silence every mother's cries
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor

Yo it's like resident evil, the emperor's people don't give a mad fuck about your life
They'll fuck your wife and your kids
They've got people doing bids for being slaves to the dope that they supplying
Still they keep lying and tell you that it's some cartel
While they waiting on the heaven they're creating the hell
They rape the constitution while you wait in your cell
And for the victors go the spoils and that's oil wells
Call Orson Welles cause the worlds at war
And the front line is just outside your front door
Fuck the New York Times, Fuck CNN
And politicians that pretend to be the working mans' friend

Yo the emperor's a liar, the fields are on fire
Oil prices get higher, times about to expire
Hurricane Katrina and Asian tsunamis

Final days are coming, get ready for trial
Americans they live in fifty states of denial
Have a coke and a smile, or some crack in a vile
You can even buy a pill to keep you hard for a while for these girls gone wild

It's the only paper I could find

Tell everyone I'm doing fine

I miss my wife and my baby girl

Pray for me, pray for my soul Ma
Pray for me and all my sins

I'll be back when it finally ends

I hope my Government can say the same thing

I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life,
I'm under pressure but the time is right,
For me to look inside of myself, the time passes by every night,
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith does surprise,
And my neighbours are looking at me with hate in their eyes,
Quad and tea, the streets filled with death and lies,
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise,
So when day comes pray so a miracle will keep it protected,
Some of us gotta go but you know it you expect it,
I gotta believe, in more than I see,in something better than this, whatever it is,
I need a quate before my feeling is gone,
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But ill embrace it like a beautiful song,
I feel something strong coming along,
I cant explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone.

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred,
The feeling is saw like I'm getting a message from god,
Believin' in cause, no one believes in the laws,
The reason the strong breaks - a soul is lost,
I'm searching for my soul in a myst of boldest insanity,
I'd vanity my home is a warzone calamity, randomly,
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life,
I'd give in a minute the Vicapri is from stripe,
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us,
When the day comes and we rise the high of our faith,
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers,
Now the bees inside of my head, the life that I lead,
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread,
I blade so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?

Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.

I gotta new thought in my mind, in a matter of time,
Ill be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind,
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside,
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie,
If the celebration continues Ill follow my heart,
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart.
Its fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise.
So I'ma have to make a difference to remember I tried,
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night,
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet,
No words need to be said as my patters begun, cause
Nothing can break the chain of a father and son,
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies,
Tryin' to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties,
Rollin in a club god damn these people are young,
But needs to be done so Ill reach you over the hoe.

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(Wears the crown)
Everybody kicks you when you're down
(When you're down)
Laugh for now; later you can frown
(You can frown)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(Wears the crown)

With a sweet disposition
And an iron will
A couple nice cars
And a house on a hill
my back account's full
But my soul is still empty and cold
All the money and the clothes
And the sold out shows
Don't mean a damn thing when nobody knows you
And your home is just a house
When you're sitting there alone and you're old

I heard love is a game
I heard love is a rock
And I heard love is a house on a dead end block
But the ending keeps changing every time that the story gets told

Some pray for money
Some pray for rain
And some are just praying for relief from the pain
But some of us will buy
Just about anything we can be sold

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(Wears the crown)
Everybody kicks you when you're down
(When you're down)
Laugh for now; later you can frown
(You can frown)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(Wears the crown)

I'm a mean old dog
Got a big old gun
I'm a proud new papa
I'm an only son
I'm a beggar
I'm a thief
I'm a liar and a cheater too

I've been around the block
I've been around the sun
I've been up
I've been down
I've been over and done
I've seen the bottom of the pile
And the mountain top
Either will do

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(Wears the crown)
Everybody kicks you when you're down
(When you're down)
Laugh for now; later you can frown
(You can frown)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Everlast,"[Chorus]
Ridin' round town, got a pocket full of dough
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know
I take it just as fast and as far as it'll go
Ridin' round town, got a pocket full of dough
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know

Aiyyo it's hard knock livin' doin' hard luck time
Tryin' to make a dime still my only crime
A man died tryin' to circumcise my shine
Buck your gun kiddo, and I'll buck mine!
Cash walk the line, police are the swine
But knowledge is refined by the wise and divine
And I can break it down for the dumb and the blind
Unnatural acts, to actual facts
Like cats that move packs don't never pay tax
You ain't lie, boy you need to relax
You leave a five like a junkie leaves tracks
A habit needs a home like a monkey needs backs

Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'
The whiskey in the flask and a head full of blow
You got heaven up above, got hell down below
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know

I need a hard-headed woman for a cold-hearted man
Never seen it comin', that's just part of the plan
Work the hidden hand, walk forbidden land
Do the best I can once shit hits the fan
An hour's worth of sand, supply and demand
Get high as you can, the power of a grand
Two in the bush is worth one in the hand
Could cower in the van, or burst into battle
Back in the saddle, the kid don't rattle
Don't play me, up the creek with no paddle
We don't snitch while you bitches just tattle
Poppin' off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle

Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of
I get high as I can fly then I cry like a dove
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of

[Chorus]",Even God Don't Know,2011
Everlast,"They say everything's fine, down where the red light shine
Once the junkies have all gone to bed
And once the sun rises, you run out of surprises
And the drugs they sold have cleared from your head
Tight ass nubbin, push come to shovin
Throw so money on the table cover last night's lovin
Got the soul of a whore, got the heart of a lonely man
If I ain't fuckin things up, I do the very best that I can
Just like a lamb to the slaughter, a horse to the water
I only wanna drink if I know I shouldn't oughta
I'm a scared little boy, and I'm really one hell of a man
And I'm a junkie for the lovin touch of a stranger's hand
They say everything's love up in the heavens above
But here on Earth you must atone for your sins
Ain't no room for budgin once the law starts judgin
He's just countin up losses and wins
That's how you play the game, but still all the same
They say it's only cheatin if you get caught
So you runnin wild sinnin, you're smilin and yo' grinnin
With all that trick knowledge you bought
You got the mind of a leper, and the soul of a tortured king
And it's all breakin down and that's the truly unfortunate thing
While you're fightin for survival, I'm feelin sacrificial
Got a brand new rifle girl it's government issue
Got a heart full of stone, got an eye that's about to take aim
And every fuckin person up on Twitter is gonna speak my name
'Cause they all gone stupid, they all got lazy
They worship all the money and they idolize the crazy
Everybody wants to go to heaven but everyone's afraid to die
And what if God is real but religion's all just one big lie?

And this type of ish happens eve-ry-day
Type love I feel, is so for real
So gen-uine, and so sublime

Standin over me, I smell potpourri
Take you any place that you wanna go with me

In a bottle of booze, you manifest your blues
Put on your face and hit the town
Now that skin-tight dress maybe might impress
The kind of man that you might not like
First time up with no luck and confusion
Got you gamblin' with just one strike
You need more than conversation and introduction calls
You need someone to catch you when you fall
And fly like an eagle when you fine
Cause you on my mind

Her temper's mean, her will is strong

A love so true, it's so hard to keep
Her center's sweet, her beauty's rare
When we walk down the street people stop and stare
She's so damn smart, she's one of a kind

Lost a leg, killed a man
in mortal combat, hand to hand
Saw men killed, watched men die

And our spirits are old 
Now we're just angry and we act like we're old 
We can't even talk it out without one of us walking away

The world, it seemed new

Knew how it hurts 
Knew how it feels 
Knew it how aches 
Cos the heart never heals 
We're so busy screaming that we don't hear the words that we say 
Taking out lumps 
Took a few blows 
Hit a few bumps

Hope is a dream 
Hope is a drug 
Maybe hope's a vaccine

I curse the lord 
Offer them everything I can afford

Kicked all of my highs

She told me that she'd always be thinkin' of me 
She said she wanted me to know that she really did love me 
She said she never put no one else above me 
Except her monkey, she's like a junkie, just like a junkie, 
Just like a junkie 

It was April 25th, it's up around 80 
Found a spot out in the park where the grass is shady 
She said her mom's from Jamaica, her father's from Haiti 
She's such a pretty lady, she's such a lady 

She smelled like flowers, she tastes like toffee 
She kissed me slowly, she held me softly 
Got too close and she backed up off me 
Left me stoned cold sober, just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee, just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee",Black Coffee [Acoustic],2012
Everlast,"We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange
He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes
""Get a job you fucking slob,"" is all he replies
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues

Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love
He said, ""don't worry about a thing, baby doll I'm the man you've been dreaming of.""
But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
And she swear, ""god damn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose

Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like

I've seen a rich man beg I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the downside of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon drank from the golden cup
And smoked the finest green
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start

I knew this kid named Max who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
You know it comes that way at least that's what they say when you play the game
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose

Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like to have to lose",What It's Like [Acoustic],2012

When you cry cause it hurts
It doesn't mean that you're not heard
Because aloud in heaven angels cry with you (oh)

And the signs and lights that don't reveal
The true beginning of the end
You can make a line from here to mars
Of those with broken dreams and scars
There will never be a fix outside a Savior

It doesn't mean that you're not heard
Because aloud in heaven angels cry with you (yeah oh)

who can say they haven't know of
Hate or desire to retaliate
There must be someone someone we can blame
Oh but its hard to put the anger down
And hear from God without a sound
And find a place to heal the unforgiveness

And there's no one left to tell

I'm not gonna wait around
Let you ruin my whole life down
So you can watch me fade away

You try to fit, fit me in your perfect box
You let me slip between the cracks
Now I'm faded...

...Into someone else
Made me someone I don't wanna be
Yeah I'm faded, my true colour's gone
Like a picture nobody sees
Now I've faded, like I never was
Till I don't even know myself
Yeah I'm faded, into what you want
But I'm not taking it too well

Faded, hated
Slipping away as I disappear in the dark
Faded, hated
So far away from who I was at the start",Faded,2007
Everlife,"Verse one
I'm better off
Just pretending
Like I never really knew you
I gotta stop
Holding hands with
The memory I'm feeling
I gotta say
Something's different bout the way
I see you lately
You feel the same
I can see it in your eyes nothing is changing
The blame won't fall
On either side

Can you feel it breaking
Into pieces underneath
Someone's gotta say it
It might as well be me
Goodbye
It wasn't right this time
Goodbye

Verse 2
We should've known
There was always something that we were missing
Letting go of this
Even though it's hard I know it's the best thing
Good intentions fall
There's nowhere to hide

Can you feel it breaking
Into pieces underneath
Someone's gotta say it
It might as well be me

I'm still waiting for you to be who you have promised
Waiting, I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting for you to show you love me

We laughed, we talked, we played together
But the time spent in between
Was way too long
Why am I so amazed

As you've always been

It's hard to believe you have to prove it

So you ask where this is leading me
Only I don't have an answer yet

Seeing things black and white is for the weak
I'm strong enough for shades of grey
While searching for the perfect compromise
I am driven to despair

So my thoughts are spinning around
For I know my problem well
And I wonder, will I ever get
Out of this carousel

You are trying in vain
To reach me with your hands
But all that I can say
Is I hope you understand

So I am caught between the chairs again
While everybody else does fine

It's just my nature to move back and forth
Always trying not to offend
I cannot decide whether to refuse
Or to reach out for your helping hand

So my thoughts are spinning around
For I know my problem well
And I wonder, will I ever get
Out of this carousel

You are trying in vain
To reach me with your hands
But all that I can say
Is I hope you understand

Meanwhile I'm trying to make up my mind
Feeling like I'm paralysed
What's the sense of it all, is it...

Because of you and I
Because of fear
Or just because of all
That I wish to have near
It's about really stupid things
But they keep growing until
They seem to tear me apart

So my thoughts are spinning around
For I know my problem well
And I wonder, will I ever get
Out of this carousel

You are trying in vain
To reach me with your hands
You ask for explanations
Until things make sense
Well, I don't have any
So all that I can say is
I hope you understand

It is because you and I
Because of fear
Because of all
That I wish to have near

It's about really stupid things
Of no major size
But they keep on growing
Until a part of me dies

Everon,"Here in this night
In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near

It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and dread
Tells of the anger and hate
That arose from the fear

Who said life's easy
Who said life's fair
Who said good luck will be with those who dare

To follow their heart, and not follow their fear
And if the good all die young
Then who are all those still here

Take a look around you
See what you've got
You just see what you don't have
And of that you still have a lot

The sky is the limit
The sky's not enough
The tough keep going
Not only when the going gets rough

It seems we all
Don't worry much
About what is happening
Left and right of us

But even if I try my hardest
Not to care
One question remains
And I'd like to hear your answer

Acting on target
At robotic speed
Recklessly feeding
Your robotic needs

No minute wasted
Emotions refused
Your brain's exploited
Your heart remains unused

It seems we all...
Name your price
How much is it to buy your loyalty
I'll do so, if I can afford

Name your price
How much do you charge to show remorse
To throw your indifference overboard

Won't you once
Think just a little while about
What you will leave behind
When you decease

Won't you once
Just once be good for something
Good for someone
Good for yourself at least

Everon,"So what you're really trying to say
Is you don't want me to stand in your way
Is that all that you feel right now

My Dear, I wish that you would understand
Sometimes things just go out of hand
And some things just happen somehow

For a shred of hope you would follow the devil
For a sense of bliss you would sell all of your dreams
For a trace of love we may lose mind completely
And there is not a lot that we can do

Is there nothing that we could do...

Are we caught up in that river's flow
And for every new way that we go
Do we have to leave something behind

My Dear, it's that river that gives and that takes
So for every new turn that it makes
We lose one thing but another we find

For a shred of hope...

How many times did I wish I could just end this pain
That I could go back in time
To where it began and then start again

Well, if we could so, it would be so easy to make amends
But the river doesn't stand still
And the river just gives no second chance

Is there nothing that we could do...

Sick of going back and forth with the cheap shots all night
I sink my teeth in a little bit deeper
The red on my teeth should be enough for you

Just one more and more, it's never enough
To have me wrapped around your finger
I've got you turning blue
We can't put down our pride

When did we think that this would be easy?
We must have been out of our minds
We were holding so tight
It just slipped through our fingers but we won't let go

Holding your breath just to pass the time
Don't fill an empty space with the same conversation
I feel your words right behind your kiss
The taste of your lips should be enough

But I just want more and more, it?s never enough

Things are getting better or are they getting better?
Don't put me down, if you're staring at the ground
We're sure to fall, we're sure to fall, we're sure to fall

Every Avenue,"Home for the weekend,
Looking for a good time;
Of all the numbers you end up calling mine.
Ready or not , I think I'll give this a shot.
I should know better than to
Give her what she wants.
I picked her up and she was three-forths gone.
She passed out before we even got to talk.
All I want to know is:

Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.

Back to where we left off, baby.
'How you been and what's been new with you lately?'
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround.
You build me up just to let me down.

Down.

Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.

Just forget it, it's the same old runaround.

たちまち 私は磁石となり
吸い寄せられてく
疲れた体にはどんな薬を飲むより
ホラ不思議ね
あなたと居れたら元気になってくよ

何度癒されただろう
暖かな夢の中で
満たされてしまう心ごと
いつまでも帰るべき
場所があるといいね
ゆっくりと進む時間を
このまま大切にしてゆこう

ゆるやかな坂道も
スキップに変わるよあらためて
あなたという人の大切さに気づくよ

仲直りをしても
最後にはやっぱりココに
戻ってくるよ素直な気持ち
二人には帰るべき
場所があるからこそ
明日もまたがんばろうと

Darling you are a disease that spreads like sunshine the vultures make a
Halo while they wait for me to die your fingers crawl like flies on peeling
Flesh paralyzed you warm me in a cold sweat deadened but moving in seizures
Loving in fits of disillusional blurs don't you come near me buried above
Ground and rotting you can't take the corpse from his cold this is not a
Sickness if I beg it's an addiction throw your flowers to the fever I'm an
Abscess with a heartbeat an armspan of dirty needles and a rusted peices

Me you're useless with threaded lip my hands went numb to feel like you I
Should have known you were no angel by the way you said my name I'm running
Out of perfect moments I've grown tired of clothing the blood to whom it may
Concern you'll never keep my scars from healing you'll never leave my
Bridges burning consciousness comes and goes like the routine of three lost
Words lovers lay dead and when you're bound and gagged I defy you to define

Lost motor skills and a set cruise control.

Mainline the highway baby,

Tie off the concrete veins and set the radio to FM

Reanimated by the rush of eyes and horizon.
Nothing warms like a road flare when caution sets.

Anodyne seeps like dashed yellow lines through the withdrawn rearview addict.
Drenched to the drawn teeth in seething foam.
If you want me dead, you should have called me home.
Rumble strip as pulse prevents retreating eyes, dilate and close.

It's so fucking intoxicating,
The way they glimmer through the grain and make dysfunction such a fashion.
Jimmy Stewart suicidal sex appeal.

The alcoholic is the last true hopeless romantic.
Stumbling and smelling of stale gasoline,
Making James Dean speeches to an empty room.
Audrey left some lipstick on her cigarette in the ashtray

With a note scrawled on a napkin saying ""this is glamour"".
This is where Hollywood cues the delusion

Begging with a cardboard box

And the festive lights shine down 

And if she were a kitten
Someone would take her home 
But we've no pity for our own kind

Our eyes are blind 

Show me something more 
Than the wolf at the door 
All the begging in the cold 
To keep the wolf from the fold

Show me something more 
Than the an honest girl turned thief or wore
Under African sun or Dublin rain
Necessities remain the same

The moon rested its pale head
Cost a woman on a screen 
Who saw same things she'd never seen
And on a chair in a hospital

Show me something more 
Than the wolf at the door

What would have happened to me

Where'd you think I would be (where would I be)

Fortune found us when all around us
Half the couples we knew were disbanding

And freedom holds out a hand to me

Sat through ´Being There´ and every moment I replay.

I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, honey
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love

Cause there you stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say how I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on the map of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love

Speak all day, do I disappear?

Like I'm making a mistake

Everything But the Girl,"I was alone thinking I was just fine
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, honey
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love

Cause there you stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say how I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on the map of my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you, baby
Didn't know I was looking for love
Didn't know I was looking for love

So we built from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here, there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two-foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless, boundless, I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you

I just didn't know

I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love (I just didn't know)
Until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love (Oh, I just didn't know)

Everything But the Girl,"Imagine waking unaware
The light of heaven touched your hair
Morning struggled sun was here and gone
Born into empty air the signals changed the engines flared
There's a place you know I'm always there

ride on the early train past the wedding in the rain
They closed the opened door and the white smoke blew away
And never made a dumb mistake
To eat your orange and your cake
But never say your good luck isn't there

if I could speak with you about a hundred things I'd say
Dear friend it's true all that you say

and these days that passed through time
You closed your eyes you could see the lights of te touan shine
In the morning you were drinking again

and born into wealth and care
Imagine waking unaware and there's a place you know I never dare

if I could speak with you it sure a hundred years away
Dear friend it's true all that you say

and never made a dumb mistake
So eat your orange and your cake
But never say your good luck isn't there
Hey...never say your good luck isn't there

I want to make sure that I can manage

And I see love and disaffection
And clouds that won't pass over

And my life is just a roller coaster anyway

And I'm not coming until I feel ready
Not running out for heart's unsteady

Ending's gonna press to forget how good we feel
So I need something real now something else to fake it

You asked me to be honest
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest

And you start a new beginning
Wrap me up send me off I need luck and I need patience
On the back of life and jet lag
I'm a goddamn sight to see on the hot sand dancing faithless

Keep me from acting up
I can't bear the thought of
Anyone else I need your touch
Watch how I hit a wall you were all my eyes saw
You're so high now you're so above

I'm fresh out air and I need something real
Ending's gonna press to forget how good we feel
So I need something real now something else to fake it

I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest

I'm lost in my own crowd
This is it
That is us
Watch how I hit a wall
I'm my own fatal flaw
Higher up thought it was love

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Before hip hop was made for the radio 
An MC show had to cold rock the masses 
Used to wear a Kangol wit the clear Gazel glasses 
So bang bang boogey, up jump the party

Never drop dimes, I'd rather save expenses 
Evidence, I'm the intense, pressure makes key decisions 
This track hits like Sonny Liston for the Alchemist 
Will someone give me an award, illest vocalist 
I'll come wack when LL loses the hat 
Better yet, catch me wit Feds when Jordan grows dreds 
I own scissors for clones, kill mics and mega-phones 
Loud, be me or beat King Shamiq, and do it to the crowd 
I throw bucks under Daly like Chuck 
Always focused, Evidence yo here's a notice 
Of eviction, time to leave the premises 
This albums is incredible, less are arch-nemesis 
I feel better 'cause I spoke my peace 
Bout to cop a twine sack and smoke that piece

You couldn't even catch a line if I called you on your chip (sup?) 
In your ear, crisp and clear

A statesman, in the sun, Herut the L.A. shogun 
Show some, show many, that lyrics are plated for 
I'm here to last in the late night, more longer than Arsenio 
Defari, diamond in the rough wit hot stuff 
So many niggas claim that they focused, but that's a fuckin' bluff 
Or a lie, you can't lie to a man with a third eye 
I'm in tune wit this shit, like when the birds fly 
It's not enough to be focused just in the mind 
Like the locust, I swarm physically plus mentally 
Which means completely, I connect wit the drums

Mr. e is a top prospect, mic checks get rep, east-west connect
Come a little tighter, pull the all-nighter... --the high and the mighty--
Taste this delicious, mystic malicious
Ridiculousness, I tease like my snippets
I strip this down to the core and explore
Many more want what I have in store
For you, in this era, this mic's still a terror
My scripts consist of printed parchness
I gave the apple to eve and she ate it
Built the pyramids and the sphinx, and now you fuckin hate it
Co-create the reborn, keep this mic torn
My defense is tight like jason sehorn
On these corn on the cobs, lop for pop, now they popcorn
Plus I got a bucket of em, so stick it to em
Bring ruckus to em, slip the ducats to em
Still they gettin ruined when I bring my touch to em
Can't feel my shit no matter what I say
Though they ass out at fappy's on the bagel buffet, with no delay
Evidence is a top prospect, mic checks get rep, east-west connect
Where the light intense, dope rhymes dispense... --here go the evidence--

[evidence]
--you now tuned into evidence!--
For more than funs and guns, I'm stressed on gettin sex
Yo I take it as it comes, on most occasions
I like my heart, chimes, and organ
But this is for your heartbeats twelve in the morning
Never tense, I rock the flossy, fly shit from tchaikovsky
Don't drink so I get bent when I sip bacardi
Spark this party, no question
Never caught wearin guess, and
Seldom lose when I got my chips on the table
Go against the oz, and face the wizard
So play that evil shit then come short, get the blizzard
Why is it you be buildin worlds that's fake and useless?
Heads pretend they hard, yo their favorite movie's lukas
Now you focused like ? caught locusts
This style's covered like rakim's, I ain't no joke, this
Flow is out of control like rap in fact
Man I told em in the front, in the middle, in the back, it's like that

From l.a. this mc stallion
Only a few I know got the bomb chronic like ev'
Yo, fuck the nonsense, our likwid eastern conference
And now we do it coast to coast like the liks --the magnificent--
Defari, eon, and evidence
The present tense is dope rhymes to the infinite power
Wack mc's fight in the yard, I kill the God that towers
And shoot at will shoot to kill with lyrical skills
Like the beatnuts, pop the trunk and watch this bitches head for the hills
But in my trunk there's straight bumps like that
And just a licensed nba spalding notebook, that looks phat
With phat rhymes and there's pages and pages
This shit's outrageous, independence connect, drop this ? ? ?
For wages, blow both indoor and outdoor stages
All ages feel they root like the flute, this gets contagious

I turn checks to cash, but no cash for checks
I never paid for sex, I pay girls to leave after sex

Hybrid
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces,
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
Comin at you from every side

Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways ripe with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Fourth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spittin' rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

The man's bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams you glance over
I am visclorosous, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage

That's why I need ruby quartz glasses,
'Cause when I glance there's a chance
That I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano

I use skills when I need pleas sees the rhyme
I hear when I bleed as I proceed through time
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules

I bring the knowledge the you swallow a state that's a hologram
I botch your head, fatten your lip like collagen
The telepath deliver verses with no postage

Steals off of my torso with enemies
By any means, I've seen what it's worth
A curse, snakes and centipedes is venomous
Seems the only safe place is Venice Beach
Try to wrong my rights, try to right my wrongs
Try to write my songs
Shine lights but the night is gone
Daybreak becomes the encore
Can't tell the day to stay because I'm on tour
A young kid pumpin' De La Soul
Spit live, you could say loco
16 not a day, no flow
I grew up with nervous skaters
Some headed for greatness
Others served as waiters
Some nameless, others were stars and straps

Steel that ain't stainless

It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between

When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
Sky blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B R double-O K-lyn in the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became

Panic on my first campaign, but when the words fell to place
I was certain to reign, I hit the purple, 
Then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong

Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They on welfare, you got health care
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where
I wrote this rhyming where I first saw my vision
Buy a better living, a place to raise kids in

So I think like I rule the world
On the brink of something bigger, building schools
For boys and girls the thought of home gets me out of my bed
I said you got them tools? 
Get them shits up out of the shed, come on 

I'm like the interstate of rhyming the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit costumed out eventually money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler a rich owner, loaner
Used to pump at coffees shops had my bitch 
Who sell with me rolling up fly ass and still classy
Asking questions like, ""Why you wait on that glass?

Why you splash me?"" Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'mma teach you like how I was taught too
Hold the phone, ward two, seeing all kinds of great fossils
Colossal juice, ? the house, act fly
Got you, no need to walk backwards, fuck with the taxes 
I speak credibility, the story to másses
Yo, a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A scully good denim jean on and ?

They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life enable your seed's
So I lean on blacks and feed em the deeds
So when I die they got a foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, plus my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but ? experienced fools
And I be rhyming cool, but my philosophy's deep
Like a dear John letter, so read em and weep

And the wolf smells blood, you can feed em to me
We can meet in the street, draw heat, but what happened to peace?
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrhea, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion had the wine, made the sign of the cross
And I will live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from ""Please listen to my demo!"" to stretch limo

To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Timbo slice
Like Geena Korrano, a cyborg determinate

Catch them in the act and end up having to approach them

That I'mma let Rev kill while I chill on the rhyme

I ain't speakin' on my businesses in public when concerning deals
Steppin' on stage like it's lightbulbs or turning wheels
In spite a couple nights of a thousand I didn't kill
I still kept it peelin' out and steppin' up for Reverend Real
Messages across the board are still remaining pinned up
The opposite of dilated eyes that I begin with
Nothin' is original even under cloudy days 
Sun is still shining just rerouted and out of phase
Lately when I walk I've been trying to hold my posture straight
Hold my chin up then feel the love from across the way
California love from Diego to across the bay
All across the map to every single solitary state
All across the baggage claim, all across the gate

So welcome to the jungle where my people serve their clients
And they greet us like they meet us so it's peaceful never violent
Cuz I've been on assignment making beats around the planet
When I serve to my advantage I'ma steal it single handed
And bring it back home so they know the ship has landed

In the future better run it when I'm keeping shit one hundred
I only speak the truth so in the future ain't no fronting

Would you hit me back or see me later and tell me you forgot?
If I wasn't in that flick standing in front of the ride
Would you wanna make up if we had failed like you had thought?
Would you by my single on iTunes and pay $1.20-something?
Are you like the rest, sheep, blind leading the blind?
Would you praise me even if I didn't have a Dre co-sign?
Tell me what you want: new shoes or free tickets?

When the dawn is softly calling
To a day that's showing promise
Of a lovely summer evening
I will take you to the forest
Where the mountain meets the ocean
We will share the fine silence
Another sneaking of devotion
And there'll be no need for a dream

There is no one that can find us
There is nothing that combines
The feeling shared between us

The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed  if not it's Satan's fall

Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

He's taken his toll
And he took it on me

I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry

And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame

I pray their souls I wish to keep
To make things better
Put them back together
Hold forever in the palm of my hand.
Burning bright by candlelight
Anxious souls don't sleep at night
They stay apart to break their hearts
There's nothing left just play the part.
In her hands the prophecy
She holds up the world to see
Then into the clouds she disappears
You can't hide from your own fears.
A tender kiss turns bitterness
Look quick or you'll miss
In a blink of her evil eye
She went from gentleness to wickedness.
Now I'm a monster in the woods
I'd play with you if I could
But there is danger in strangers
I stay away for my own good.
You hide and seek is getting weak
Inside the bruise you're incomplete
With one fell swoop and into the black
Baby fall from grace
Better watch your back.

You can't change I'm inside of her
Your poison mind has gone over the line
There will be no stopping me this time.",Backbiter,1997

Evil Nine,"Born in love with a bloodline punch
And a time release that the capsule held so strange
Wore a target of a frontline punch
And a crime exceeding of absolute rage
Rode a train in a blood clot vein
Where the names of the young were hung in our face
Saw the wrong and withstand the tug
Of my fees the reason, a big mistake
Bore a likeness of those before him
Who held the title in flesh and name
Said hello and then said goodbye
And in between he would plead his case
Saw the dark and embraced the light
And he felt the crawl of his calling fate
Stuck the landing but tripped the wire
And let every weapon off in his face
Saw the looting and convoluting
Of absolution that never came
Tried polluting with contribution
And held the movement in every frame
More of the withering, unforgiving
And run to the last grand contraband
Caught the harm and then bought the farm
And that's the part where I come in

But all the cash and all the cash
And all the cash and all the cash
In the world can't pay me to

Where the eyes of men caress head, chest, toe
Saw the rug and withstand the tug
Of our absent love, well who the fuck knows
Bore a likeness of those before
Who held the title in flesh not name
Said hello and then said goodbye
And in between she would sit and wait
Saw the light but embraced the dark
As she heard the call of her crawling hate
""Fuck the landing, I'll man the weapons
And hold the barrel to my own fate""
Saw the promise and felt the presence
Of possibility, just not her's
Tried connecting with lost affection
And saw direction with lust not words
More of the withering, unforgiving
And bad to the last drop, Brooklyn birds
Fill the weapon and spin the chamber
And bend the part and are not hurt

Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2005
Evita London Cast Orchestra,"It won't be easy
You'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of
To say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true","Don't Cry For Me Argentina [From the Musical ""Evita""] [From the Musical",1983
Evocation,"I only observed when hordes of hell spread their
Wrath and made thee flee
I saw the flames beyond the horizon as dark shadows
Were falling from the sky

Make way for the unburied ones
Bow down salute your death
Make way for the unholy ones

Step aside here comes the dead

I too heard distant explosions
The major blasts spread ashes through the air
I heard the cries from non-believers
They sacrificed and left piled dead

I kneel down I'll join the sky",The Dead,2007
Evocation,"Down the aggression path we ride
Blood our blood temperature rises
Beware of the bullets we send
Late is the time for solutions
The soil under your feet
Is about to be red and nasty

Through the past we became an obscurity
By today we are the beast's you've created

Pain one secret lust emotion
Bleed it never hurts to bleed

Seek the release fight the disease static overload
Death is the future we see left empty are our thrones

So roll up your map show me where you are
Twisted little fuckers idol servants suckers
The color of evil cast shadows on thee
In the mouth of hell soon we all will be",From Menace to Mayhem,2007
Evocation,"Lowered in her fire
Reborn in her flames
We asked for much desire
Consuming down our lanes
Strong currents are killing me
Seduced between our dreams
I found her in my faith

My angel of torment
So strong the bizarre angel of torment
My angel

Built upon bizarre

Fading loss of shame
Tempting twinkling stars
Poisoned bullets made
Wrong currents are holding me
Beneath the surface of sanity

Held in scarlet our fantasy
The vast of all virginity
I sold my soul for purity
Under the surface of sanity",Angel of Torment,2008
