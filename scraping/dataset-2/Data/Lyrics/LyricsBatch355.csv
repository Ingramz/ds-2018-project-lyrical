Helene Fischer,"Hör' zu
Manchmal beneide ich mich selbst
Wenn du mich in den Armen hältst
Und ich dich atmen kann
Denn das
Was mit dir kam, ist für mich neu
Ich fühl' mich schwerelos und frei
Für mich bist du der Mann

Wär' heut' mein letzter Tag
Ich lebte ihn mit dir
So weit der Himmel reicht
Wär' auch das Glück in mir
Es gäb' keinen Grund zu weinen
Weil ich weiß, was Liebe ist
Wär' heut' mein letzter Tag
Okay
Wenn du bei mir bist

Ich glaub'
Ich war dem Glück nie auf der Spur
Denn was auch kam, ich dachte nur
Viel mehr erwart' ich nicht
Doch dann
Sah ich, wie du mir, als du kamst
Die Fesseln von den Flügeln nahmst
Schau, wie der Tag anbricht

Wär' heut' mein letzter Tag
Ich lebte ihn mit dir
So weit der Himmel reicht
Wär' auch das Glück in mir
Es gäb' keinen Grund zu weinen
Weil ich weiß, was Liebe ist
Wär' heut' mein letzter Tag
Okay
Wenn du bei mir bist

Ich nähm' den Abschied nicht so schwer
Weil ich doch angekommen wär'

Wär' heut' mein letzter Tag
Ich lebte ihn mit dir
So weit der Himmel reicht
Wär' auch das Glück in mir
Es gäb keinen Grund zu weinen
Weil ich weiß, was Liebe ist
Wär' heut' mein letzter Tag
Okay
Wenn du bei mir bist

Wenn du bei mir bist",Wär Heut Mein Letzter Tag,2011
Helene Fischer,"When the rain is blowin' in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
No, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

Though storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regrets
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love.",Make You Feel My Love,2011
Helene Fischer,"The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real Big Spender
Good looking, so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going im my mind?

So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey Big Spender
Spend a little time with me

Wouldn't you like
To have fun? Fun? Fun?
How's about a few laughs? Laughs?
I can show you a good time, good time, good time

The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real Big Spender
Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender
Spend a little time with me
Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender, Hey Big Spender
Spend (uh) a little time with me",Big Spender,2011
Helene Fischer,"Wach auf mein freund
Es ist gleich soweit
Dann geht jeder von uns beiden wieder heim in seine welt
Mach's gut
Ich weiß, jeder zahlt den preis
Für einen großen Traum, der nicht für immer hält

Frag nicht wo und wann
Du mich finden kannst
Wer sich liebt der reißt auch mauern ein
Frag nicht wo und wann
Ich hab keine angst
Denn mein Herz wird immer bei dir sein
Gib nur immer gut drauf acht
Bis zum ende jeder Nacht

Ich würde dir gern
Ganz und gar gehören
Aber alles zu riskier'n könnt' ich mir selber nie verzeihen
Der Mond wird schwach
Komm schon küss mich wach
Und im nächsten leben werd' ich bei dir sein

Frag nicht wo und wann
Du mich finden kannst

Helene Fischer,"Der Tisch gedeckt der Wein schon kalt 
Aber du bist noch nicht da 
Es ist ja nicht das erste Mal 
Du hast viel zu tun, na klar 
Doch ich will dass du weißt was es heißt 
Immer nur zu warten 
Und ich brauch' das Gefühl du bist da 
Wenn mein Herz erfriert oh yeah

Ich will immer wieder dieses Fieber spür'n 
Immer wieder mich an dich verlieren 
Will das Leben leben 
Wie ein Tanz auf dem Vulkan 
Ich will immer wieder neue Sterne sehen 
Immer wieder mit dir tanzen gehen 
Wenn die Nacht beginnt dann brauch' ich dich 
Nimm dir Zeit für mich 

Was hast du nur mit mir gemacht 
Dass ich dir soviel verzeih'

Mit dir nicht nur davon träumen 
Und ich brauch' eine Hand die mich hält 
Wenn ich einsam bin oh oh 

Ich will immer wieder dieses Fieber spüren

Helene Fischer,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory

All alone in the moonlight
I can smile happy your days (I can dream of the old days)
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The still cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me,
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me,
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun",Memory,2011
Helene Fischer,"I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me (I love it)

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be

Helene Fischer,"I pray You'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise

To the place where we'll be safe

La luce che tu hai
I pray we'll find Your light

Helene Fischer,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I'd stopped
Opening doors
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again
With my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want 
Sorry, my dear
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?

In my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2011
Helene Fischer,"Empty spaces, what are we living for
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah
The show must go on (go on, go on, go on)
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On, with the show

Helene Fischer,"Vivo per lei da quando sai
La prima volta l'ho incontrata
Non mi ricordo come ma
Mi è entrata dentro e c'è restata
Vivo per lei perché mi fa
Vibrare forte l'anima
Vivo per lei e non è un peso

Vivo per lei anch'io lo sai
E tu non esserne geloso
Lei è di tutti quelli che
Hanno un bisogno sempre acceso
Come uno stereo in camera
Di chi è da solo e adesso sa
Che è anche per lui, per questo
Io vivo per lei
E' una musa che ci invita
A sfiorarla con le dita
Attraverso un pianoforte
La morte è lontana
Io vivo per lei
Vivo per lei che spesso sa
Essere dolce e sensuale
A volte picchia in testa ma
è un pugno che non fa mai male
Vivo per lei lo so mi fa
Girare di città in città,
Soffrire un po' ma almeno io vivo

E' un dolore quando parte
Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels
Con piacere estremo cresce
Vivo per lei nel vortice
Attraverso la mia voce
Si espande e amore produce

Vivo per lei nient'altro ho
E quanti altri incontrerò
Che come me hanno scritto in viso:
Io vivo per lei

Io vivo per lei
Sopra un palco o contro ad un muro
Vivo per lei al limite
Anche in un domani duro
Vivo per lei al margine
Ogni giorno
Una conquista
La protagonista
Sarà sempre lei
Vivo per lei perché oramai
Io non ho altra via d'uscita
Perché la musica lo sai
Davvero non l'ho mai tradita
Vivo per lei perché mi dà
Pause e note in libertà
Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo
La vivo per lei

Io vivo per lei
Vivo per lei è unica
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo

Et tout tourne autour 
Je prie pour que la nuit durée ne finisse pas
Je danse pour oublier et j’embrasse le ciel
Je vais là où personne ne sommeille 
Je danse 
Je danse dans la lumière 
Sous les étoiles en plein désert

Est-ce que c´est moi?

Il suit un peu la trace que j´ai laissée
Mes bateaux jouent encore sur le bassin
Si les années sont mortes

Hélène Ségara,"È notte alta e sono sveglio
Sei sempre tu il mio chiodo fisso
Insieme a te ci stavo meglio
E più ti penso e più ti voglio
Tutto il casino fatto per averti
Per questo amore che era un frutto acerbo
E adesso che ti voglio bene, io ti perdo

Ancora, ancora, ancora
Perché io da quella sera
Non ho fatto più l’amore senza te
E non me ne frega niente, senza te
Anche se incontrassi un angelo, direi
Non mi fai volare in alto quanto lei

È notte alta e sono sveglio
E mi rivesto e mi rispoglio
Mi fa smaniare questa voglia
E prima o poi farò lo sbaglio
Di fare il pazzo e venir sottocasa
Tirare sassi alla finestra accesa
Prendere a calci la tua porta, chiusa, chiusa

Ancora, ancora, ancora

Non ho fatto più l’amore senza te
E non me ne frega niente, senza te

Join in the final battle
Come in the name of your father
Loke awaits you in the war

The waves are rising as mountains
They will murder each king and each trell
Where they drown in the sea
That is flowing over the land
The twilight of the gods has conquered the earth
Evil is saging in the flood of Jormundgands gush of waves
And sounds like the sough of a hundred winds

Now, no green can be seen
Everything lies in a sea of ashes
And all that once was beautiful
Is now in ruins
The earth is an open wound
Which slowly fades
No more years of life
Everything is black

Slain by Thors hammer
But he himself is killed
Jormundgand, the lord of the deep
The black flood of evil

Dead is the lord of the sea
Dead is the dark flood of evil
Dead is Lokes son the serpent that surrounds Midgard
Dead is the serpent that never was released before the
Final battle
Dead is Jormundgand he who enters the embracement of

He waves a stick. Keeps you sick
Push back the night.
Push back the night.

Hell Raizah,"[Hell Razah]
Yeah, yeah yo
I'm like a whirlwind spinnin wit words of wisdom
In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Raizah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a ?nor? face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud, knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord
G-G Maccabee, K-P-P rapidly
Aiyyo Prodical, niggas is charged wit blasphemy

Chorus [Hell Razah]
AND ALL THAT HARD ROCK SHIT (charged wit blasphemy)
AND IF YOU'RE FEELIN LIKE AN ENEMY (come after me)

[Killah Priest]
I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

[Trigga]
Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

[Prodigal Sun]
A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo
(Let's mark that ass nigga)

Verse 1- Hell Razah

Here's something to advertise, promote it keep the fan satisfied
Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide
Leave em paralyzed,they stolen every word i provide
Without no clearence, i nurture this track like Amish parents
Got requests from retail stores, for my appearence
First we target it, then they market it, to kill ya artist wit
The hungry shark, contra hit, whoevers starting shit
Got as many rap soldiers, for how much this record ships
Fuck them niggaz you record with,I make them forfit
Send a bomb rap fed ex into ya office, son we buil and deliver
Came to build with the Gza, 
check the chorus from the Rza, the real album spitta
Me and my street team be holding congress meetings
Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking
Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you
Its the comming of the  newest hip hop christ
Pop you, try the BDS and soundskins from war fans
Ya whole roster cant take on, one Sun of Man

Verse 2- Gza

Industrialize niggaz change soon as ya get in
Throw em on a auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid, for them wack rhymes made
It's over rated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful, and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell
I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps
Mickey mouse niggaz get caught on the trap
Ya cottonelle kids from scottsdale cleanex
Looking like rockwell wearing Vnecks
Ya learn from this earn from this
Niggaz getting tossed and turned for this, burned for this
Extort from a thousands degrees of live MCs
I melt ya niggaz down to the size of fleas

Verse 3-Timbo King

The microphonus, collect the bonus, aiyo we on this
House niggaz verse the homeless
Ten to one, Tim's the one
Royal famous,the verbal painless
The dark gallery, million dollar pictures
Import from poor to riches, leanin on doors
We move across the broklynn bridge doing 60
Illegal driving, from dusk to red dawn
The Gza/Genius, Wu-tang we live long

Verse 4- Dreddy Kruger

True indeed, I hook tracks like my seed
Persona, wack MCs do me notta

Everybody on the right hand side
I want to see why'all niggaz get live in the party tonight
All my niggaz on the left hand side, I know your high or
I know you came to the club, to not die
All my niggaz in the center, I came to enter
In the, middle of your brain cell, it's me, Hell Razah
Article one, hit the streets nigga
4th Disciple, and we got the rifle

I pull in wolves like Adolf Hitler, for my two brothers
And two sisters, I tattoo scriptures
Love my seed, like I love the Lord
I was thirteen, when I first record, now I'm back with a heavier sword
It's either rap, crack, or basketball
Young kings want to gun sling, and snatch earrings
Eighty seven, it was microphone fiend, and crack king
We used to battle on the lunch room table, before labels
Now they pay us, so the radio play you
You'se a lame nigga, and you know, we know the truth
And we back, and we back in the booth, first recoup
Then recruit, now salute, we on the loose, ain't ready to shoot
Blueberry in our Timberland boot, I'm livin' proof
Tell your A&R we burnin' his coupes
My lifestyle is danger, Hell Razah, let the name linger
Touch my throat, and I cut off ten fingers
The street's I'm from, son, everybody's steamers
Smokers and heavy drinkers, slingers and chain swingers
I'm one of those, Red Hook cats, set up a track
Bring your soul to another world, you'll never come back
It be that government that made us like that, gave me a gat
I be excuses every ghetto inside, is fallen at
Got the chick high off of contact, keep the windows up
Whoever rollin' with me in here, throw your singles up
It's loyalty over money, bitches, and keys
Backstab me, snatch his arms out the both of his sleeves
Chain and command, explained from a brain of a man
We go to war, like the Arabs'll do, from Pakistan
Matter fact, like the Sun of Man would, from Bethlehem
Drop a jewel that the children out in school, can understand

All my brothers on the right hand side
I want to make sure why'all leave out this party alive
And all my ladies on the left hand side, that got a drop and
Hold it down, cause we don't got nine lives
All my people in the center, I came to enter
In the middle of your brain cell, it's me, Hell Razah

Hell Raza & 4th Disciple,"""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Hell Razah, Get Large Productions
Revolution music, Rebel Music, baby

[Chorus]
It's Rebel Music, put your mind into it
Right hand in the air, before you solemly sware it's
(rebel music)
The next rap level to music, step your paint game up
And if not, then keep moving
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, this be the theme for the UBP's
O.G.'s, and they young seeds
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music, Rebel Music's on my side always (it's what I keep by my side)
Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always
You'll be back like young black geronimo jacks
With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""
Afro picks, black leather gloves and Cadillac's
Marvin Gaye tracks, straps like Ron O'Neal

Rest in peace, Bobby Seals, Bobby Seals
Lived to die, for revolutionary music, rest in peace
Tupac Ashata Shakur, get up, stand up
Lived to die, for revolution music
Rest in peace to all the brothers in the ghetto
Didn't make it, get up stand up, don't give up the fight
Lived to die, for revolution music
Said get up, stand up, revolution to the only black
Sun of Man, the son of god
Get up, stand up, rest in peace, to all my brothers Tard and Clint
Cousin Jason, Ghetto Government Officials, died for rebel music
Signed, sealed and delivered

KP  Killah Priest  Iron Sheek  
These times we gotta take one step.. forward. 
Put one foot in front of the other  my brother.. 
Yo  check this out  

Early natives related to throwns of David  
Captured by some patriots  and thrown on slave ships  
They stripped us naked  while they wives picked they favourite  
Lives were wasted, in the hands of the hated, 
Driven from the garden [garden], now we starvin' in the martyring Sodom, 

They call it Harlem, wordly problems got us at the bottom, 
The Earth crisis, and the righteous grab their ice picks, 
Seekers like us for our rices, I stay in ciphers, 
Our live is, connected to second son of Isaacs, which had a tight grip, 

On the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother, 
The elders who served the younger, words heard in thunder, 
Down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger, now it's cold in summer, 
To slow your slumbers, behold a number, 600, 6 and 3 score, 

The same as he saw, who ate his heat raw, in the time before, 
They climbed aboard a dinosaur, information held behind the doors, 
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here, 
Then they gave us crack and beer, in the back of the stairs, 

Please adapt your ears, add or subtract the years, and form the unwise, 
And watch the sunrise from sunset, none-slep, one flesh, one breath..

One Step, One Flesh, One Breath

One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 

Devils morale, they caught us playing with the gold marbels, 
We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle, before the devil sold me, 
To the unholy, because my father told me, 
I lived like a monks of lowly, lowly, but lowly?, 

The president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti, 
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Ufraeties, 
Maybe they send germs that polluted our sperm, 
And made us live with circumcize in the serpent eyes, 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies, 
But in the halls of Farrow the walls are narrow, 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom, 
Now free them, lets feed um', feed um'... 

They took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica, 
Promised us 40 achers and a mule, treated like an animal, 
Understand the jewel, brought to the 50 states, 
Deuteronomy 28, verse 68, it all relates, 1555 is when we first arrived, 
We tell jokes wish um' get high, and watch the fish fry...

The door is open, yeah, yeah

It's like, beware of bio chips, I share hits
Harder than slave whips like I waited to get tips
From Egypts to sea ships, to bein' chased by new york
Cops out the precincts, and words was bricks
We buildin' projects to pyramids, evil kid
I destroy your ass like London bridge, smoke trees of weed
Take off the leaves out the twigs, pure truth is what I got to give
A lot to live for, you ain't rich before poor
It ain't peace without poor, how would stand without a floor
Under, over, toxicated, sober
Younger, older you're elevated, higher than a empire state
Elevators I roll with creators and creamators
Stalkin' through this nature, the heaven raise ya
Capacity in your brains beyond the clouds of rain

See nor hear not summon as lord
Divident per segment def unseen beings
Speak no evil to all I see, tappin into the
Worlds vision with the proper rhythmic meditation
Situation on lives from state to state
Rent to pay, state debate, contract dates
Cheddar in error, slave mental death to the treasure
Washing my robe in the blood of the lamb, constant plan
Never strayin' new york cause I rock supreme forever for I can never
? blackring on the ? axe spring the ghetto compact
Put em on tracks, and let's see how they act as the aftermath
Increase accelerate the sun behind you radiate, to burn to ashes
Ain't one of the parties you been crashing
Bring the beat and I'm a slash it
My niggas make sure the doors have been barricaded
It's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ? block spin?
But make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts
Redrum mania reincarnate to another shape
Bomb flashes, what can happen, new jack-in
Your rappin' ain't the magnum so when he cought up to half these
Niggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion

Expand your mind
Seek and you shall find

Walkin through the penile glands, like it was a unfathered man
Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway
Through a long dark hallway
Use your conscious as a compass to avoid bein' conquered
By nonsense, use your subconscious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
And leave bread tracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
You might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understandin' is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatric's could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
Cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
Which is always competitive, therefore
You must never let it live

Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind, seek and you shall find
Expand your mind, seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find

So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man, True Mast', collabora-tion

[Chorus:]

Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs

[Verse One: True Master]

Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
And exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter

[Verse Two: Method Man]

Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
Or here lie, another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
To get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies
Turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, yo

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Prodigal Sunn]

I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth
I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mindstate
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?

[Verse Four: Hell Razah]

This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
? of Islam, keeps me calm
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
? , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I separate your Adam's Apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack

Ugh! What's goin on? What's goin on?
Yo, yo

Deep in the Water of life, I would fight
Wearing turbens, purified up in the virgin
Emerging the blood, would flood up the wombs
The eggs hatch, and let loose, a fume
Prophecized just like Jesus, writing Hebrew
On the wall's of my mother's fetus
Then I was swimming in the afterbirth
Each chapter, each verse, got deeper, got worse
The keeper, of laws, my brain, what saw
The seeker, of tablets, preachers, would ban it
The force, brought forth, the holiest, controlliest
Slowly, takin me, into, the mental, orgasm
Was 'jaculating, stimulating, relating to life
Incubating, rotating around light beams
Like creams, I was formed in the white dream
Redeemed, like powder, outta, my maker
Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh.. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

I was born alone, begun from blood, skin and bones
To the mind, body, soul hunter, creating poems
For immature brain cells, trapped in confusion, I ruin your mental
I sent that ass to Hell and tell the devil that I sent you
I react like a reflex, protected by God
Bringin life to the brain-dead, diggin deeper than the graveyard
The stick that you walk with, I broke a long time ago
There's nowhere to hide when I stalk like a shadow
Everyday somebody dies, somebody else is born
A chain reaction, life's a cycle like plastic
I practice, ghetto bastards I'm givin caskets
Innocent, murderous is what you don't expect
While secret Satan agents be livin off your death
I'm already a waitin victim to an unknown death trap
Hell is gettin hot, is it too late for me to sweat that?
The killah team, guillotine get chopped where your heads at
In order to get revenge ya got to pass my dead end
I use your best friend to set ya up for me to win
To put the blood inside my pen to write my next sin
Then again, the beast from within, it just possessed
It leads me to kill, then I'm left with your bloody mess
I seem insane, since semen my brain been gained
Like Monopoly, but there's no way of stoppin me

I die slow, struggled in the wounds of evil
My technicality wins a race based on reality
Everyday is still a revolutionary thrill
The war's in the streets, bodies floatin down the bloody river
Terror, livin in this present day and era
Caged in the belly of the beast, thoughts of a killah
The duty of a wise man, prophecized, civilize the savage
Yeast, I generate heat from the East
Repells revelation, livin in revelation
The Sunz of Jacob shall fill the power of the nation
Created, situated, on physical plains, originated
From drops of sperm, the black germ
I come with the scientifical techniques and masses
The methods of madness, psycho wrath of gases
Burnin through flesh, deteariatin brain cells
Waves radiate as I escape the channel of Hell
The arsenal, one Prodigal, Sun of Man
Stalks the fuckin land with evil, various plots and plans
The wicked lashes shall buries us inside time and matter
I write chapters through the raptures of disaster

Trapped in a long dark tube, fightin for exsistence
Absorbin stressful germs as I travel the distance
Eternally locked in a cell in the form of sperm
Doing life, mental strife, evil semenal germ
Swimmin through revengeful cycles, accumlatin arches
Killin of the sperm cells, illuminatin darkness
Stranglin 'em with my tail, absorbin life from semen
When I was born I came out screamin and blasphemin 
Cryin in blood, spittin at the figure of Christ on the holy ?
See, since the sonogram I was diagnosed to be cursed
Doctors administered stress, I'd be born in the church
But they sold the womb closed of unholy bitches
A burst up, reversed and blast through the stitches
Ahh! Hell at last, my first breath that I cursed
They performed the ritual, took me home in a hurse
But in the womb I metamorphesized, my birth and death was already prophecized
Instead of a crib I slept in a casket
Sacrificed the first born but Christ denied this evil bastard
For all of those who don't understand what I'm talkin about
You're trapped in my helium of evil thought, figure your way out
Or be comdemned to eternal livin death",Deep in the Water,1999
Hell Razah,"Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimentin with all types of fuckin gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid
Atoms Shatter, and lemons start to scatter
Illusion dwellin in path for mental confusion",Elements (Writing Rhymes With a Liquid Pen),1999

All my niggaz in the center, I came to enter
In the, middle of your brain cell, it's me, Hell Razah
Article one, hit the streets nigga
4th Disciple, and we got the rifle

I pull in wolves like Adolf Hitler, for my two brothers
And two sisters, I tattoo scriptures
Love my seed, like I love the Lord
I was thirteen, when I first record, now I'm back with a heavier sword
It's either rap, crack, or basketball
Young kings want to gun sling, and snatch earrings
Eighty seven, it was microphone fiend, and crack king
We used to battle on the lunch room table, before labels
Now they pay us, so the radio play you
You'se a lame nigga, and you know, we know the truth
And we back, and we back in the booth, first recoup
Then recruit, now salute, we on the loose, ain't ready to shoot
Blueberry in our Timberland boot, I'm livin' proof
Tell your A&R we burnin' his coupes
My lifestyle is danger, Hell Razah, let the name linger
Touch my throat, and I cut off ten fingers
The street's I'm from, son, everybody's steamers
Smokers and heavy drinkers, slingers and chain swingers
I'm one of those, Red Hook cats, set up a track
Bring your soul to another world, you'll never come back
It be that government that made us like that, gave me a gat
I be excuses every ghetto inside, is fallen at
Got the chick high off of contact, keep the windows up
Whoever rollin' with me in here, throw your singles up
It's loyalty over money, bitches, and keys
Backstab me, snatch his arms out the both of his sleeves
Chain and command, explained from a brain of a man
We go to war, like the Arabs'll do, from Pakistan
Matter fact, like the Sun of Man would, from Bethlehem
Drop a jewel that the children out in school, can understand

All my brothers on the right hand side
I want to make sure why'all leave out this party alive
And all my ladies on the left hand side, that got a drop and
Hold it down, cause we don't got nine lives

Hell Razah, Get Large Productions
Revolution music, Rebel Music, baby

[Chorus]
It's Rebel Music, put your mind into it
Right hand in the air, before you solemly sware it's

The next rap level to music, step your paint game up
And if not, then keep moving
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, this be the theme for the UBP's
O.G.'s, and they young seeds
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music, Rebel Music's on my side always (it's what I keep by my side)
Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always
You'll be back like young black geronimo jacks
With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""
Afro picks, black leather gloves and Cadillac's
Marvin Gaye tracks, straps like Ron O'Neal

Rest in peace, Bobby Seals, Bobby Seals
Lived to die, for revolutionary music, rest in peace
Tupac Ashata Shakur, get up, stand up
Lived to die, for revolution music
Rest in peace to all the brothers in the ghetto
Didn't make it, get up stand up, don't give up the fight
Lived to die, for revolution music
Said get up, stand up, revolution to the only black
Sun of Man, the son of god
Get up, stand up, rest in peace, to all my brothers Tard and Clint
Cousin Jason, Ghetto Government Officials, died for rebel music

Leave him there, never know, get him off me

Bought a lot of clothes and, played the ave
Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes
And if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash
I ain't tryin to waste my career on y'all
Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all
But if I gotta go out, you know I'mma show out
You gon' fuck around and get your whole back blown out
I remember on the Island, can't tone out
The mess hall crawler, about to zone out
Dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
We just dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out

See me

Make the Post, front page and, center-Stagin'
When it's time to bust off them things, it ain't a game man
We rocked out own diamond rings, see them 'Bling, Bling'
Got big boy toys, push Sixes
Dime bitches, told y'all before we import those
Jury stay froze, court cases get closed
Niggas hate Nino cuz how fast I rose up
Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em

Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows

And I came from the block, was flawless with ex-cons
And we aimin' them glocks, of course, ready to bomb

Now I done seen a custy cop four pies of the same gear
I also seen a nigga cop four rides in the same year

Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught in my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me
So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen

Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it
This is the Matrix, I take it we live in

S***, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'
Shoot s***, s*** is poppin'

Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready whoa!

This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dip Set confusing
Tecs we moving, catch up, y'all losing
Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope

Come on baby this laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

I will not sleep until my pencils lie in a straight line

It's late, and I'm too tired to cry

I pray to God twice in the evenings
And check the stove four times each day
I spin around the door to make sure that it's locked
And wear these lucky socks until they fade away
The house might burn down
And it's all my fault if that puddle doesn't get me wet
If I get home before the rain, you're mine
But I won't bet

On cracks and close my eyes

You're too sweet to be just mine alone
And I try to stay humble over the fact that
Sometime when the time is right you will pass my door
The crescendo comes and'
 And 'God only knows' and you have the same sad similarity
That every time it's over I want to press play again
But the only difference appears to be 
I can force it on one of you and on the other I can't",I Wonder Who Is Like This One,2008

I want to convey

I'll buy a nice suit 
And you can wear a pretty dress
You will watch me dance 
And realize I am the best 

[Chorus]
Will you go to prom with me 
(And dance [x6])

Slow dance 
And fast dance
And clap out hands (clap, clap, clap)

My moves will be so hot 
You'll have to stand under the fan

This dance will be better 
Then your favorite ice cream
I cut like a knife
And dance like a dream

[Chorus x2]

Let's go to prom 
Ahhh let's go to prom
Let's go to the prom 
Let's go to the prom

Running down your neck

Throw mud at your back

And the fifth into the sea of ignorance

For this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease my friend

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He is sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He is playing you out with delight

A silly bum with seven stars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be""

See the drunk man, try to ask him why

Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one

Shout at the world don't care what they say
'cause your life is now, here and today
Luck is there, everywhere
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way

Be my guide help me through!
In the night I call your name
You're the light in times of shame!

All my love I bring for you!

I always try to make things better
Everything that has gone wrong
Mighty plans in the right direction
But very little has been done
Everyday when I try to get forward
I find myself another mile back
Help me fighting!
Help me breathing!
Why am I falling down instead?

Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!

In the night
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you

Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find
The freedom we search
'Cause all that we need is inside!
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while
And when it gets dark
No chance will be there for a try

When I wake up early in the morning
I catch a book and jump inside
I fill my head with a million wonders
And try to fill the night with light

A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free
If I don't want to know, what's written inside me
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?

Restless minds have searched, long before
The truth will be the same, for evermore
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel
Can give you all you need, just listen still

Here is love and there is pain
It's all around, it's all the same
There's nothing new that I could tell to you

But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be

There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do

Sometimes you're wrong by some things you have done
You see fate is too strong, nothing's won
No use for a fight if you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size like a live

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire but never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire to throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet but their parents told them stop
And then it all turned out peculiar he couldn't get it up

And it's all in vain when you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown by your own
Feelings your like, disappear over night
You sip up every grin free to win

It's the rise and fall, the prize for all
That's ain't nice at all, luck is like a ball

Suddenly feelings learn to die

Used up sympathy no chance to return
To a world one know but would's that will burn

Still aware of what else has gone
Agonized and hypnotized

We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been

With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail

[Chorus]
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally

And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind so do as divined

Put on your armor ragged after fights
Hold up your sword you're leaving the light
Make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They'll watch your way so be cautious, quiet and hark

You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling 'round but your eyes don't agree
Will of the wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse without takin' their wrath

Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that satan who won't let us be, kill

You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarfs of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hands
You're suffering pain only steel can stand

Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust heat and sway

You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil payed with Lucifer's gold

Throw the first key into the sea of hate

Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belongs into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance


Disease disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

Disease disease, disease my friend
For this whole world's in devil's hand
Disease disease, disease my friend
Throw the key or you may die

On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He is sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He is playing you out with delight

Man who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven stars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key

An earthquake squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away

You're the keeper of the seven keys
You locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes the tyrant is dead, he is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light

Then speak the words

It hurts, it hurts, yes it hurts

I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease

That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be

'Cause it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test

Lays a boy, he's sleeping still
And the time's creeping by
'Til the world prepares to die

Will arise what ended last
And the boy will awake
Give his dream a little brake

As the old has died the new arises
And a child will

Covered with eternity
Beats a heart with no fame

When my time has run out
I will hear it very loud
Telling tales I once knew
But forgot by losing you

And the story now goes on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises

Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in heaven
Or is it hell

I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me, yeah

I am the one, doom 's in my hands
Now make your choice,
Redeemed or enslaved

I'll show you passion and glory?
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man

Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind's
Deliverance and peace of mind

But watch out, beware 
Listen, take care

In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise
Ah it's Halloween
Ah it's Halloween 
Ah it's Halloween 
Ah it's Halloween
Oh yeah, it's Halloween 
Yeah it's Halloween 
Yeah it's Halloween

Helloween,"I'm reaching out to find a reason
To find an answer and relief
I see a world so strange and cold
I see a world of rules and thieves
The day you're born you're under pressure
Your life is well prepared my friend
They surely teach you what to think how to behave until the end

All I ever wanted is a little piece of life
In a world where I decide things on my own
All I ever needed is a little piece of hope
And then things are gonna turn the other way

I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't good enough for me
And all that I can feel is nothing but sobriety

I'm living in a world of fantasy
Reality ain't meant or made for me
All that I see is so unreal

And once you're old enough they teach you
Not to be wishful not to care
About the plan that's been already made for you by other hands
But when you fail there's no one out there
To take your hand to catch your tears
The whole construction we have built leaves no such room for blinding fears

I wonder I wonder if I can carry the weight of the world",World of Fantasy,2010

I am no stranger to pain

Don't tell me how to behave
Won't hide away I can make it for sure

Hellyeah,"You pray for quiet,
Inside your head the screams won’t silence
I remember those days
The terror past our home, the fear that’s in your bones,
It just won’t go away, no.

The strangle holds, the insulting names,
The wound up shirt around his fist, the nose to nose beer stinking breath.
Thrown down onto the floor, so battered, bruised and sore
Choke down on the truth of it, and touch it until you break your neck

Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay.
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Just be still and pray, and let the noise just fade away.

Retain to violence
Atop your heart like a secret closet,
So no one can penetrate
You just can’t stand the touch, affection weighs too much,
You push everyone away from

The reckoning! The bitter stings,
Whipped so bad I pissed myself still with a beating stub held belt
If this reminds you of home, you better know you’re not alone
Hold the gun up to my head, I'll pull the trigger on myself!

Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay.
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Just be still and pray

These are the memories. In me
You didn’t want to know! You didn’t want to know!
These are the memories we keep
We don’t want to show! We don’t want to show!
By now you need to know, (You’re not alone)

Hush is all I need, hush the misery
Hush belongs to me, like the hush inside of dreams
Hell’s where I was born! Hell’s where I was raised,
This hell is where I’m from and this hell is where I’ll stay
The hush is all I need, to hush the misery

Hellyeah,"I've been cast out, sequestered
Pushed the fuck around
Blindsided, beaten, locked up and bound
Always thought I was human but maybe I was wrong
I've been treated like an animal since the day I was born

The wounds that I wear are like the crown upon a king
So heavy they lie, with all the pain that they bring
My life is full of longing, but for what I'll never know
I've been drawn in to the fire as I reap what I sow

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces,
The more that you love me insecurity releases,
And I'll be the one that's to blame,
So I'll sell my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame
(Like a moth to a flame)

The ruler of the kingdom that ends up the pawn,
So tired of thinking of where it all went wrong,
Friendships they come and go and sometimes they end,
Wouldn't dream in a million years that this would be one of them

Faith in the life, belief to the end,
Failure's not an option, but the options exist,
I gave up my everything, I give till I bleed,
Take it all, take everything just take it from me

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces,
The more that you love me insecurity releases,
And I'll be the one that's to blame,
So I'll sell my soul to blaze

You're pushing me, I'm pushing back,
Falling down my heart attacks,
Compassion is lost,
No more hope, no more trust,
I tore it down and burnt it up,
All faith is gone

Respect, devotion
Dead
Disgust, hate
Lies

I'm not a hero, or a villain,
Not a god, I'm just a man,
Staring through the hourglass,
At the footprints in the sand,
I'm stripping off my armor,
My battles here are done,
Wave my white flag to surrender and fly into the sun

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces,
The more that you love me insecurity releases,
And I'll be the one that's to blame,

To say thank you from the pit of my soul for your caustic inspiration,
My methods may mean nothing to you as you question my dedication,
But to wear my life upon my sleeve is the source of my salvation.

Brutality,

You can choose to love or hate me,

You picked me up to knock me down,
No matter what I'm always the prey.

Let's lose our minds,
Tear the walls down and break some fucking necks.

I've fought the fight every day,
I've won a few gave some away,
But I'm still going to spill my share of blood,
This little games a little old,
A little late I've sold my soul,
A martyr but I'm not the only one,
Family don't mean shit to me,
The wind has blown away the seed,
Got a father but I've never been a son,
We live to die all for one,

Stab your spears into my side.

Say what you want,
Write what you want,
But we stand proud on this stage,
We're built to mosh,
We're built to slam,
We're built to fucking rage,
Born and bred a metal head and that's the end of this,
And if you've got a problem sorry but I don't give a shit

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.

But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.

And let that pair of golden earrings

With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi""

And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way

Shit's Heltah Skeltah, where's the Inflixter?

Ruck and Rock, taking you up a notch higher

I mean, it was cool aht first yunno
Jus yunno, rapping about nuhthing
Buht then like whut happened wuz
[B.C.C.] The people they started, yunno to talk about tings that make sense

[B.C.C.] I wuz like, ""Yo it's fuckin amazing"" right?
[B.C.C.] Real
[B.C.C.] It's real, I don even know how the shit start

Verse One: Rock, Ruck

It went down like this, one little nigga snuck through the door
Peeped the scene, sniped a few, then crept through with two more
Heads were gettin nervous, that's three now they want to break North
Too late -- five more tore the door straight the fuck off
It's on now; gettin down in the trenches
Eight soldiers gettin in mo' ass than splinters on raggedy benches
Since it's war, ain't shit sweet this Clique
disperse and then they transform to chess pieces

On fake grounds never spare clowns
Ruck and Rock be the rooks hold the square down
Are you prepared now I tear down, any opponent who similies
Styles buckwild meanwhile your ass I obliterate
Demonstrate, tactics you need practice
First of all your monkey-ass rhyme like you're backwards
I should smash kids, when they try to get beyond
limits, timid, but they could never get with Sean (say word)
Dat's word, Sean don't give a
Whatevah then they got niggaz who're snakes that slither (hisssss)
And if ya, want to come test the inflixter
I got your name number address plus your picture

This is the B.C.C., N Double D
In the Ninety-Now we lock it down

Verse Two: Ruck, Rock

Peep my words, yes my heavenly words, word
that get niggaz locked up in seventy-third
Prefer to chill, but the Sun can't do that
Due to my temperature tempted to bring it where your crew's at
You lack with the skills that it takes to make
ends meet cause it seems that your ass is weak
My occupation's, Operation, Lockdown
On your radio station whoever got the hot sound

Who wan tess y'all?
Mr. Mall-Doo, a.k.a. Rock-Ness y'all
Guard your chest y'all
Nothing can protect y'all
From Buckshot on down to the rest y'all
We runnin through your set y'all
Fuck the rest y'all, we be the best y'all
Yesh yesh y'all
I crack backs North South East and West y'all
We know fresh y'all
I did do I guess y'all
I didn't say I doesn't indeed sex I never measure
Ready to wet y'all
Place your bottom dollar bets y'all
Chest will become messed bored if you flex y'all
Nevertheless y'all
We out to save the ship before it's dead y'all
Lock it down with the full court press y'all

For the simple fact he's wack so what's the deal?
I feel you can't step to Sean
Wiggin out on bitch ass nigga's since Decepticons (Transform!)

Take my hoodie off nigga I can't see behind me
Why these guys chose to defy laws
Of the most high most guys get they shit wrapped in gauze
Place to be is on my side 
Motherfuck ya pride, lay undercover from big Ruck
If ya monkey ass want to survive

Yo and if you think that's hectic it gets worse when Rock's up in it
So somebody tell the fat lady she's up in five minutes
Shit is almost finished right after I take care of witnesses 
Roamin the primises not mindin they businesses
And bitches up in yo melon tellin you to jet
You know if you stay 
I might give you some chest pains like  cigarretes
Bet ya bottom dollar don't move or swaller
You not promised tomorrow but I promise you I'll make ya holler
Pop you coller
Bone stone's the way that I stalk in my zone 
You can roam just don't get caught

No need for intermission, I need trees in my system
Cut down through mart, then I head for brisk in park
With my P 'n' C, for some yard to spark
No need to get hyper, I see, C, Cypher
Power on the corner fucking with my niggas, every hour
I devour, niggas who wanna test me and defy me
It might be Giuliani or the illuminati
But I be, writing plans of attack in my journal
So, Ruck, Rock, Ville Sluggah remains nocturnal
Seeing through sheisty shit, shining like I'm solar
Penetrate through darkness bounce like I'm sonar

We been found less an organised ways to buckwild

Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl

One clik, stomping on the path, that's so hard
Ain't no smiling, we up against the odds like Phil Collins
Meanwhile, I still be wilding, but only smarter (what?)
Peep me the irrational and the quiet riot starter
Pardon this, I see you're not the sharpest pencil in the box
No where near a match, you get smashed by a Rock
I done seen 3 dollar bills and you faker
And you wonder why I hate ya
A snake'll get snatched by his tail, slammed on his head
Give me some panda thread (??) the cobra command the dead
Ban the red

Damn, ?? trials

Bring in his chart (the Doctor will see you now)
How you doin', let's see what we have here
My name is Dr. Killpatient
And I'm your psychosssssigmathetamasochistic

All I, seem to, think about is violence
It doesn't matter if I'm dead sober or I'm bent
It's strange, I'm not insane or at least I don't think so
Or am I?  You think so Doc, truthfully I don't know
So what do I do I go to my crew and ask for help
But they ain't no help, they go through the same shit they damn self
So I look deep into the mind of a crook
Then out of nowhere I envision two right hooks
Aw damn, again goes this shit I
Can't get out of this cycle, dish one got me whipped
From the thought of a brain bashing, Doctor stop me
Before I blow my motherfuckin' top G

See that leather sofa over there?  Yeah
Sit back with this six-pack and a spliff
That have your mind twisted while we chit-chat, I like that
I think that, we should start with the session, uh-huh
But before we begin let me ask you a few questions, uh-huh
Have you been touched the wrong way? Nah
Involved in gun play, yeah
The town let me guess acquitted like you was O.J. How you know?
Typical black life you jack knives under a sea biscuit
Get specific an stop fuckin' around wit that crack rock 
Yo I don't smoke doze
Yes you do Duke I can tell
'Cause you actin funny, like when blacks get money

Brummy jazz only married to Jawana
and instead of helping you're getting me heated like a sauna

Just trying to get into your head
Pardon the way I treat you
Tell me bout your scar, did your momma beat you, nah man
Fuck the mystery Duke tell me your history
You're pissin' me off
plus the time keep on clippin' see

[Chorus]
I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

As I think back, to the nineties
That's when life got extra grimy
Multiplied with a fleet behind me
Wasn't smart to try me, physical fam gave less than a
Which added on to eighties anger tearing through my inner
(Now we're gettin' somewhere, yeah) It's all becoming clear
I always feared I have to play the rear til I was outta here
That's when I flipped out and became a plane
That transform into a robot Rokk Da Kids was his name
(One of them Decep niggaz) Yup takin' dope clothes and then some
I bend some (did you have any legal source of income?)
I said farewell to welfare crazy long ago
They want you to work for them peanuts now
Man you need a shrink if you think I'ma go (huh)
Then any thoughts and hopes of rehabilitation
Were chilled when I lost my nigga Phil it's been downhill
Ever since, and ain't nobody helpin' me
So I came to you, the Doctor Killpatients for therapy

[Chorus]

Bust the prognosis, better yet Duke have a dosage
of prescribed poetry that people perceive as potent
I've been goin through your file and I found a conclusion
That you destined to be the best in this world of confusion
You lose when you fall victim to evil ways
I know crime pays but the rhyme slays nowadays
Take two of these and if you have a problem at all
I'm on call twenty-four hours to brawl, word is bond

This is my number, ya know what I'm sayin'
Four nine five, nevermind nevermind

Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes

Dark skinned stocky build with a big gun
Sick sons are the ones with the lump sums
Stick guns get funds make your chick come
My chick done said she like the way I toke blunts
Drink liquor write scriptures and my gold fronts
Plus the way my pants hang make her wonder how
My baggy jeans stay up baby I'm well endowed
See its ill I know you wasn't expectin that
Or figure Ruck messin with chicks make an executive trap
They get better than that she don't care who I bone
Long as I treat her right and bring my black ass home

Hey the name is Alban baby but call me what you wanna
Nowhere near ugly but some call me Rockness Monstah
I'm the heathen you was warned about by your momma
That'll never love you as much as I love my marijuana
Hang out from sundown to sun up startin a ton of drama
With thugs snake me one time they will harm ya
Still you goodie goodie chicks be all attracted to my karma
Lets be friends some other time right now I'm tryin to get behind ya
She responded she better stop listenin to momma
Love my rugged steez and my whole aura was the bomber
Asked to see my scar and taxed it 
Felt my six pack then asked
If she could drink it through my straw before I hit that

I know I got a good woman on my team
I used to have five chickens and I tricked mad cream
But the first one I met yo she was actin wack
And the second one got dissed cause she was smokin smack
But the third was a herb you could tell that she's
On some bull cause she flipped when she smelled my weed
But the fourth one heard the PJs looked mean
Got with the fifth chick because she cooked and cleaned

My question is why do nice chicks love rugged dudes
The whole thought puzzles me I'm just glad they do
They got they own loot unlike these upside down 3 or 4s
Silly rabbit tricks give up all they dough
Not I hell nah yo check my track record bravo
Don't eat coochie shorty understand I'm too macho
Daytime act like saints but they can't fool me
G the freak come out of them at night like we Whodini

That's a reason I should breeze...

[Chorus]
Iz you wit me, yo throw your hands in the air! 
All my thugs and soldiers  fuck it even players 
Whether you hate us or you show us love 
No matter what you do money  stack your gunz 'n onez 
Iz you wit me, yo throw your hands in the air! 
All my thugs and soldiers  fuck it even players 
Crooks, willies, pimps, all my sons 
No matter what you do baby, stack your gunz 'n onez 

Yo, light another, and elevate on this one my brother 
Respect mine like my baby mother 
I shine when it rain, the sky's cryin' for all the black youth 
That's dyin', I heard he went out clutchin' his iron 
And in the mist the slugs flyin', one burst 
He kissed the dirt, not knowin' he was touched at first 
Or badly hurt, it's all science, another nigga merked 
Kid snatched his purse and his work, left nuttin' 
But the shells on the turf, the situation's worse 
A lot of bitch ass niggaz is comin' out they skirts 
Cause it's real, not everyone can rhyme and get a deal 
Not everyone can shine and make a meal 
So Johnny carry nine in the steel, one in the head 
For all them fuckheads, leave that ass for dead nuff said 
Don't be mistaken, or mislead, it's all peace 
But when my baby's gotta get fed, I'm all teeth 
Bitin' down on the bullet now, bloodshed 
I cop my herb from a knotty dread, and live this life 
On the edge nigga, one time for your fuckin-ass mind 
Cause-o, can you deal? 

[Chorus]

Wu-Tang are you wit me, well throw your hands in the air! 
All my soldiers, thugs, fuck it even players 
Heads on lock down and those on the run 
No matter what you do money, stack your gunz 'n onez 

Aiyyo peep the stamina, of the main brain splattera 
In a matter of seconds I'm disrespectin' your character 
What's the matter ya niggaz ain't ready for the massacre 
I'll be slappin' y'all niggaz in the face with the caliber 
You like the voice baby? Ruck is the choice lately 
Slap a hoe and then grab a hoe just like ? ? 
My boys pay me no mind, for the shit I say lately 
Then deep down in they heart, they think that nigga Ruck is crazy 
Maybe, y'all niggaz should just chill before I fuck you up 
I can snuff a duck nigga in the face with the uppercut 
What the fuck? y'all niggaz do it the mic ruin 
Your life by screwin', your wife now cruisin' 
Affect with the motherfuckin' grimy style 
Meth-Tical, Heltah Skeltah for the Ninety-Now 
Remind me how, the way it used to be, yo you used to be 
Better than you is on the mic, but now you losing me 

[Chorus]

Son I used to be a good boy, fat cheeks, little cute kid 
Potentially rebellious yet a straight A student 
I listened to my elders til I found out they was stupid 
What they told me had me broke and bummy, time for some new shit 
Now, I hold mo' concealed Heat than Acapulco 
Ricans in Bushwick call me Rocko, el mano loco 
Got a fo'-fo' to make thugs sing like K-Ci and JoJo 
Packin' ever since Mamma Rock said gunz was a no-no 
We don't need those doe, street cats don't need gats 
Six-five, from the NBA, many niggaz be that 
So try me, like Mutumbo you can't get shit by me 
Send you to E.R. son with broke ankles like Allen Ivey, hehe 
Hold that thought for a minute 
And watch your shorty before I run up in it I admit it 
I'm like Sprite, image got you shaken, thinkin' I'm Jamaican 
But it's thirst that'll get your jewelry and dough taken 
Fuck Batman and Robin, I'm robbin with a bat man 
Chase niggaz like Chevy for makin' wack jams 
Hit hard as a dick after a lapdance, ask any Sean Price 
In Alcatraz fan, they'll tell you watch the jabbin' 

[Chorus]

Stack your gunz 'n onez, stack your gunz 'n onez 
Heltah Skeltah come soon, be prepared motherfucker 
Stack your gunz 'n onez, stack your gunz 'n onez

Ruck and Rock, taking you up a notch higher

I mean, it was cool aht first yunno
Jus yunno, rapping about nuhthing
Buht then like whut happened wuz
[B.C.C.] The people they started, yunno to talk about tings that make sense
[B.C.C.] I wuz like ""What the fuck?""
[B.C.C.] People with real shit I wuhlike ""Get the fuck outta here""
[B.C.C.] Whaddo they think they doing?
[B.C.C.] I dunno where that shit come from man.
[B.C.C.] I wuz like, ""Yo it's fuckin amazing"" right?
[B.C.C.] Real
[B.C.C.] It's real, I don even know how the shit start

Verse One: Rock, Ruck

It went down like this, one little nigga snuck through the door
Peeped the scene, sniped a few, then crept through with two more
Heads were gettin nervous, that's three now they want to break North
Too late -- five more tore the door straight the fuck off
It's on now; gettin down in the trenches
Eight soldiers gettin in mo' ass than splinters on raggedy benches
Since it's war, ain't shit sweet this Clique
disperse and then they transform to chess pieces

On fake grounds never spare clowns
Ruck and Rock be the rooks hold the square down
Are you prepared now I tear down, any opponent who similies
Styles buckwild meanwhile your ass I obliterate
Demonstrate, tactics you need practice
First of all your monkey-ass rhyme like you're backwards
I should smash kids, when they try to get beyond
limits, timid, but they could never get with Sean (say word)
Dat's word, Sean don't give a
Whatevah then they got niggaz who're snakes that slither (hisssss)
And if ya, want to come test the inflixter
I got your name number address plus your picture

Verse Two: Ruck, Rock

Peep my words, yes my heavenly words, word
that get niggaz locked up in seventy-third
Prefer to chill, but the Sun can't do that
Due to my temperature tempted to bring it where your crew's at
You lack with the skills that it takes to make
ends meet cause it seems that your ass is weak

A-yo why oh why did I need cappucino
Scar on my face but I'm not Al Pacino
(We're 3 amigos)
Sparksky and Dutch, we bring mo' drama than what?
(A prime time NBC TV show)

Heads don't know and damn sure ain't ready
Niggas walk the streets with more Boop than Betty
(Shit'll get heavy)
Back up, retreat, now surrender
My pine hits your mind mix thoughts just like a blender

Then I dish off from a shooting guard to a center
Like Rockefeller you hit rock bottom when you enter

O.G.C. rush the scene, permission for backup
Baseball bats attack like Jersey fools that act up
Punks in back stand petro, go get yo'
Pepto-Bismol before this nigga lets go

Get set, Go, which you do, crews screwed, I blew through
Two crews who claim they got funk, may be true cos they doo-doo

Everybody 'fraid, ain't nobody yapping no more
Have evidence on your clique so y'all niggas hit the floor
With that mouth murdering you got that ass in hot water
Now I just oughta send a piece to your headquarters
To take away your stripes, you fucked up tonight
You don't do right you're g'wan get dead to spite
Our click foundation stays thick through the war
I'm keeping my eye out for infiltrators at the door

It's a shame how these MC's are wannabees
Front on these and get hung up like dungarees (please)
Ease off selector Strangle wrecks ya
Plus bust asses on whoever passes through my sector

So what you gonna do when you're stuck at thirty-two
Degrees, please get off your knees and follow these
Now swallow these, buckshots from the rifle
Then I will make niggas beat it and scream like Michael

So how many corny MC g'wan try
When Strang sets shit off like the 4th of July

Nobody (why?)
Cos everybody gets bodies my brother
I smother a nigga then the Ruck bounce like rubber

Step to the stage set the microphone on fire
Your desire, they call me sire cos I'm flyer
(Live like wires), beast from the East who is he
When I roar like a grizzly they say damn he gets busy

Helyne Stewart,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Hem,"I want to tell you, I've watched the waves
That wake the sea
The lightning that wakes up the ground
And my heart has been half asleep inside of me
It wakes up when you come around

I want to tell you, I've watched the moon
That trips the tide
The shadows that trip on the tree
And I'm wearing a blindfold, a shoelace untied
I'm steady when you're next to me

I've been half asleep all of my life
Lost in the dark of some perilous night
Is that you or some beautiful light
Finally coming around

And my heart has been half asleep all of my life
It wakes up when you come around
It wakes up when you come around

",Half Asleep,
Hem,"I count the cars out on the highway
I think about you now and then
The stars are out and no one knows me
'Til I'm home again

The sun will breaks across the water
A warm reminder on the wind
The days are sweet but what I want is to be home again
To be home again and I'm home again

And the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
Let the stars keep shining but I'll never look back

The map is tearing at the corners
I can't remember where I've been
The world unfolding while the highway takes me home again
And I'm home again, and I'm home again

And the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
Let the stars keep shining but I'll never look back
'Cause I'm home again

And I'm home again, wanna be home again
Gonna go home again, gonna go home again
Wanna be home

",Home Again,
Hem,"On the oldest day
That the world has known
I will meet you in the place we share

And it's not okay
But you're not alone

I will find a way and meet you there
And all the ships are lost on the river
I'll swing a light on the safest shore

And it's not okay
But it's not too late
'Cause we're not alone anymore

",The Meeting Place,
Hem,"When the rain breaks the road
Are you holding on, are you holding on
To your last good day?
When the stone breaks the wheel
Are you holding, are you holding on
'Til the stone rolls away?

And I don't know
Is this the part where you let go
And tumbling out of a window?
Is this the part where you find out?
I'm there for you

When the sun leaves the field
Are you holding on, are you holding on
To the last sweet light?
When the flame leaves your eyes
I still see you there, I still see you there
On your darkest night

And I don't know
Is this the part where you let go
In sinking under a shadow?
Is this the part where you find out?
I'm there for you now

As your hands breaking free
I am holding on, I am holding on
As you held on to me

And I don't know
Is this the part where we let go
Tumbling out of a window?
Is this the part you're there for me?

And I don't know
Is this the part where you let go
In sinking under a shadow?
Is this the part where you find out?
I'm there for you

You find out, I'm there for you
You find out, I'm there for you

",The Part Where You Let Go,
Hem,"The time that I remember seeing nothing in the sun
A tremor in my bones at last light, something had begun
The light between the buildings didn't rise as high or strong
But slanted through the window like it did when days were long

The frost fell on the park when all the schoolboys went inside
The postman and policeman dropped their hat and clipped their stride
And wind stirs on the sidewalk and it hangs outside the door
Waiting on the summer while we lay right on the floor

But when I see over the avenues and when I know what I know
Just like the sleep when all our days are new
Below, singing asleep, I dreamt beside you
While my hand was letting go

You left a slight impression on the corner of the chair
If you were walking past it, you might never know it's there
If you were walking past it though and I was standing by
Oh, I was standing near to you as you were walking by

But when I see over the avenues and when I know what I know
Just like the sleep when all our days are new
Below, singing asleep, I dreamt beside you
While my hand was letting go
Asleep, I dreamt beside you while my hand was letting go

",While My Hand Was Letting Go,
Hem,"Leave my station where I stood
To lay for a while with you
I got shadows snapping at my tail
Who say I'm no damn good
But that's just halfway through
All that I'm good for is you

You know I play with all those strays
Prowling outside your door
It's the scraps of love you throw my way
That have got me on all fours, I think it's for you
All that I'm good for is you, all that I'm good for is you

And I'll leave it behind
To lay down with you
I'll stop running wild
Doing what I used to do

My whole wide world is out of hand
So crooked it leaves me cryin'
But your love is straight and narrow
And it's keeping me in line
This love will see me through
All that I'm good for is you
All that I'm good for is you

All I'll leave it behind
To lay down with you
I'll stop running wild
Doing what I used to do
All that I'm good for is you, is you, is you
All that I'm good for is you

Hem,"Someone's waving
Someone's counting
Someone's leaving

There's fifty dollars on this pony
Chase him down these tracks
Well, won't nobody take my business
I'll teach you how to come back

I saw one hundred miles of steel over wood
And let him go
I filled my pockets up with coal black with mud
And let him go

I'll throw my hat off when I beat you
Find it when you're gone
There's a straw and cotton around the station
I'll make myself a new one

I held a silver dollar tight inside my fist
And let you go
I've counted all the things I've lost, that point to this
And let you go

The whistle's sounding
You are leaving
I am counting

Hem,"Gonna build me a log cabin on a mountain so high
So I can see my darling as she goes passing by
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird and she warbles as she flies
But she never says cuckoo 'till the fourth day of July
Now my horses, they ain't hungry and they won't eat your hay
So I'll ride on just a little further and feed them on the way
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird and she warbles as she flies
She will cause you never no trouble and she'll tell you no lie
You can see that I have wandered by the dust that's on my feet",The Cuckoo,2001
Hem,"I am holding half an acre
Torn from the map of Michigan
And folded in this scrap of paper
Is a land I grew in

Think of every town you've lived in
Every room, you lay your head
And what is it that you remember?

Do you carry every sadness with you
Every hour your heart was broken
Every night the fear and darkness
Lay down with you

A man is walking on the highway
A woman stares out at the sea
And light is only now just breaking

So we carry every sadness with us
Every hour our heart were broken
Every night the fear and darkness
Lay down with us

But I am holding half an acre
Torn from the map of Michigan
I am carrying this scrap of paper

That can crack the darkest sky wide open
Every burden taken from me
Every night my heart unfolding

Paint the streets and the avenues
You float over everyone
In your rings and your wing-tip shoes

[Chorus]
Well I can't say I'll know you when
You come around
You look like a giant in
My hand-me-downs
Taller than anything
Riding a horsey through the town

Red bird is hanging low
House to house and tree to tree
He holds on to what he knows
So he takes a hold of me

[Chorus]

Riding a horsey through the town",Horsey,2001
Hem,"Broken moon in the sky
Enough to pull up our eyes
From the ground where we hide
From the ground where we hide

Gonna waste some time with you
And let this world go
Keep my heart idle
Gonna waste my time with you
And let this love go
A broken heart, idle

Restless stars through the trees
Enough to fall to our knees
Make no sound so no one sees
Make no sound so no one sees

Gonna waste some time with you
And let this world go
Keep my heart idle
Gonna waste my time with you
And let this love go
A restless heart, idle

Hem,"There's a lazy eye that looks at you
And sees you the same as before
When you lay beside me every night
Though now you are with me no more
I can still see the hem of your dress
And the comb as it's parting your hair
And the person I held is still there in my
Lazy eye that looks at you
And sees you the same as before",Lazy Eye,2001
