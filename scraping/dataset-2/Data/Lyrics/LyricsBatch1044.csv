Stephanie Grappelly,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",1992
Stephanie Grappelly,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,1992
Stephanie Grappelly,"Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home",Swanee River,1992
Stephanie Grappelly,"Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger!

Stephanie Grappelly,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Stephanie Grappelly,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Stephanie Grappelly,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2011
Stephanie Grappelly,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in

Stephanie Grappelly,"Three little words
Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days

And what I feel in my heart, they tell sincerely
No other words can tell it half so clearly
Three little words, eight little letters
Which simply mean I love you",Three Little Words,2011

Sans même me dire bonsoir

Vous, dont je guette un regard
Pour quelle raison, ce soir passez-vous sans me voir

Stephanie Hancock,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round Midnight,2001
Stephanie Hancock,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me

",My Reverie,2001
Stephanie Haynes,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows,1992
Stephanie Haynes,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1992
Stephanie Haynes,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1993
Stephanie Haynes,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1993
Stephanie Haynes,"Why can't you behave?
Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me,
And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why, why, why can't you be good?

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town,
Where we two can go and try settling down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in this world I crave.
Oh, why can't you behave?

Someone that turns your heart around

All that I've never tasted
Come wake me, let's make up for
All of the time we've wasted

I can barely breathe

Stephanie K,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?

What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

Since this morning when the sky was clear
With my paintbox in one hand
Remember last time when you were here

See the clouds come
Unfold the blank white sheet over me
Come cover me, consume me
Oh, oh what are we to do?

You know that I love you, I don’t want to lose you
Sometimes I just feel suffocated
I can feel when the clouds come
I can feel when the clouds come

I painted a picture
Stepped back to see
Saw you in a new light
How wrong could I be?

See the clouds come, oh, oh
See the clouds come

I’ve been walking and it feels like hours
I’ve got ear ache from the winter wind
From high up on the most Northern point
You said you’d tell me everything, everything

I painted a picture
Stepped back to see
Saw you in a new light
How wrong could I be?

See the clouds come, oh, oh
Unfold the blank white sheet over me
Come cover me, consume me
Oh, oh what are we to do?

I’ve been crying through the seagulls
And I’ve been swept up on the shoreline
Feeling bleak as the white sky
And I’m cold, I’m cold, cold and I’m going home

Come cover me yeah, come cover me

Stephanie Lawrence,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored,1988
Stephanie Lawrence,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [Cats],1988

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1974

I had a talk with God last night
I cried Oh Lord please make things alright

Please call Him to guide me right
Let me find peace and a better life

Had a very shiny nose. 
And if you ever saw him, 
You would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer 
Used to laugh and call him names. 
They never let poor Rudolph 
Join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say: 
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Seek a harbinger of spring

[Chorus]",When I'm Nothing,2001
Stephanie Mills,"Looking back in retrospect 
ItÂ´s  funny how we Ive seen,
The laughs and frowns, the ups and downs,
ItÂ´s a part of destiny.
Some wish upon a star and hopes one day that wish comes true,
But I wouldnÂ´t change one simple thing the chance of loving You!

[Chorus]
Born for this, destined for greatness,
I was prepared for this;
Your Strength for my weakness,
I found that loving someone is easy 
And learned with love that comes a risk
And in my quest to find the answer,
Found I was born for this.

What we donÂ´t  know, time will tell.
This I do believe;
When a child is born the angels sing 
In perfect harmony
That doesnÂ´t  means just happiness, 
ThereÂ´s  always room for rain.
But if we learn, what Autumn knows, 
That Spring will come again!

[Chorus]

ThereÂ´s a time to live and a time to die
So letÂ´s celebrate each moment of our life.
And if we ever lose our way, because the heart is torn
Never let it question whyÂ´s  the reason that weÂ´re born.

Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
I won't put my hands up in surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be",White Flag,2017

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

Up off the ground where you abandoned things

Things had barely gotten underway
Before my innocence would be betrayed
Starting with a phone call, a family member dies
And at the funeral I looked into your eyes
For the first time, this was a dream of mine
But you didn't know me, you didn't know my name

The first words you spoke to me
Since you left my family
You didn't call me Stephanie
This will take some getting over don't you agree

But now I'm here
I know it's been a few years
I've shed a few tears and now I have a few things to say
When we met, you broke my heart
14 years old and you tore me apart
But that aside, please know I love you
And more than that, I forgive you

Meeting at a truck stop for lunch
We covered basics, let's keep in touch
Not even a week later, a letter in the mail
You think it's better to let this fail
Another attempt to get to know my father
Efforts exhausted, why did I bother

The first words you wrote to me
Since I made you family
They worried me to the worse degree
This will take some getting over don't you agree

And now it's been a few years

They still say I love you

No matter what the future brings

Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate

Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
On this you can't deny

And to look before I leap
To think about what I should say
Long before I speak
Well, I'm tired of holding back my true emotions
I can't help but cause a little commotion

I like shakin' things up
I like pushing the boundaries
I like living my life on the edge
And chasing farfetched dreams
I'm gonna feel young when I grow old
I'm gonna challenge the status quo
When being good just ain't good enough
I like shakin' things up

I've been know to aim too high
And sometimes I've missed my mark
But I'll never know how far I can go
Until I go too far
I believe in moderation
But once in awhile I need a celebration

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

"Stephen ""Tebes"" Douglass","The game of ""just supposing"" is the sweetest game I know,
Our dreams are more romantic than the world we see.
And if the things we dream about don't happen to be so,
That's just an unimportant technicality

We could make believe I love you,
Only make believe that you love me.
Others find peace of mind in pretending,
Couldn't you? Couldn't I? Couldn't we
Make believe our lips are blending
In a phantom kiss, or two, or three?
Might as well make believe I love you,
For to tell the truth, I do.

Your pardon I pray, 'twas too much to say,
The words that betray my heart.
We only pretend, you do not offend,
In playing a lover's part.

Though the cold and brutal fact is you and I have never met,
We need not mind convention's P's and Q's,
If we put our thoughts in practice we can banish all regret
Imagining most anything we choose

It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her

I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work

So was my future bride

But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

Not an overnight fling

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King

Look down where He lay

Stephen Bishop,"I remember all the women
Who cut me deep
Like footprints in the sand
Leading away from me

But I got me an island, a hideaway to hide in
When there's nowhere else to go

I let the trees sway, let the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one but me to blame

They took all I gave them
Threw my heart into the bay
So now I just lay in the palm tree
And throw my worries away

But I got me an island, a hideaway to hide in
'Til the sun breaks through these clouds

I let the trees sway, let the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one but me to blame

Some sunny day, something looking fine
Is going to wake me up, take me off this island
But she'll have to treat me right
Or it's back to my hideaway some night

Where the trees sway, where the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one to blame

I let the trees sway, let the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one but me to blame

Talk about love and romance,
Just wait till I get myself straight.
I'm gonna put Romeo's fame right smack dab outta date.
 
Finding a job tomorrow morning,
Got a little something I want to do.
Gonna buy something I can ride in
Take my girl dating at the drive-in,
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 

",(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet,1996
Stephen Bishop,"On first impression, I found you too good to be true
You touched my cheek said, ""You'll do""
I was shaking in my shoes

'Cause, I never thought this strange attraction
Would give me such a strong reaction
I look in your eyes and I get paralyzed

I go numb, I can't speak
Every time I look at you, my knees go weak
I wanna die inside, every time I look at you

In a world of white noise, you gotta stay cool
Can't lose your control and all the games I played
When I was a fool, now it's you I wanna hold

'Cause, I've waited for some inspiration
A woman of sophistication
But when I'm close to you I can't seem to move

I go numb, I can't speak
Every time I look at you, my knees go weak
I wanna die inside, every time I look at you

I asked the Moon above
Said, ""Tell me if what I feel is real?
Or just an accident of love

'Cause, now I'm living in her world
And I really think, I'm falling for this girl

I go numb, I can't speak
Every time I look at you, my knees go weak
I wanna die inside, every time I look at you
",I Go Numb,1996
Stephen Bishop,"(Stephen Bishop)
I rub my eyes as I wake from sleep
And leave behind
The world of my dreams
And through' my window I can see the sky
But I never see the sun

Someday
Someday
I shall fly
I want to close my eyes
In the Italian Rain
In the Italian Rain

The world outside is so far away
From this little bridge
Nothing is real
But the tears on faces
Where love has gone away

Somewhere Somewhere

I shall fly
I long to close my eyes
In the Italian Rain
In the Italian Rain

Tell me
Have they captured the moon?...



",Italian Rain,1996
Stephen Bishop,"Well the Sun pokes through' Blonde Street
And shines on the cracks
On the walls and the heartaches
And they never shine back

Patsy clutches her rosary
And from her window she sees
Lots of social interaction
From the people down on Blonde Street

through' the peephole she sees the Landlord
Who's come for more than her rent
He says, ""I'm kicking you out pronto.
Unless your body gives me consent""

But Patsy won't give into just any guy
Crushed like a grape
From where she must hide...you see
Life is not her cup of tea...yeah
But she says,

""I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET
I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET""

There's a baby in the next room
Watchin' some guy die on T.V.
There are lovers in the basement
Havin' some kind of touchin' spree

Down the hall there's young Jimbo
Who's got his heart in hell
'Cause the girlfriend he got pregnant
Is going on Sally Jesse Raphael

Patsy laughs at her girlfriends
They're tryin' to marry someone rich
They all hang around the sofa and say
""Hey, ain't love a bitch?""

And Mars is a Planet
Where she'll find her man
She'll sail through' the black hole
'til it's his arms she's in

With eyes like Walnuts and Cinnamon skin
She won't be living the life of a Nun
And that's what she gets...

(CHORUS)

Her memories don't mean nothing
So she throws them away
Like that night in his bedroom
When he looked just like
A Young Hemingway
And she was the, ""Catch of the Day""...

Now she's walkin' down Blonde Street
Where there's so many places to hide
She's got a River of denial
Of what's locked up inside...

But she just wants to Fly...
And she says...

""I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET
I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET""

Lives a girl dear to me
She is ever so fair
Wears a rose in her hair
Like the Rose of Trailee

When I sail so far away
To a far distant bay
Always dreaming of her
Each dream seems to say

Dreaming of you
And Silver Sails out on the blue
The sails that soon will take me
Across the sea to you

Heavenly you
Beneath the skies of Azure Hue
Oh sails, please come and take me
Across the Sea to You

Each night I sit and dream
Beautiful dreams of you
And as I sit and scheme
Each dream comes true

Dreaming of you
And all the things
That will come true
For I shall soon be sailing
Across the Sea to You

Each night I sit and dream
Beautiful dreams of you
And as I sit and scheme
Each dream comes true

And all the things
That will come true
For I shall soon be sailing

",Across the Sea to You,2003
Stephen Bishop,"Night is falling
Here in the darkness
I can see
Someone like me
Is calling out
Wondering how my hopes and plans
Slipped through my hands

But it's alright
It's okay
I'll never understand it
It just turned out that way
It's Alright
It's okay
I still have my
Dreams of Someday

I can hear them
Shouting my name
Out from the crowd
Cheering loud
I hear them now
Everything I was meant to be
Guess it wasn't meant for me

CHORUS

Time is just a photograph
I can't go on
Living for the memories

Tonite, it's okay
Even if where I'm going
Is a million miles away
It's alright
It's okay
'cause I still have my
Dreams of Someday...



",Dreams of Someday,2003
Stephen Bishop,"I watch her through revolving doors
Through the windows of trains
On the stairway to the second floor
On crowded street covered with rain
She rushes by and I call out her name

Somehow she disappears...

So I wait for her by the cafe light
Where strangers meet
At the end of the night
And I wait for her to come to me
The Girl in the Orange Sweater

She accidentally took my seat
Pulled off her white gloves
I was captured by the look on her face
A masterpiece of beauty and grace

Just travelers passing the time...

So I wait for her by the Cafe light
Where she missed her train and
We talked all night..
And I wait for her to come back to me
The Girl in the Orange Sweater
The Girl in the Orange Sweater

And when I close my eyes I see
A cold and lonely world
If she's not there with me...

And I wait for her to come back to me
The Girl in the Orange Sweater...



",The Girl in the Orange Sweater,2003
Stephen Bishop,"She was late
To the party
Couldn't find a thing to wear
She looks just like Sharon Stone
Posing for Playboy
As she reads Voltaire

One more pretty girl
Crying the tears of a child
Now her boyfriend's
Trying to con some mafia guys
On Deuces wild
'till they say, ""HEY YOU!""

So he jumps out the window
Throws all the money in the
Back of his Jag
Then they chase him through town
They're gonna make him their new punching bag

But they lose him in jersey
Now he's with his girl back home
He says, ""I had a little trouble..pack your things
We're going to Rome
I been up all night
But I'll sleep on the plane""

It's gonna be a brand new life for us, my love
You'll wear your white Fake Fur
In the Vatican Hall...

You know I told 'em I don't take requests
I gotta get my beauty rest
So I'll Sleep on the Plane
Yeah I'll sleep on the plane....
Guess I'll sleep on the plane...



",I'll Sleep on the Plane,2003
Stephen Bishop,"I parked my Buick
Discovered my ticket was lost
And I had to fly ""Standby""
At twice the cost

and then the buzzer went off
At the Security check
And the hands on my body
Left me with no
Self-respect

And now my Suitcase don't fit
In the overhead
And the ugly blue Stewardess
Wishes that I
Would drop dead

So I climb into my seat
Next to the screaming baby
Next to the big, big fat man
Who's trying to steal my tan
Oh I know I won't sleep
And I'll get..

Jet Lag
Jet Lag
Yeah yeah

Now we're flyin' through the air
On this twenty hour flight
And my eyes can't seem to focus
And my head feels so light

And then the food tray comes around
And I eat like a pig
And the lady in blue says
""Baby, you better slow down
You're eyes are too big""

And if you think too much
Your brain'll start to drag
And you make it home to party
But your tail can't wag
Oh no, and guess what
You got.. (CHORUS)

I'd stop this plane
If I could
The hands on my watch
Say you don't look so good
The movie ain't so hot
You know this lousy feeling
Is all I got..

The plane lands with a thud
And I run to my car
And I tell my legs run faster
And they say who do you think you are?

So I call up my date
A September playmate
I gotta get myself together
No, I can't be late
She's so fine

And now she's kissing my ear
Says her clothes feel too tight
But as she moves a little closer
I fall asleep at the light
And she says, ""Oh baby, wake up,
You got Jet Lag!""

CHORUS



",Jet Lag,2003
Stephen Bishop,"I never knew what I could feel
Until I held you in my arms
You're like a dream
That seems so real
'Tho our worlds are far apart

And I would give to you
The moon, the stars
The Ocean and the Sky
My love, my soul, my heart
But I must hide this love inside
Of me

for the pleasure of your company

There is a light that shines in you
It showed me how to feel again
We opened a door
We can't walk through
Still our love will never end
And it can never be..

CHORUS

Silver sky, darkest night
Gentle rose, sun of light

Somewhere in another world
I'd have never let you go
I'll remember how you danced with me
And the pleasure of your company..

Rat Race

They come from everywhere
They're in your pants
They're everywhere
And they are looking for
Their little piece of cake

Yeah, there's one in every crowd
Who doesn't want to shut his mouth
But he better get his butt
Out of the way...

RAT RACE

They push and pull and stick you
Then they knock you down and lick you
When you turn your back
They catch you by the tail...

If your perfect plan's a bungle
It's the law in every jungle
If they ask you, just say you don't inhale......

Hear the angels sing
They're calling me..

But I lose the key..

",Rat Race,2003
Stephen Bishop,"The light has faded in the blue room
Where love has strayed
And in the colors of her darkness
She turns away

from the kind of hurt
That tears your heart to pieces
'Till you say goodbye

Well I don't see her anymore
It's for the best, I guess
And I don't see her anymore
So I kill time
Thinking that she's not mine

The moon has stolen all the memories
From my brain
So I watch the people on my TV
To hide my pain

and sometimes I can't
Imagine life without her..
And sometimes I can

But I don't see her anymore
Time will tell
When I can wish her well
I don't see her anymore
But I get by
Knowing that she's not mine

Like a mountain that stands so high
Her tears mean nothing to me
'Cause I'm too blue to cry

and somedays all I do
Is think about her

yeah, but I don't see her anymore
It's for the best, I guess
And I don't see her anymore
And Life goes by
Knowing that she's not mine...

I watched my sky fall
I lost a photograph
Of you,
Laughing

Now I must learn how to crawl..

I think I've nearly lost my mind
Do you love me?
I ask, ""Is there another man?""
And all you say is..

There There
There There

It's been two weeks now
In my little hell
Still you won't say
Where you are

I sent a telegram
To your Parental retreat
There is no refuge too far

I think I've really lost my mind
Do you love me?
I bought a ticket to your arms
And all you can say is there there..

From my love career
I have to see you

Warm rain is falling
As we lay down on green grass..

But he says, ""No No...my Baby Blue
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save you""
He says, ""No..no
You know it's true""

You need someone to
Rescue you..

From a life of neglect
And Daddy's money
Couldn't buy self-respect

With every stupid guy
She screwed in Hampton Town

Might as well forget it

In the blue twilight
Call out her name

All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)

They go lots of pretty women
Steal your money
Then they break your heart

On and on
She just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying

Sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder
Steals the stars from the sky

Stephen Bruton,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be
My hillbilly hula gal, my hillbilly hula gal

Stephen Bruton,"Working in a graveyard on a skeleton crew
Everyday above ground, is just too good to be true
Living in uncertainty is such a reality
It take nothing for granted, you got no secrets to keep
You just watch for hidden motives, reading right between the lines
The horizon keeps expanding by a thin blue line

And every single picture is more than meets the eye
They will just defend the truth if you even ask why
An old woman working on the favorite song
Dogs may bark but the caravan moves along

Standing at the crossroads where the middle meets the ends
And I'm hope six ways to Sunday, by some long lost friends
And I thought I heard the river that runs right through my past
I hollered which way are you going, I heard I thought you'd never ask

I'm a voice of wind and water, a man of flesh and bone
I was right next to the river, together and alone
Sometimes you glimpse the truth when it's long gone
Dogs may bark but the caravan moves along

I stumbled drunk upon a side street without a clue, without a care
I saw the wind move on the water just enough to know it's there
And I felt my world was slipping and my knees went weak
And I might as well let the stars are floating all around my feet

You tried to reconstruct the crime scene with a handful of clues
Think you know where I've been going by staring at my shoes
And if you're gonna talk about me when I'm gone
Dogs may bark but the caravan moves along, the caravan moves along",Dogs May Bark,1999
Stephen Bruton,"The night like ships that drift the clouds float by
They brought no rain, they brought no dreams
The moon kaleidoscopes the ground
The darkness is as sure as death

The moon, above it on a single pearl
Surrounded by her floating sisters
Blink like the eyes of souls to come
Scattered like some broken glass

But under the horizon, under the horizon
Nothing stays the same, the sacred and profane
Under the horizon

This world, it spins so fast, it keeps us down
The shadows move, they stop the sun
Days have no names and fall like leaves
In rhythm to an endless dance

This life, it finds its way in fits and starts
Laughter, tears and broken parts
Like spin one way and never stop
These vision's from a fevered dream

Under the horizon, under the horizon
Nothing stays the same, the guilty and the blamed
Under the horizon",Under the Horizon,1999
Stephen Bruton,"Darkness had us covered 
When we split from Minnesota 
In the morning
In the rain 
Black as I was feeling and the street was slick and shiny as a snake 
Each of us was a-humming to a half forgotten echo 
Hangin' over in the brain 
Tappin' time and thinking of the time we never had the time to take

Losing to the rising cost of living high and loving hard 
And leavin' every yesterday behind 
Learning every bridge you cross, 
Is burning down before you're off and running 
Like the devil just in time

Breakin' any ties before they bind you
Taking any comfort you can find
Running like you're running out of time
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding 
When you're headin' for the border lord 
You're bound to cross the line

Good lookin' women every time you stumble 
Waitin' there to catch you when you fall 
Gettin' to you bad enough to let em 
Keep you backin' up till just before your back's against the wall

Breakin' any ties before they bind you
Takin' any comfort you can find
Runnin' like you're runnin' out of time

And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock

It's been eight years since I left you babe

I am the morning DJ on WOLD
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen
The drinking I did on my last big gig made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are

Stephen Chapman,"Hello honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around

The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen

They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car

But I'm not about to collect my cards
There are a hundred thousand people
Who would take my place

So we could drive off in the Austin
To the steeplechase
Working, but thinking about you

I can smell you in my clothes
And feel you in my bones
Every minute counts
When you're away from home

I'll be there
Because I care for you
I'll be there
Because I care for you

Whisper, I don't know where I'm going
Can't move without you knowing
The ups and downs

The stopping train is loading up with sentiment
The backyard breeze is blowing back its sacrament
Whisper, I don't know where I'm going

I don't apologize
Love is always right
So never compromise

The stars are bright in the abyss

I tried to make a joke
You didn't seem to listen
The café was full of smoke
And I was fiercely bitten

The wind outside could bite
But love for you was savage
Was my conversation trite
Or weighed down with luggage?

She's got a lot of problems
She's got a lot of problems
She makes me quiver

The soft suede of her boots
""Admit you are neurotic""
Your Maxfield Parrish suits
""Is style like a narcotic""

But if I can't be debonair
I'll just be gaunt and Gothic
""Can we make a pair?""
Yes, that would be exotic

I love you passively
Tip toe to my kisses
Give me my best wishes

Stephen Duffy,"I wonder who's coming out today
To play in sheltered shopping centres
Sitting around the stagnant fountain
Counting pennies eating peanuts
Brown paper, babies and check out girls
In uniform and furniture boys
Who we used to know don't say hello
But that's okay that's okay

'Cause when the sun comes down
And you come home
We'll have two weeks all alone
Before you have to go back to school
Which ruins everything.

Wednesday Jones is growing up
And if she goes I'll never catch her
On the petrol station forecourt
All thumbs and old suede jacket
Catch the bus back to the house
The front room's ours and we can stay there
Stared out the window for an hour
Until I too went away went away

And we're apart
Another one must claim my heart
And Wednesday Jones and I won't be
Each others lover",Wednesday Jones,1985
Stephen Duffy,"You used to be so fancy free
Now you hardly look at me
You sweep the leaves out the road
And count the snowflakes when it snows

Let's cut away the undergrowth
Of a love that hurt us both
You stroked the cat when it purred
But go to sleep without a word

Let's work this out tonight
Sort out every silly fight
Now whistle half a love's duet
'Cause half a love is all you get
When you don't play your part
When you broke my heart

The wind howled through the corridors
Of a heart that still adores
Life with you when it's so good
Is a lesson learnt and understood

Love can make you feel a fool
Love's unkind and lovers are cruel
You make me wish I were dead
But I go and feed the cat instead

And I can't cope with being unhappy
When I know what makes me happy
And I love loving you
But I can't cope with what it makes me do

",Loves Duet [*],1985

Tie my shoe lace help me walk
But this time please don't make me talk

Of who I love and in what way
But Geraldine accepts me mute
For silence is a stronger suit.

On Geraldine and all those below
The passing years leave vapour trails
Or silver patterns like those of snails

But rain left sky and paving clear.

Its splinters slither in our skin

More than I can say for some
With just so many years to live
In which nothing gives
Two courting birds wheeled away

Against the opalescent grey

So I leave the table and go to my waiting friends
I'll never be the same again

That beats us every time
And now the only shadow here is mine
And I'm too tired to chase it
Across the Friday morning sky
Another day unfolds it's pictures

I trust the confusion that made us meet
Each sick note and turncoat that made him cheat
Now I know that it's worth trying
To cherish those that stop us crying
Who make us feel we're not alone
And help us roll away the stone

",The Waitress' Story,1995
Stephen Duffy,"I was born in Birmingham
But soon I would escape
With education incomplete
But two songs on a tape

When my girlfriend was expelled
We took the London coach
Her sister gave her daffodils
Her mother an old brooch

And she smiled
And she smiled and she smiled
She was so beautiful, 17
She was so beautiful, 17

We didn't have much money then
No Hi-Fi or TV
So, we made love, I'd sing her songs
And she would read to me

But we were young
I didn't know what love was all about
And when I slept with her best friend
Of course she threw me out

And we cried
And we cried and we cried
She was so beautiful, 17
She was so beautiful, 17

I was looking for a deal
Looking for a hit
The affectations of success
The airs that goes with it

While she was looking for a man
Who didn't need a maid
She modeled for an agency
Who made sure she got paid

And she smiled
And she smiled and she smiled
She was so beautiful, 17
She was so beautiful, 17
She was so beautiful, 17

I was an empty headed libertine

And I've not been right, for I don't know how long

I cry in my sleep, I laugh when you weep, I lie and I cheat
I talk with my feet, I'm running away, I'm lost and I long for oblivion

You gave me life, I gave you make believe
You wanted to be my wife, I wanted you to leave

Stephen Duffy,"I was born in poverty but when I was about nineteen
I wrote a song called 'Kiss Me', and soon it was pay day
A terraced house in that country, I thought that would do for me
It's seemed to be the lilac time, but when the lilac died
I went back to town and cried, I need someone who'll always love me

The day after someone dies, waking little lesser lies
Why do the wicked seem to survive, Eucharist song
We're little more alone, the moments took that were never known
They'll never see my happy home, you see them everyday
I know you want to say, you won't forget we'll always love you

When you're young and you fall down and cry
When you're old and you fall down and died
I am in between, there will never be
Anywhere or sincere with anyone that I find dear

Checking in around twilight, the hotel where we board the tonight
I run a path and pack some books, which we will embrace
Told me that your father died, when you buried him you cried
You're sorry and you are surprised, he died and you were born
So you don't have to mourn, live your life alone, always love you
Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you",Eucharist,1998
Stephen Duffy,"I don't remember receiving your postcard
I never got much post so it shouldn't have been too hard
You were on holiday with your school in some French town
And when you were away I took Debbie to the crown

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

I found your postcard and I put it on the wall
I found your picture, you know tears were bound to fall
I didn't write your songs when we were going out
So why should I start now, you are not about

I feel as though the past in closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

We hardly used to even drink, we didn't smoke
We'd walk home from the pub 'cause we were always broke
So when your mother called and said that you were dead
Thought she's talking of another Kim instead

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

She said it seemed you accidentally overdosed
It was so long since I talked to her and once we were so close
And I am left with all these things I didn't say
And a picture of you in my arms, the day you went away

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

I feel as though the past is closing in on me

The love that she expresses when nothing can be said
Pennies in a stream, my love songs unrequited
And all the dicks you slighted are at your door

Where you wrote, love is all, you meant it you know you did
Where others see the mother of another child
I still see, your eyes ablaze and wild outside your faculty

She belongs to all, among the facts and fictions
The crutches and addictions of everyday
Even in the grey, solar energy is transmuted
The one thing that can't be disputed is on its way

Most of it's live will have to forgive you

You are open to all of my suggestions

But you'll get your way this time
You cannot stay in this hole
You'll get away this time

Warm with wayward hope
Your kisses breathless, your love divine
You left drama school for shop floor
Restless, not by design

You are tired of provincial boutique, Sundays
You want the mythical New York
And Champs Elyse

They get their way most times
But you'll get your way this time
You cannot stay in this hole
You'll get away this time

Never try to profit with fortune you can't stop it
I'm afraid you will succeed
To find what capitals are cleaner
The grass is so much greener
Please don't ever go to seed

But you'll get your way this time
You cannot stay in this hole

Like blood onto a clean white sheet

To innocence my only debt

Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay
The stars are bright in the abyss

But I don't know if I'm prepared to listen
The answer is skin deep
Where can I find a simpler complexion?

Maybe I can, maybe I can't
Maybe a baby or maybe a plant
I could buy a gun, a new pair of shoes
I'll make you unhappy
So don't make me choose

Between the devil I know, the devil I don't
A lover who loves me and a lover who won't
Accept that I'm so confused
About love and love I have refused

I'll get a lot of ink out of our affair
I'll get a lot of ink out of our affair
It's over the kitchen sink with flowers in our hair
But baby, I don't care

I want what I can't have
But if by chance I get it I don't want it
I want to hold your hand
But holding hands holds
More demands than answers

Give me a kiss, give me a break
Give me a miss 'cause I won't stay awake
Beyond the flattery dash caught in a crush
A moment of pash before the pregnant hush

Is it two hearts or three? Shaken or stirred?
Give me an answer or give me the bird
Oh, won't you tell me about the loves in your life?
You're nobody's fool and nobody's wife

You, you execute love's pas de deux
But you think you're just par for the course
And your kisses have no strings attached
And your love is always left on the latch

You're such a sweet thing
Not a catch phrase or a dance craze
But the nature of my success
Seems to make your tears jingles for singles

",A Lot of Ink,2001
Stephen Duffy,"In the summer and her pinafore
She thought she'd love for ever more
How soon things sour

Past the bewitching hour she finds
Herself in winter deep inside her coat
The past is just an anecdote
She can't forget for it's her alphabet of time

Will there be a war
Will she die or will she know?
And find the pain of youth still shows?

Like Mary Tyler-Moore
She stares across the yawning tide
Out of love and terrified

In the Sunday color magazine
She reads a line and then she dreams
Of what she'll do when she leaves you again

She knows that home
Was once a wild unknown
As always her own chaperon
Catch the bus from wilderness or to

Hold on tight, catch that bus
Fares please, ding ding ding

Then you might just see it's not so funny

Prey tell
The wishing well will get you eventually
Beware
What you are is what you're doing there

Love is lingering with you on it's mind
And it's giving you a moment so kind

Believe
Your broken heart could heal so dramatically
And with a little luck
You could see a better way again real soon

As we stare into each other's eyes
And each year just goes so fast and goodbye

Look around
What your friends are telling you so free
Be gone
It's all over as the sun does set once more

If you think that love has a chance with you
Maybe hope can shine a light so true

Just smile
You can win the victory so sweet
And know
It's just another day for you and me

And tomorrow ? no more sorrow
You can all her - if you want to

There's a new way ? why won't you try it
Heaven sent it and you'll believe it now

Love can save you now

While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat

Please don't walk away - leave me behind
With these crazy feelings
No one is to blame - ain't that a shame
But I still believe in you, oh you
You're my every dream come true
That is why
I just can't say goodbye

Here I'm lying in my bed alone
What do I feel - another page is turning
Once again another chapter's closed
And in my mind I see our bridge is burning

I am falling and I can't get up
Seems so far to reach the top
The way I feel for you will never stop
(Won't you) Listen to me

[Chorus]
Don't want to walk away
Don't want to let you down
Don't want to see you crying
Just want to see you smile

I'll never walk away
I'll never let you down
I'll never leave you crying
I just can't say goodbye

[Chorus]

Oh babe, you, oh you
You're my every dream come true
And that is why
I just can't say goodbye

I remember a love so strong
Good bad times, were carelessly so free

I heard from my friends you were cheating on me
I sat up waiting it was quarter past three
You said you stopped, that you quit playing around
But I finally found out

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

And your eye upon the rail

Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us

You will cross the bridge of strife
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life
Always mindful of obstruction
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Stephen Hill,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!

Be with them at the door!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me

You won't believe me 

All you will see is a girl you once knew 
Although she's dressed up to the nines 
At sixes and sevens with you 
I had to let it happen, I had to change

I never invited them in 
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired 
They are illusions 

They're not the solutions they promised to be 
The answer was here all the time 
I love you and hope you love me

Stephen Hill,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored [From Evita],2005

What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days, when I've seen myself

I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man. He's just a man

And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought I'd come to this

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope

I'd turn my head. I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know

Stephen Hill,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],2005

Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure. 
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die. 
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the hills, the tunnels
Never falter, never quail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us
Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In thy praise for evermore

You will cross the bridge of strife
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life
Always mindful of obstruction
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

You will often find obstruction
Look for storms of wind and rain
On a hill, or curve, or trestle
They will almost ditch your train
Put your trust alone in Jesus
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train will guide
There you'll meet the superintendent

Where the wind blows strong but never at her back
Seventeen when her mama died
She said the hardest thing was saying goodbye

And she cried Oklahoma
So much more we could have done
Oklahoma
You let her die here way too young 
She was way too young

A leap of faith took her to Tennessee
Where she met a boy who looked like me
She fell in love while he played the part
Then he broke her will just to break her heart

And she cried Oklahoma
So much more we could have done
Oklahoma
You let our love die way too young 
Ooh, we were way too young

She waited around
Hoping he would figure it out
Hoping he would see he was wrong
But he took too long 
And then the moment was gone

So late one night she decided to leave
Said she'd had enough of the hills in Tennessee
Headed home where the land is flat
With a gentle breeze steady at her back

Ooh, and she cried Oklahoma
So much still that's left undone

Fear made me blind
It filled my mind with so much doubt
Time after time I'd try to find
The easy way out

No I could not see how there could be something better
Waiting there for me on the other side of never

Then I saw a light gave up the fight
And I turned my whole world around
Just like a flame faith it came
And it burned that old house down

I wonder what she sees looking through the pictures in her mind
I wonder what it is she’s searching for she can’t seem to find
Can she leave this mess behind her
Will happiness ever find her through the pictures in her mind
In her mind
She searches for a harbor, searches for relief
But there’s no sign of redemption and no sign of peace
She’s alone in an open field in a pouring rain
She slides into another pill just to hide the pain

And only God can save her now

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

To a place where the river runs
Into your keeping, oh.

Comforts the seeking, lead on.

Heavy hearted boarding

In chambers made for sleeping, forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar

If nothing gold can ever stay you take the cards you’re dealt today

Some that I have failed to recognize
For all these kids and all this noise and all that time spent with the boys

If rock n’ roll can save your soul
It’s also gonna take its toll 
You get the things you give
And I gave this a lot
Buddy Holly, Stevie Ray, Harry Chapin, Jim Croce  but not my name today

If it’s something you don’t want to hear, then keep your hands upon your ears
Remember though that there will come a time 
When all you’ve said is all you’ll say, you might as well kill me today

Stephen Kellogg & the Sixers,"Shot through with adrenaline to fire up my excited 
Help me believe in myself, get the starter to start
Fifteen burning balls of fire, ten days since we left
No one understands me like the whiskey on my breath

Ten minutes to showtime, Baby stop your crying
Everybody knows why, There’s just no time

See you later, See you soon
See you later alligator, I will see you in the moon

Suicide club’s on a mission 
Cause they hate their jobs and other guys
Everything’s tougher then it has to be, 
Another cliché from the wise
But somewhere east of that solo 
And a little bit west of the bridge
Was the singular kind of moment 
You remember as long as you live

Sometimes just before showtime, I swear I might end up crying
Letting go of my fears and my landlords
That’s the difference between living and dying

As kids we’d pretend to be pirates
And talk about starting a band
But the older that we got, the more that we forgot
That greed and treasure go hand in hand

See you later, See you soon
See you later alligator, I will see you in the moon
See you later, See you soon
Are the words I always say
See you later, See you soon, maybe on some sunny day
See you later, See you soon
See you later little button, I will try to get home soon","See You Later, See You Soon",2005
Stephen Kellogg & the Sixers,"It’s hard to live in front of the world 
There’s only so much that you can pretend 
Write down what it is you’re thinking 
Take each day as it comes 
You never know what’s hanging ‘round the bend 

As far from the world as we get I can swear that the two of us will always be the same 
Figure out what it is you believe in 
And if you must choose 
try not to trade your fortune in for fame 

And you’ll learn, learn, learn
You’ll wait your turn, turn, turn
 You’ll get sick on the way 
By the things that people say 
It’ll break your heart against the wind 
But you will just keep breathing in 

If you’re scared to live in front of the world 
I’ve got news for you, you should be then 
When your confidence gets low and you’ve got nowhere to go 
Just remember how you felt about me and our friends 

And we’ll learn, learn, learn
We’ll wait our turn, turn, turn 
We’ll get sick on the way 
By the things that people say 
It’ll break our hearts against the wind 
But we will just keep breathing in

Watch the way you fall in love
 If you’re smart, you’ll take it slow 
Don’t ask me about it, cause I don’t know, 
I don’t know, know, know

But I’m gonna learn, learn, learn

Jessica’s afraid she won’t find love 
she says that she’s never home 
Just last night I swear I heard her say “What if I die alone?” 
And this broken-hearted attitude, you know it fits right in 
To this movie about all of us that’s waiting to begin 

I’ve been chasing dreams in magazines the last 10 years 
The way you treat your lover’s up to you 
But it can’t feel all that good to be so jealous

 We’ll feel more alive

Sweet baby don't cry
Tonight
Daddy is here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby
Tonight
Why can't it all be like it was before?
How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?
Cause daddy likes porno and ten dollar whores
Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores
Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus
I think that's why mommy left us
Mommy left us
Hush little girl
There is no reason to fret
Tonight
Don't mind the smoke
Daddy just wants to forget
Tonight

Soon it will all be like it was before
Any minute she will walk through that front door
But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer
Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear
Daddy has sores on his naughty parts oozing with puss
I think that's why your mommy left us
Please don't cry
I swear I'll try
To be here by your side
Right after daddy gets home from the bar
Visits his bookie
And steals a new car
He'll drive to the strip club
And if daddy plays his cards right
He'll bring home your new mommy tonight",Lullaby (Divorce Song),2000

You turned to me and smiled ""a baby's on the way"",

I would be awesome man
I'd fly around the world fighting crime
According to my awesome plan
And if I saw criminals trying to lie
Hurting other people and making them cry

'Cause I would be awesome man

Now, some criminals want you to be a criminal, 
And they offer you things like drugs, alcohol. 
But we know what to do, kids. We just say ‘no'.

I would be drug-free boy
Telling the world of the evils of drugs
And all of the lives they destroy
Well I'd take all the junkie

With their needles and bongs
And their sticks made of Thai
As I burn them alive I would squeal with joy

I'd pass a lot of laws to get rid of their brood

To run off to fucking Hawaii with some doctor named Bob
You could skin them and drain them of blood so they die (especially Bob)
Then you would be justice guy

Or you could be more subtle
No I didn't mean to be vague

Could tell I soiled my good name
By the look upon your face.

No use denying it, I was really cranking it
Now dry your eyes, don't be so sad
If you could just forgive me, and talk to me, dad

I didn't hear you enter, no I didn't hear the door
With my hand upon my member and my pants upon the floor
A burden to your brain is an image you despise
Like blood and guts and starving kids and Stevie Wonder's eyes

Now dry your eyes, don't be so sad
But I wouldn't use those tissues; they've already been had, talk to me dad

The look upon your face made my swollen glad diminish
So I said ""close the door, I really wanna finish."" 
Now daddy, I'm ashamed and I completely understand
If you never wanna hug again or even shake my hand

Well it seems last night you caught me spanking it
No use denying it, I was really cranking it
Now dry your eyes, don't be so sad
Just because it was your bed, it's not that bad

When I was only 17 you told me it was dirty
So it must be really creepy when you kid is pushing 30
But you cannot tell me, dad, you have never had a whack
At the thing that hangs below your belt and bumps into your sack

Well it seems last night you caught me spanking it
No use denying it, I was really cranking it

So I brought him down to the fishin' hole 
Didn't like the feelin' of that worm in his hand 
Got mad, threw down his fishin' pole 

Said, ""That's alright, son. Let's go and get an ice cream"" 
""Let your old man buy you a treat"" 
But he didn't like no flavors up upon that wall 
Started crying, and ran into the street... 

He's an asshole, my kid's an asshole 
I swear it just don't float my boat 
Always crying, always crying 
Made me wanna punch him in his little throat 
Called my lady up to tell her what had happened 
How our son had run away 
She said, ""Don't worry, baby, I will talk to him"" 
""And everything will be okay"" 

My lady's an asshole, she's an asshole 
Her assholishness is off the charts 
Always perfect, always perfect 
Made me wanna punch her in her lady-parts 

I decided I'd go down to the bar 
And drown my sorrows in a beer 
But the sign outside said 'Closed For Renovations' 
'We'll open up again next year'... 

That bar is an asshole, it's an asshole 
Oh, the worst bar in the land! 
Always closing, always closing 
Can't punch a bar, cause you'll hurt your hand 
I went home to forget about my troubles 
Sat down in my favorite eazy chair 
But I couldn't relax from the pain I was feelin' 
As my hemorrhoid began to flair... 

My asshole's an asshole, a real butthole 
Needs to put his asshole-self in check! 
Always burning, always itching 
Made me wanna punch him in his asshole neck 

Late one night, lyin' awake in bed 
Mmmm, a realization came 
Are there really assholes everywhere I look? 
Or am I the one to blame? 
Maybe I just do not say the things I should say 
And I don't do the things I ought 
So I took a good, hard look at myself in the mirror 
And this is what I thought... 
The guy who sold me this mirror is an asshole, he's an asshole 
Son of a bitch said it was antique 
He was lyin', he was lyin' 
Made me wanna punch him in his salesman cheek 

I'm on a real asshole streak 
I could open up an asshole boutique

Its true, 'cause I'm prettier than you.

Who is not what he says
And you know when you're dry, what you're thinkin
Trout in the brook, you're about to get hooked
To a greedy false un-catholic knave

The black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why (2x)

I took the locomotive to kreutzberg
Passed through the scenery
And passengers got on that train too
And they really surprised me when they said:

"" the black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why"" (2x)

I've got some friends
But I got some enemies too
And yes I got some people in between

Stumble on inflated stats

Already rented them out to my friend snake/schnake

A revelation
Uh listen to me
I'll tell you I'm about to run
The ceiling's are undone
Specialized victories
For overage whores
I felt up your feelings
And they left me no more time
To see what I want to find

Believe-- let it go
And leave--the shots in closing
Believe--discretion grove

To go there
Yea there's time, there's time, there's time
To go there

From sending all my selves to you

Stephen Malkmus,"At age 19 i was kidnapped by turkish pirates
Mediterranean thugs
After some torture they considered me their mascot
Cypriotic good luck
I had to taste the deck and many other things
I had to pay the piper with my wedding ring
And i would never see my family again

By 25 i was respected as an equal
My art was a knife
On countless raids i was the first one up the lanyard
Yeah i was seeking a fight
There is no time to pray
And there's no time to beg
And then it's off with an arm
Or it's off with a leg
And if i spare your life
It's because the tide is leaving

Oh yeah

By 31 I was the captain of a galleon
I was poseidon's new son
The coast of montenegro was my favorite target
It was ever so fun

Or steel hooks
We had no black eye patches
Or a starving cook
We were just killers with the cold eyes of a sailor
Yeah we were killers with the cold eyes of a sailor",The Hook,2001
Stephen Malkmus,"Greek gods are communing
Beneath the doric arch
And they talk how small we humans are
They drink to agamemnon
They toast his pyhrric march
And wait for the sacrifices

Shepherds herd in real time
Sheep are barley-grazing on a field of green
Vines ripen to find
Troy will prevail
Trojan curfews prevail

So we got smashed on ios
Down around some doric arch
And the trashed blonde scandi
Mistook me for a swede
Her slurred medieval accent
Was like a puddle at my feet
You could see chopped tobacco in her teeth

Flaccid
On a rock hard strip of concrete
Near a field of green

Does it hurt you?
So pale

Do you really care what, when, why, or how?
I came to crave your spastic touch
The honest way you move is too much
Before we can change we could levitate
Erase mistakes of the forest greats
Fermented minds could make them shake
Permission granted for the wolverine stakes,

A Love to tear you off

The formless matters of the brain
Inequality of the drifting chain
A moment I could learn to love
The salutations to the levels above
We'll split the difference, call it quits
This is no new romantic blitz-krieg
Pull off the foil and watch it break
A whisper's crushing all the sympathy gates

What you know is who you are, who are you?
Do you know who you are in the world? what is your world view?
What do you go through? , what has your life showed you?
What are you learnin in this so called life?
Do you have principle or do you blow with the wind
Do you wanna be free but don't know where to begin
Do you know your enemy from your friend, even you can
It's deep in this scannin the system that keepin us here
Will we survive, do you believe, are we afraid
Would you rather have control of your life, or be a slave
Show me a sign, a pig ain't no homey of mine
They own me what's mine, I show you if you loan me your nine
I'm only concerned for tables to turn
When the people learn the truth about the system, the cities will burn
And I stand firm, like chaka zulu, these crackers can't stop you
Who you?

This is what we be waitin for? 21st century we still poor
World war, they want me to kill four
What happened to the future they always predicted
With new science fictional things and space visits
I've seen two sides, us against them
Police troops ride with four to five men
Prison business is boomin, senators grin
People searchin for answers, where to begin
Capitilism born from the backs of blacks
White folks relax, live off the kick backs
Gettin work to the bone jo, build this country
Further exploided by class to make money
Filthy rich capilist with blood loot
Use main frames systems to bank and compute
With the next technology, credit to the wires
Internet growth the man more suppliers
Welfare, ederly checks and wage workers
All us, elephants trapped in they circus
Ain't fightin over man made chips no more
When the lights go out, it's gonna belong to the poor

Then I thought he wouldn't want to see me crumble
When he handed me the ball I promised I won't fumble
And I won't, stood on the field implore the real
These player haters hate so much now they resolve to kill
Got your pictures it ain't the same without the laugh
I pour liquor in the grass think about the past

If there was no one I could speak with I could speak with you
You knew all I was into what I've been through
They couldn't fuck with us kid we was off da chain
Blew the spot up when we came and got inside the game
From street cats we brought it to the main stream
It was an honor playin' with you on the same team
Your namely a very great deal to me
It's only right I step it up you kept it real with me

And when that day comes
We're gonna be like every children
And when that day comes
Everyone is gonna enjoy themselves

Aiyo, I'm thinkin' yous about to come through at any minute
Bless your nigga on the track, put some flavor in it
Just a thought, I'm knowin' that you're not around
Can't forget how we did it in and out of town
Held it down, maintained, still inside the game
Listen ever since you left it hasn't been the same
Niggaz change, fam lookin' at me strange
Was goin' on with cheeks peeps hating different things

No doubt I'm hearing everything they say
He don't live around they way, why should I stay?
I play the hook but don't stay understand that

Mack to wrist to my girl I love the best
But when you left me it's like a bullet to my chest
Now I got to say I got a bullet through vest
Knocked off my feet I pleaded no contest
Sleepless nights without no sleep or rest
This is like a muffin jury you got to mix
Take it no more and had to make her confess
Sometimes I feel I'm in the Wild, Wild West
Lost the love I had now I live to the death

[Stephen Marley (Damien Marley)]
Long as I she caught me lying I get caught for lying
If she sure believe then sure believe is the sign
But listening to promises what a fool am I
Can somebody tell me? You know all his life
I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losing my mind
The news that your moving got me standing outside
Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine
Mrs. Lovely Vessel body all mine
Girl went to shoot me with the shoot all mind
Sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
Cause there's no where to go since you left me behind
(Now it's TRUE, TRUE) that I loved you for truth
(TRUE, TRUE) she stick like ankle glue
(TRUE, TRUE) I make your gray skies blue
(TRUE, TRUE) you want me pers-nal boo
Chilling up on the house our love be that strong

It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried

On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun
Didn't know that you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you

Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic

And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do
To be a better man
Cuz if I was to just to act a fool
Do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed
My world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and
Think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through
When the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you'll find it in your heart
And know these words are true
And please don't fuss
Because I must go do what I must do

Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cuz if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains

A time, a space, a different place
How perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows
You'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day
You'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny

I hope you'll find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry
Cuz you know that I must do what I must do


Well and it's not easy
Jah knows how I try, I try
So don't you get weary
Jah knows how I try, I try

God knows
Life is one big road
With alot of signs and turns & twists and curves
Even though the road is rocky
My main thing's to rock and keep on rockin'
From city to city
Backyard to yard
And we be seein' the sights, standin' under the lights
And the spot is hot, it's cold and lonely at night
And I'm feenin' and I'm dreamin' and I'm holding you tight
But hold on, every single road I roll on
Comes to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry, there's no valley low and there's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grows more,
And just keep strong
And even though I'm gone, I am never too far
You're the light through the dark, shining right through my heart
So my journey must start",Hey Baby,2004

Stephen Marley,"This is real, this is real

Now I see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
Miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
Strength of Ras Tafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey parents, maybe they will obey me
Future for the babies
Hopes for the babies
Tommorrow for the babies
No sorrow for the babies
Babies having babies
Raising our babies
All of these young ladies
Give them thanks and praises
How long can she take it?
Dreams are full of 'maybes',
Will she ever make it?
Hustles on a daily

In the club she shake it, strip down 'till she naked
Don't ever mistake it, Much too real to fake it
Need it then she'll take it
She'll do it for the babies
A mother's love is sacred
Now you don't you ever fail me

A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring

Is there no other option than adoption for you babies
You're raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
Strength of Ras Tafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
Cowards play the game thing
Fathers do the brave thing
And that's participating
He keeps on concentrating
There is no debating
No running away thing
A new life is awakening, From his ejaculating,
It's in the oven baking
Takes two for the making
He's right there through the cravings
And early morning waking

School and educating
Sports and recreating, Karate and ballet thing
Teenager of today thing
Fathers still relating, still communicating
And they'll always embrace him
Cause they cannot replace him

A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring

And always do your very best to keep a promise to your babies
And if you can't be good, at least be honest to your babies
The strength of Ras Tafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will o
History of the babies
Beginning of the ages
You're flipping thru the pages
And up and thru the 80's
Some are gang related, Drug affiliated
Some intoxicated, Headed for the snake pit
And Papa's locked in cages
And Mama's lacking wages
And this what they're faced with, upon a daily basis

Bleaching out dem faces
Running from dem races
Shooting up them places
Killing other babies
As bitter as the taste is, And words can not explain it
Just walk the narrow pavement
And speak of love not hatred",For the Babies,2005
Stephen Marley,"And yes y'all, you now rocking with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I split up in here with the brothers from the Marley family
Creston--we gon' say it for y'all

She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
Hey, she'd be laughing when there ain't no joke

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

Cause coke was a thing that once she first try
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
Now she's wondering who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar,
Like born to be wild but she sillier
Not quite the same, but she similar
A waste of my sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos, now she look hideous

Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Walks the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy's
She love lime light more than John Swaby's
Seen more miles than a Rent-A-Avis
She don't slow down then someday maybe
She lost and can't find her way to safety

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

Check it out
She keep her head up in the space like a satellite
Because she got an insatiable appetite
For staying out late nights with all the parasites
Plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she'd be back in line
Five minutes she stay on the move,
She'd done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up alone, she ain't even in tune
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use

She was pretty girl
Cleaner than the Board of Health
Studied and enjoyed herself, I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay'
And now she on the track, working while she wasting away
It's safe to say, she looking for a someplace to stay
Who ever got a little paper to play
Can get a slice of this

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

For no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirting
Now she season in and don't need rehearsing
Esteem get a beating, life is uncertain
Ego need feeding, now the wants worsen
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiending, swearing and cursing
Behind the curtains, she's really hurting
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
And she without sin will spark the first stone
The feeling kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass going 'bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King of Kings lift her off the floor
Saying, ""Life is a thing when you learn you grow.""

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
I doubt she a-go mek it too far

She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
Mi wonder how she mek it so far",Pimpa's Paradise,2005

And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or I'm sitting with goons in a visiting room
Flip it, I could've been you
Behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for 'em
Or a shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see 'em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called

[Chorus]

Hey can you think of a color that you've never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you've never been?
Well is many are called
But them never deemed
Worthy for the cause
Cause them never clean
Help who help themselves
Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah
Like a Cherubim
Keep us strong through the winter like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems
All things are related and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keep his word, don't care what the plan is
Don't be astonished
Stumbling bocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, whoa!

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, yo,
Some people ask me if I feel the Zionists are real
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combination's of pain, joy, fear, and love
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren
Could've asked us why Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
It's like it's been exchanged for this penicillin

Who do I follow?
Who do I copy?
Look in to the mirror
And it's you I see look at me
Everything new
Like it fresh from the factory
Everything you do?
It impact me
Your lifestyle attract me
Parents try distract me
When I grow up
I want to be like you exactly (exactly)
And as soon as I get over this acne
There's no way anybody coulda stop me

Me gravitate toward the aura
And all the mannerism
The sending out of orders
And man start moving busy
The locking of the corners?
The streets and all the buildings
Me love you like a father
Me ready and me willing
Anything what you a talk
Is law in my dominion
And me have similar thoughts
I share the same opinions
Me have it say you smart
With me best interest at heart
I'm following your path
Yow mine when you a walk

They appeal to the conscious
The Paramount
The Cesar, the monsters
The grandiose, the matters
The hell on earth pompous

The Harlemites the Garveyites
Black as the credit card we swipe
Poppin' Dom tonight
For all of mine
I can see myself back at the Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium
Shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those
Place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems
That were left behind
By holy men
Infectious
Charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexes
Resistance against oppression
Progressive thinking
Ghetto speakers
Protesters against the colored
Only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon
The contradiction
The cross the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinning
On Esau's back inscription
That it was written
That nothing is coincidence'n
They took our leaders and they lynched them

Me feet hurt from shoes.

Is black de root, is blond de hair. 
Her eyelash false, her face is paint, 
And pads are where de girl she ain't!

A false friend is the hardest thing to see

Know just what you're worth

Well, well
Ships that sailed to distant places
Robbed us of our rights and words
History says that you've been betrayed us 
Talking of the Gods you serve
Here the rumbling in the sky
Tears that our forefathers cried
And today we're still in chase
Take the shackle from our minds

You're the corner stone
