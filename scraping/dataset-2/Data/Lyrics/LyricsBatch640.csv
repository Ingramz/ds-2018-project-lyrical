Mac,"[Featuring Da Hound Soulja Slim] 
Go head big baby

Shit's getting real 
[Soulja Slim] 
Its the glock born shooter so respect him don't neglect him 
But check him quick to blast bullets off in your intersection 
You better ask some fucking body bout Soulja Slim I murdered them 
and I keep it cocked at all times come look at him 
I'm inviting you to danger 
You best to be a banger 
One that don't miss I'm TRU to this I' ve been raised 
blues an shit I trained myself for combatbust back as I react 
On every attack so niggaz keep your mouths closed 
And eyes open 
My trigger finger itching to be stroking 
Praying and hoping 
One of you niggaz build ya'll nuts up to come try me 
Last nigga done it bloody body 
Him couldn't get by me, why me 
A soldier that has a backround of murders and robbery 
That shit that used to be my hobby 
Never do it sloppy, make the job well done 
Get rid of the murder weapon get a new gun 
I'm on the run 
[Chorus x2] 
I'm on the run, so all you bitch niggaz leave me alone 
I'm on the run, ducking 2 shots to the dome 
[C-Murder] 
It ain't no limit to the mothafucking bitches we fuck 
My tank niggaz bout to make the world blow up 
We get rowdy in the club, so show me some love 
Its been 2 years since I possessed some drugs 
Nigga hard times is a thing of the past 
Give me 2 keys and I'm gone give you back cash 
I'm a hustle til I'm dead, ball til I fall 
I won't rest til they put my name on the wall 
TRU niggaz gone ride, playa haters gone die 
Cause after dollars and cents only the strong survive 
With bulletproof Hummers and multiple pistols 
With solid gold tanks and multiple missles 
I'ma bust until I can't bust no more 
The Magnolia, Girttown with the Calliope 
I'ma No Limit Soldier they be some soidier too 
I represent them killers cause they in my crew 
[Chorus x2] 
[Da Hound] 
I just hit the streets with my beer 
Them niggaz know what time it is 
Clear up the streets bitches put away your kids 
Shit I'm going out like a gangsta did 
Mothafuckers gotta get it how ya live 
Shit were you niggas was were you niggaz here 
Take a short vacation and niggaz struck fear 
Fuck I'm bout to break it down to the nitty gritty 
Nigga act shitty I'ma bring 'em back to the days of nitty 
Give me a Bud, pop the lid take a swig 
Give me the other bud, roll a spliff take a hit 
I gotta leave 'em how I left 'em down and out 
Running about, happy more than a smith n wesson 
I took my pistol I struck it to the ground 
I want something go buck about a 100 fucking rounds 
Plus I want the poi and fucking furl 
I'm a broke off that 11500 fuck that girl 
Shit give me the wig watch me spilt it dig 
Too many niggaz ain't pretty but this nigga is

Mac,"[C-Murder]
Niggas (what?)
Would you ride for the cause? (hell yeah!)
Would you die for the cause? (fuckin right!)
How many niggas would ride and die for you? (we riders!)

My name manifest pain to my enemies 
Holler see-Murder and bring bitches to their knees
Violent killers ready for blood marches 
Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home
ain't No Limit to the motherfucking thang, we a click
We rowdy, many niggas in the TRU click

[Chorus]
We riders
No Limit niggas
We riders 
We TRU niggas
We riders
We real niggas
We riders
We thug niggas (2X)

How many niggas want to ride and get paid
I plan to sell a hundred million records in four days
Gangstas make the world go round
But TRU niggas make gangsta shit go down
We come in your set flip your dope and get rich
Take over your block and your spot with number one hits
Money and power, ha, give me the world
Cause after dollars no cents, only time will tell
Ha, I'm goin through somethangs, fool, so stop hatin
You live for weed and money, I live for greens and bacon
And I ain't takin no shorts with my ghetto d
I stick to plan be	 and keep my eyes on my enemies
And if you want some nigga come and get some
We ride bourbans and llacs when its time to attack
So throw em up if you a real soldier
I'll make you say uhhhhh, I thought I told ya

Chorus 2X",Riders,2013
Mac,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

[Chorus x2]",Survival Of The Fittest,2013
Mac & A.K.,"[Mac]
From California to the west bay I'm on a mission
I'm untouchable with percision
Delux playa bitches rushin' to see me on GB
Game is running deeply, I'm like Silk (baby)

'Cause they want to Freak Me
I'm in the zone with my potnas, blaze a spliff and make a wish
Grab the chopper and make a hit
I ain't even trippin' though, we got more Heat then Al Pacino

Just me and my amigo forever counting see-notes
In the casino in Reno we leave them buzzing
Broke and disgusted dusted but fuck it
Peepin' all the latest G-shit 

Peep this I be gettin' around make no secret to this hall of game
When they call my name then it's all the same
The question everyone wannts to know is will a baller change?
But my Roots is running deep as Alex Haley
So when you see me give me dap and don't play me

[Mac Mall]
NIgga I sported roll before it was popular
Since grade school been a fool with the choppin' ah
Kill for cutties you couldn't see with bionoculars
Leave you in ashes or with the dirt on top of ya

Crazy like a bag of angel dust suckas don't fuck with us
I stomp you I cut you I gat slap you and tie you up
I fuck with them psychos you toy like Tyco
Your lights on I'm running through your tilt with the hype chrome

Don't ever step to Baby Capone
Boy I have your closest folks and all your family noid
See I'm a 535 never sober always high
Young pimp posted up in the high ride

Ride with them gangstas some say the Wiseguys
Wear fancy clothes but we keep them black 9's
Tomorrow gonna be the shit as long as the sun shine
And ask your bitch I'm way too saucy about mine

[Hook]
Why you want to hate me cause I'm flossy?
Ha ha ya can't because I'm way to saucy
Ain't fuckin' with you bitches that be bossy
Trying to cramp my style you need to back up off me (x2)

[A.K.]
I know why motherfuckers want to hate me cause my floss is tight
You know what the cost to bite is the loss of life
Put my mackin' in perspective, bitch it's a done deal
Keep my clique kind of selective that's how you stay protected

From you buster motherfuckers who don't know 
You ran up on a crew of motherfuckers fo' sho to let it go
Hit the strip got the bitches screamin' ""Papi""
The cops want to stop me

They want to set me up but they sloppy
I'm building up my game my hustlin' gang thang
But blow up in skrilla Cali, a must to maintain my composer
Bit the bombest spot for the doja

A 9-4-3-3 soldier, a bitch will most to the square
But I ain't got no choice but to be a player
'Cause I ain't even trying to go there
I'm gonna lay back in the cut breakin' bread with the crew

So all you niggas riding for me I'm riding for you
I thought you knew

[Mac]
Come around my way so we so we can sip E&J 
Hennessy and Coke niggas gettin' smoked in the alleyway
Them Cali days nothing but sunshine running from the one time
Still hittiin' fences, lifestyle is stupendous

Spittin' true game since wayback 
Nigga don't hate me because I'm way phat
Can't put too much on it
I'm saucy floss like Prego, from Diego to the Bay
I'm clockin' grip like Canseco

[Mac Mall]
Now must I
Tear a page of the game for them suckas
Mac & A.K. is the name a straight hustla
Got two hoes eatin' out eachother

Pimp shit and you don't ever have to wonder
At the Ramada I done stayed smokin' ganja
Yo baby mama with Double M up on her
And why'all know what Mall do work pussy like no other
When I'm threw, get blew

Mac Benford & The Woodshed All-Stars,"Casey Jones he was a mighty man
But now he's resting in the promised land
The kind of music he could understand
Was an eight wheel driver under his command

   He made the freight train boogie
   All the time
   He made the freight train boogie
   As he rolled down the line



When the fireman started ringing the bell
Everybody on the line could tell
Casey Jones was a coming to town, 
On an 8-wheel driver that was burning 'em down

there are eight more things i'd like to ride
a bicycle tricycle automobile
a fourlegged mule and a ferris wheel

This a trap
This ain't no album
This ain't no game
This a trap (trap muzik)

Welcome back to the trap
Niggas back in the trap
Wit another heavy Chevy
Big dope boys and trap
All you rap niggas role out
I trap when it's cold out
Whack niggas flying
But I stay down to I'm sold out
Cause down a hundred ground
Like a rapping in a dope house
Man wherever I be
The feds got me scoped out
Mother fucker let my nuts hang
Block out the duc canes
Cook it to it bubbles
Double fast as a mustang
I know you think you fuck man
But little shorty tuff man
Been a long time 
Since a nigg from Alanta
Spit this nuts game
That's a very few of real niggas
So how could they give nigga
The feeling that a real nigga
Would get around a real nigga
All they do is still niggas ideas
And rhythm with 'em
Holla something similar
Talking bout the hood
Like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhythms
Want em come get 'em
What bitch you pussy nigga
I'm just having fun wit 'em

[Chorus: x8]

Still telling niggas
I ain't wholing I ain't crawling 
When the 12 hit the corner
I ain't brolling I ain't rolling
Keep the coat stretch out
Like Carl Louis Hamstring
Stepped on like I'm working
With the damn thing
Dribble baby ain't seen
What I do to a ounce of doe
A whip man on my pager
Like I pay you folks
To whip some more
I'm doper than the fluid cellur
I flip it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes
So they can turn to something else
They love to work
That's why I keep em coming
Like collections plate 
We flip the cake
We move this shit from Georgia
Baby state to state
Intimidate
Niggas in the city
Who've been moving weight
Nobody loosing weight
They fuck with us
Cause you've been known to hate
Demonstrate
The way we turned the trout
Out in '98
Started out in '95
Started out with nicks and dimes
Niggas you done lost your mind
Thinking you could set up shop
Pimping I respect the game
Lets take this to another block

Pimp squad
Showty still in the trap
When I spot a scene hot
With the man name Jon
And the collard green pot
On a lot of straight hen
And a lot of green pot
Competition in a range
Like he gotta be stop
Well maybe I will be
But probably not
Oh what the blood cloak
You try to knock em out and he sock
Listen to me I'm serious
Thinking how did he not
End up way up
On the top of Detroit
If come where I was
You gotta be pop
And if you really want to pop
And I rather be dropped
Listen pops
Want to know a little more

And for chammillionaire you horrible and even worse, you similar to Jay-z's album, God gave me the GIFT, and gave you the CURSE.

Bitch I might be 
Girl he geeked up 
Bitch I might be
Yeah!

East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy til your bitch came in
Bout the same time that that thing kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinking this Buffie The Body
Ain't your name lil' Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm looking for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowing
Riding in my drop but I don't know where I'm going
On two eighty five I keep riding in a circle
The inside of my ride smelling like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes and a cold 
orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and request that I'm the man
The next thing you know I was throwing rubber bands

Is you rolling 
Bitch I might be 
Girl he geeked up 
Bitch I might be
Yeah!

Shorty telling me she ain't never suck no dick
Neva took a pill or never ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee
When them dope man Nike's and them jore ass jeans
I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
I'ma the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves that's three
Ain't no waffle house baby hell I cant eat
Gucci hood like your hood-man hes so extreme
Wearing Doces in the club cause you know the boy geeked
Top the top on that thing let you see my seats
We've been rolling rolling rolling we ain't slept in weeks

Is you rolling 
Bitch I might be 
Girl he geeked up 
Bitch I might be
Yeah!

Gucci Mane gotta lot of fame nigga get your mind right
Or a cries by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
Sell a cush by a bell so you know might shit tight
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight
I'm high like Fabo hood like Shorty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pillz that's at least bout 40
Ill pour them in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pillz call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pillz man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

Ay whats up Gucci Mane
Why you sweatin so hard? 
Is you rolling or something

Shit well baby I might be
But got damn what is you doin
You jockin' a playa, You ch-Chewy ova here right
Look I ain't K-Rab baby You know what I mean I'm not a piece of Bubblegum
What I'm doin' is not your business
But matta of fact while you ova here is you a waitress or somethin? 
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress
So do what you do aight, I'mma give you this hundred dollars
Go get you what ever you drankin
Bring me and click about ten of dem orange juices
Five crunk juices and we'll be straight how bout that
And is you straight is you single or is you marry

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves.
 
Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping;
and I just wanna bust and the teardrops fill my eyes.
And I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping; 
'cause daddies and heroes ain't supposed to cry.
The morning always seems to catch us laughing
with the baby in the bed between us, safe and warm.
And I thank the Lord above for all the good times that I'm having
wrapped up in my woman's loving arms. 
She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves.
 
And when the load gets heavy on my shoulders;
and I can't keep the pace, and I need a place to hide,
I run home to my own little world and take her in my arms,
and hold her; and I soon forget there's another world outside.
'cause she's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.

Mac Davis,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
","Whoever Finds This, I Love You",1972

And she deserves a whole lot better
Than a guitar pickin' drifter

To try and be the man she thinks I am
She makes these little kitten sounds
And trembles when I love her
Makes me feel so big and strong and mean
Whispers that she cannot wait
To be my baby's mother
She's the only glimpse of God I've ever seen
Her momma should have warned her
Never take up with a poet
'Cause a poet travels rocky roads
In search of truth and light
I'm the only blemish on her virgin soul
She don't even know it and I
Thank the Lord she's lyin' gentle 
By my side tonight",Poem for My Little Lady,1972
Mac Davis,"I could just sit around making music all day long
As long as I'm making my music ain't gonna do nobody no harm
And who knows maybe I'll come up with a song
To make people want to stop all this fussing and fighting
Long enough to sing along

I believe in music
I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in love

Music is love and love is music if you know what I mean
People who believe in music are the happiest people I've ever seen
So clap your hands and stomp your feet and shake those tambourines
Lift your voices to the sky tell me what you see.

I believe in music
I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in love

Music is the universal language, and love is the key
To peace hope and understanding, and living in harmony
So take your brother by the hand and come along with me
Lift your voices to the sky, tell me what you see

I believe in music
I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in love

Mac Davis,"Hey Mister
Where you going in such a hurry
Don't you think it's time you realized
There's a whole lot more to life than work and worry
The sweetest things in life are free
And there right before your eyes

You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way

Before you went to work this morning in the city 
Did you spent some time with your family
Did you kiss your wife and tell her that she's pretty
Did you take your children to your breast and love them tenderly

You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way

Did you ever take a walk through the forest
Stop and dream a while among the trees
Well you can look up through the leaves right straight to heaven
You can almost hear the voice of God
In each any every breeze

You got to Stop and Smell the Roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the Roses along the way

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,

Are we too blind to see,
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns

And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns

So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far

And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

As her young man dies,
On a cold and grey Chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born

Mac Davis,"I was just fifteen and out of control lost to James Dean and rock and roll
I knew down deep in my country soul that I had to get away
Hollywood was a lady in red who danced in my dreams as I tossed in bed
I knew I?d wind up in jail or dead if I have to stay
I thought happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
My mama kept calling me home but I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
So I let out one night in June stoned on the glow of the Texas moon
Humming an old Buddy Holly tune called Peggy Sue (pretty, pretty Peggy Sue)
With my favorite jeans and a cheap guitar I ran off chasing a distant star
If Buddy Holly could make it that far then I figured I could too
I thought happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
My mama kept calling me home but I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
But the Hollywood moon didn't smile the same old smile that I?d grown up with
The lady in red just wanted my last dime
And I cried myself to sleep at night too dumb to run too scared to fight
And too proud to admit it at the time
So I got me some gigs on Saturday night not much more than orchestrated fights
I?d come home drunk and I tried to write but the words came out all wrong
Hell bent and bound for a wasted youth too much gin and not enough vermouth
And no one to teach me to seek the truth before I put an end to this song
I still thought happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
My mama kept calling me home but I just could not, would not hear her
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
Well I thank God each and every day for giving me the music and the words to say
I?d never had made it any other way he was my only friend
Now I sleep a little better each night and when I look in the mirror in the morning light
The man I see was both wrong and right he's going home again
I guessed happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
But now happiness was Lubbock Texas growing nearer and dearer
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
And I think I finally know just what it means
And when I die you can bury me in Lubbock Texas in my jeans",Texas in My Rear View Mirror,1980

And who knows exactly where to kiss me when I hurt?
And who make love to me on satin sheets or in the dirt?

Who takes me home when I get too drunk to dance?
And who bravely puts up with my uncles and my aunts?
And who discreetly whispers I forgot to zip your pants?

And who comes down and bails me out when I get in a jam?
And helps me tell the police where I live and who I am?
And who pats my back when no one else could give a damn?

Meaner than a junkyard dog when she's fighting for her man?

[Da Unda Dogg] 

Whassup boy? 

[Mac Dre] 

What's happening playa  just sitting here  you know

[Mac Dre] 

Yeah  I got my niggas in here  we finna put it down 

you know what I'm saying, real, real special 

You know? Check it out, like this here 



Verse1(Mac Dre) 

As I get to bustin' 

This introduction 

Of mind corruption 

And rhyme seduction 

I steal and fill brains 

With game and mo' thangs 

Like them dope thangs 

And what that hoe brang 

Creep on Crest streets 

Speak on fresh beats 

Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets 

And wet sheets, is the end result 

Been killing long cock since ten years old 

See I blend this old-game with this new 

And ain't no telling what a bitch will do 

Now picture you 

In my position 

Steady getting sweated by the opposition 

Could you handle 

All this scandal 

And keep on stepping like boots and sandals 

My handle, is young Mac Dre 

Silky slim, is my A.K.A 

And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds 

I mean stompin' grounds 

But I like the way Rompin' sounds 

So I'ma keep it 

Romp related 

And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it 



Verse2(JT the Bigga Figga) 

Well let me jump into the pot with all the hustlers and players 

Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights 

But now I 

See my niggas at the spot with the session 

Illegal product 

Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions 

Smith and Wessons 

Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin' 

Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin' 

Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter 

Keep it on the down low 

You never tell about your scrilla 

On the reala 

I breaks it down in all directions 

It's the Fillmoe players with the O 

and the Crest connection 

All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo 

Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo 

Bought a Bolo 

Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered 

Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala 

Getting cloudy 

The laboratorys just like a porny 

Got a patient 

Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani 

Hella fetti 

We ready, steady, with all the bumbles 

Keeping it real with Dangerous Dame and Mac Mall in this fucking gumbo 

Straight paper 

Straight fetti 

Straight gumbo 



Verse3(Dangerous Dame) 

Niggas we pull 

Niggas will say so 

We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo 

Make more scrilla by the mouth piece 

Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me 

Ignore 'em like bitches 

Respect 

There ain't a hand out 

Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out 

Player hater prayer 

Praying that I buckle everyday 

Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face 

But my burners ain't feeling no flesh 

If you niggas want to test 

Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest 

You thinking deeply 

But I be on service like a shark 

Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart 

'cause love loves me 

And hate loves me 

So what the fuck you think? 

You can't fuck with me 

You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work 

But now your money's gettin' low 

While I be getting low with this wicked flow 

You got at me last night 

but I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger 

I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling ""Nothin' ass nigga"" 

My pimping ain't soft 

I'm taking no losses 

So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses? 

You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes 

And now they're spider webs 

I broke on you hoes 

I know what you're doing before you do it 

Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid 

Huh, yeah 

'Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway 

Actions speak louder 

I don't fuck with he say-she say 

Think you got game? 

Never could you have it 

You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit 

Straight trading places 

But fool this ain't no dream 

You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam 



Once again, get low for the East O 

Add a little recipe to the gumbo 



Verse4(Da Unda Dogg) 

Add me 

Mix me up 

Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up 

See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit 

So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit 

My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy 

You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly 

So back up off me 

And recognize the sound is poppin' 

Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin' 

Mother fuckers, they get to actin foul 

When they know they can't fuck with the style 

Smile punk mother fucker, sucka, hating bustas 

Ain't no friends when it comes to ends, so you can not trust us 

But trust me 

You can not dust me, or try and bust me, dumbo 

your ass gets heated in this pot of gumbo",Gumbo,1998
Mac Dre,"Chorus:
Bitch
Life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die

It's not often young niggas get a chance 
to enjoy riches in legitimate fashion
So many of us say fuck it get a bucket 
and run up in something and keep smashing
It's all about survival
but jealous rivals make it hard for us to do this
So everybody got a gun but when we was younger 
our only weapon was our two fists
Now who missed the first lesson in life don't be no punk
If you a man have heart be a savage whether you sober or drunk
I seen niggas in the pen getting 
their ass dug out over some hop or a pack of Kamels
But that's the game home boy and every move you make is a gamble
Them squares don't under stand so it takes niggas like me to explain it
I show vengeance violence and hatred because underneath it's so much pain
I ain't no sissy or punk so don't trip when  you see me crying
A nigga just hella mad his partners is dead and his folks keep on dying
My enemys feel the same way they want me dead they think I'm the nigga
that put they partner 6 feet under and left his son with no father figure
I live day by day not giving a fuck and when they ask me why 
I pause for a minute then I reply because lifes a bitch and then you die

(Chorus)

Lifes a bitch then you die nigga
don't want a whole slice just let me taste the pie
They sent me to the pen for five years
for a crime that was never committed
I ain't no bank robber but that five years
had me thinking maybe I should have did it
Do my thoughts deceive me? What a mutherfucker supposed to think 
Locked down trapped looking at four walls a toilet bowl and a sink
ain't that a bitch I've been struggling ever since I could remember
But I stay strong year round from January all the way to December
See I am a hustler I need cash bad as a fat bitch need jogging
So I specialize in three things and that's
Pimping hogging and dogging (thats right)
Half these suckers walking around here fake as three dollar bills
If you with that bullshit don't come around me
I do this for reals not for thrills
I got to watch my back for them suckers that's out to do harm
Got a tattoo of a list full a partners 
that's dead that run all the way down my arm
So If you see me mugging tripping and bugging don't stop and ask me why
A nigga just hella mad because Lifes a bitch and then you die

(Chorus)

I got a crew full of the realest that's deep as the Pittsburgh Steelers
Retired bank robbers ex-dope dealers and adversary killers
Our mission is simple get rich and stay real nigga
So our kids can live fat better then we did when we was little niggas
Life is short you only live once and ain't no telling when your leaving
So I'm going to do it all have a ball
while I'm still living and breathing
See I am a philosopher and my philosophy is this
Don't be no punk young homey if it's worth it take that risk
Anything's possible but nothings for sure
Got to take advantage of all opportunities 
and get your money you know
Love those who love you but don't never let it fuck up your vision 
How much love did your loved ones
have when you was broke or doing time in prison
Stay on your toes don't fuck with hoes before you read them
Watch your back for them rats that set niggas up to keep they freedom
It takes 365 days for the earth to spin one time 
But it only takes one minute
for that guilty verdict when that snitch drops that dime
A damn shame I thought rat heads get nothing but cheddar
But I got partners doing all day with 35 next to that letter
So I'm in trouble unless I bubble So I struggle to keep my peace
Staying money motivated with thoughts of Mike Robinson and D.J. Cee

(chorus)",Life's a Bitch,1998
Mac Dre,"Well let me introduce myself
A young go getter mind locked on havin' wealth
Livin' wild with this thug style, I got these hoes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor, 
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load 
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo,
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house
Eternal warfare with heavy weaponry
Me and my soldiers ain't scared,
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night 
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine

Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite 
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not

I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic, 
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you 
train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin', 
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes 
And air these niggas out like sandals, 
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo
And in this thuggin' category I keep it sharp as a needle
Breathe on busters and bust the tech and make it go blah blah
Funkin' with cops and duckin' the law play boy it won't stop",It Don't Stop,1999

Where am I?
I smell fire.
Who got that fire? Fire.

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm at the licker store gettin? more blunts for the skunk.
Hit the block in the chev I got thump in the trunk.
Feeling good off the wood in the hood and I'm fizz ?em.
Kind of annoyed they always trying to take a boy back to prison.

They hate to see a playa, employ yourself.
They hate to see a playa, enjoy yourself.
When I'm (side ?) want a ride, then playa lets go.
I'm 29 with many rimes and love at soul.

I'm a ho, Bust it raw with the words I serve.
Every tape I make baby learns the words.
Young Mac Dre, got to give to get.
Hate a reasy who give easy like she look at some zags.

I'm on the celli telli trying to get some roll from Nelly.
Need it very smelly, fitin to go chunk for the telli.
It's on, fitin to go blow a zone to the dome.
Tone Capone got the bong in this bomb weed song.

Fire.
Puffin' the smoke in the air. Blowin' it big like a playa playa.
Fire.
Cheech and Chong on a spree. Blowin' it big, come smoke with me.

Puffin' the smoke in the air. Blowin' it big like a playa playa.

[Verse 2: Young leech]
Every day in the life as G (Westside) we be trifling and we,
Are likely to see niggaz ain't likin' me.
Them pimped out gangsta-ism tactics,
Spinnin' all over my gun like a blacksmith.

Them bitches belligerent actor, see the chiropractor.
But I crack yeah neck, back to the scene.
Blow 'em to smithereens like the things I done seen.
In my everyday smoking out ritual, regular ooh thing.

Walking down the street with a gangsta limp and demon jeans.
Me and some squalls, and smile (bling, bling).
I just want to lean.
Why I don't chugalug this 40.

Then jump in block park homie for the block smok-ie.
With the O-G, Mac Dre, kill-a Cali parlay, parlay.
Smoking the ounce of that bomb bay every day.
Puffin' the smoke in the air. Blowin? it big like a playa playa.

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I need narcotics, that goo-e and stanky.
When I ain't got it, I'm moody and cranky.
What the dilly, what's really, what's down that filly?
We can old school with a zag, blow bags in the dilly?

Is you silly? Never throw the dubbe away.
Lace no dank when you're blowin? with Dre.
Trying to cope with this stress, so I blow big.
How can the bulletproof vest protect my wig?

See them cutthoat fools, done changed the roles.
The public got it twisted and we blame the news.
Got game for fools,
'Cause I hang with fools,

That got game to use,
And maintain the roles.
Keep it real dog, but represent what's rite.
Be a real hog when you bless the mic.

Mac Dre,"[ VERSE 1 ]
I been tryin to flip the script and take this rap thing to the next page
But the federalies got me travellin on _Con Air_ like I'm Nicholas Cage
Did 4 years, 4 months in the feds, but couldn't get no peace
Released from the belly of the beast, but the 'ralies put a nigga on a leash
The rules and regulations they inflicted, had me restricted, paroled
Kept me from blowin bomb, knowin and I'm hooked and addicted for sho'
Now how am I to be an MC when I can't get my travel on?
Can't bring no babby home, cause every morning I'm gettin sweated by Babylon
The only way out is to max out and give these fools back they lease
Fuck parole, probation, piss test and supervised release
I'ma bring a calendar, bounce, blow up like Chernobyl
Kirk out and get mobile and do this thing global
Worldwide rompin, stompin in other nations
Blowin bomb with Jamaicans, and sippin Dom with them Haitians
Kickin major flows, have Asian hoes, play the romp, maxin for 'ternity
Kick gravel, travel, see what they know about me in ???

[ CHORUS: Dubee ]
	We be global
	Touch land and that sand over the seas
	Blew off of coco leaves, releasin verbal telekinese
	For sheez, clickulate with players
	Under the stairs, to the Himalayas
	Kinda thick, layer for layer				(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Sometimes I sit and reminisce about life in '87
When I was doin my thug game, brain ten miles higher than heaven
One-track minded, blinded by the game and quick change
Not knowin across the way-way niggas were doin big thangs
And it's a shame, cause before I hit the f-e-d's
I didn't know about them niggas in Cuba and them sisters in Belize
Now I'm curious - is Belizan pussy the bomb?
When they blow, do they hum, and how quick do they come?
Boy, it's time to hit the friendly skies and fly like a seagull
Post up in spots where the pot's good and legal
Eat tacos in Mexico with cats named Flaco
And catch a red-eyed flight the same night to Morocco
Top-nacho, chasin superbad scrilla villains
Then bounce to the Philippines and get mo' head than guillotines
Boy, life ain't nothin but fat checks and head sex
So I'ma get mobile, stay global like FedEx

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I was a cell dweller, eatin Top Ramen and sardines
Now it's Taiwanese Japanese cuisine
Barefooted, fitted, sippin on sake
Blow on big hashis while I feast on teriaki
International is how I'm smashin, hoe
A cutthroat nigga that will blast and roll
I took a trip to Queens to see Jazz and Preme
They had a nigga blowin brown, said it wasn't no green
But that ain't no thang, cause in Tacoma
I blew bomb till I was in a coma
And in Seattle my partner Chilly Chill
Got that purple leaf dank that really real
I'm global, boy, I be travellin
Gettin further in the air like a javelin
Chirpitch, kirkitch, finna bounce to San Coy

Step in my shoes
Walk in my shoes
Yeah
Just want you to see things like how I see em
You know
This's for all my niggas out there
Check it out

Bottom bunk, sleepin in a 2 man cell
C.O. at my do', and I'm mad as hell
Punk police cowboy from Texas
Talkin some shit bout servin breakfast
It's 5:15, he must be psycho
Or just plain stupid for thinkin I might go
I cussed him out, he gave me distance
And pressed his body alarm for quick assistance
Now these muthafuckas want to do it the rough way
Five C.O.'s is what it takes to cuff Dre
Straight to the hole, but it ain't no thang
My celly got dank, so I'm cool & The Gang
See the lt. for the disposition
28 days commissary restriction
2 days later back on the main line
Dopefiend's dose, so I go claim mine
25 cartons, now I'm straight
Keep 17, and the homeboys 8
Cop some hop, start back boomin
Got em sendin money on the Western Union
2 fat gramms of that china white
Gon' have these dopefiends tryin to fight
Grabbed 3 cartons to coop some dank
And 5 whole packs for some hoops to drink
Now I'm chillin in my cell lookin out the window
Drinkin pruno, smokin indo
Grabbed my shank, but when I'm finsta bounce
They lock a nigga down for resistance counts
Look at Jack Brooks while I'm waitin
Might even do a little masturbatin
Trippin off that bitch Dominique
I bust one quick while my celly sleep
Doors rack open, now it's time for movement
Goddamn pruno got a nigga too bent
Bounce to the movies with my homies
The title sound good, but the shit was phoney
Damn cigarettes won't let me breathe
Niggas gettin restless, wantin to leave
The lights flash on, quick as fuck
Somebody in the bathroom just got stuck
If he makes it, he'll be lucky
Six inch blade stuck straight in gutry
25 cops rush the spot
Now I got one-time on my jock
Stash my shank underneath the seat
And make sure no blood is on my feet
Punk police want to take me down
They put me on the wall and they shake me down
Now it's back to the block strapless
But I got two mo' in my matress
One mo' time I peep the cops
Fuckin with them boys from Great Street, Watts
I said, ""Punk muthafucka, won't you leave em the hell alone""
Down to the 3rd and got on the telephone
Called my bitch, but she showed me no love
Got on the phone, shot me a cold dove
She said she can't talk, she got a sore throat
But she probably gettin fucked by a sport coat
I'm goin through it

Yeah
y'all real niggas know

Yeah muthafucka
I done been there and back boy
I could tell you the story from rags to riches
How I did time with fags and snitches

Mac Dre,"I miss you, miss you

Hello there 
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim 
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you I miss you

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

Mac Dre,"A lot of people say when they smoke weed 
It makes them feel nervous or not in control. 
Not for me. When I smoke weed I just feel good. 
You know, this one time I was in the Bay 
Hangin' out with some of my buddies, smokin' a blunt. 
Everyone's getting highfy. 
Me being the outsider I am, 
I wanna be involved to. 
So I jump in my buddies car, 
I'm ghost ridin the whip down E. 14th St, 
But he forgot to tell me he didn't have a wheel alignment.
One thing pot definitely does it makes you 
Shut the Fuck up Bitch!

Nigga I'm dangerous, A wild big blue pit, 
The type of dog you don't really wanna fool with
You get bit cause I'm dangerous 
You get bit when my homie stay sippin'

Yea

My name Daz I'm a cool what it is nigga 
Rollin with some niggas that split a niggas 
Wig I'm just chillin' up tryin' to get it popping 
Kill you about my paper if you plottin' 
Don't stop it I gives a fuck bout what you talking 
Give a fuck bout what your hopin' 
If you come for mine your body is a target 
I got some drink and a swisher full of that shit 
Hit you with this pistol I can make you hit 
A back flip you know my name you can see it in my face 
Ridin' through the streets with heater on my waist 
And the last thing I need is a case 
I keep bail money with a cool 50 K 
Just to remind ya with this pistol 
I'll blind ya leave you dead in your tracks nigga 
That's where they find ya I'm the most gangsterous 
You can think of don't be surprised I'm the nigga you hate to love

[Chorus: x2]

They took Tooky but he still lives in us he tried to say he? give? 
Schwarzenegger didn't give a fuck 
It's every man for himself 
So keep a pistol tucked, 
As far as rap goes it ain't hard to see the Crip in Us! 
A lot of nerves everybody gotta get rushed 
It's like a big picture painted by a killas brush 
Self defense be the case I'll be home for lunch 
A little drum sticky koosh and a swisher blunt 
Daddy was a ridah Moms was a wisher six dead homies 
Cause I've been that nigga I'll take your bitch 
I don't know if I'm a be back with her 
I'm hittin' niggas up every time I start spittin'
Take a peek make your whole block shiver niggas drop and roll 
With the shit I deliver I'm a Dogg Pound general 
Second in command you cross that line nigga 
Your dead where you stand you and your man Nigga

[Chorus: x2]

Now I'm back on a creep 'n real low key 
Niggas make a move Fuck an O.G. 
Niggas can't hold me I hold heat 
And the temperature don't rise slowly it's lonely 
On these cold streets Wheel it, 
Any car that's available hop out guns out, 
Naw we ain't scared of you
Yea it's true, you should see what clip bananas do, 
Run up in your crib ain't shit your man you can do.
He'll get hit through his shirt, through his vest, through his T, 
Through his chest and when I'm done with him ain't a damn thing left 
Just leekin' out his flesh 
Pourin' liquor out his vest 
And if you ask about me then the answer will be yes. Yes.

Mac Dre,"Dre rock the jewellery with the clear stones
And get on a nigga head like some earphones
I finna spit it, with a clear tone
Get yo attention
The biggest thang since the T.V. invention
Dope as Zoloft, I'm a big shot, a show off
Plus I'm a big pimp, I get tow off
Fuck a good job, she need a good jaw
To sell BJ's until her mouth get raw
I'm from the California coast, beaches and riches
Hit the cot, get ghost
I don't be sleepin' wit bitches
I got a coughnut, sittin' on wires
On Vogues bitch, not Michellin tires
Can't control my desires
I buy from Nordstroms not Fred Myers
I do a lot of weed, love my supplier
She keep it, fuck the blood out my supplier
Man I'm bigger than life, I do it Magnum
And 'bout these broke bitches, I'm through with havin' em'
Dre bogard, he shove and he push
And start war for nothin' like G.W. Bush
We be lovin' the kush, but only in the backwood
Without a backwood, it ain't all that good
I'm from the streets, where most need heat
But I slice a nigga up like some roast beef meat

I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I'll peel ya cap back, but anything else, not my job
I get ya for racks, but anything else, not my job
I make you a slap, but anything else, not my job

Bitch gone ask me to come with her to grocery shop
I told her straight up like this, ""no siree bob!""
That's not my job, I don't do that
I'm a pimp slash rapper, I thought you knew that
And where yo dude at? Should I serve em' the news
And let him know
You finna be walkin' in some brand new shoes
Ooh, you a fool, gotta watch thy self
One false move, and you could stop thy self
Sometimes I'm not myself, I'm another man
I'm a rockstar, in another band
Plus I'm the man with plan in his hands
Soon we'll all be playing in sand
Cause to my estimations, and these calculations
And all the money I made off the Rompalation
I finna get as many didgets that's on my license plate
And shit on some of these midgets bitch I can't wait

I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I peel ya cap back, but anything else, not my job
I get ya for racks, but anything else, not my job
I make you a slap, but anything else, not my job

When I dip, they trip off what Furl dressed in
Plus I got a mouth full girl's best friends
I'm a back to the future new game kind of nigga
y'all lames is plain, drinkin' the same kind of liquor
Wearin' the same kind of clothes, fuckin' the same kind of clothes
And you bedrock pimpin', meanin' yo games kind of old
You don't want it with me, I'll bother ya
So get lost pal, before I clobber ya
I got golden gloves, I give ya a new look
With a stiff left and a sharp right hook
Niggas know snitches, they ride and they go with them
It's all gravy, as long as they don't tell on them
Me and my team, see we a machine
Fuck with my mans, and I'ma have to intervene
I'ma sporco, and a sauncho

Dip, hit the strip, I take another sip, then
Kick back and count my bank, yeah, I got dank
Straight skunk, that shit that stank
So now I got my mail on, got another sale on

Fuck jail, man, I'm out on the street
Here to kickin it with the crew or with a young freak
It's Jay Tee comin cooler than most
Rhyme sayer, pipe layer from the West Coast
Where we toast, kick up and hang
No, we don't gangbang, it's just a crew thing
So you know that I'ma always be down

Once again in my 'Lac, strictly sex on my mind
Got the kind so it's time to relax and unwind
I need to get my yak on
Once I get a rock on I'm gonna throw a sack on 
So it really doesn't matter if she's thinner, if she's fatter
Than a bus, all I'm gonna do is bust nuts up in her guts
Thrust, thrust just a little more till I hit the vibration
Down on my fours, finish up my nut
I make you come through, gee
Look at my pager, it'll say 553-0461
The Vogues got the hoes just waitin in line 
TL (back to the hotel)
And after that we'll (hit another hotel)
If the bed is taken throw her on the ground
Cause yo, that's how we sling it in the V-Town

V-Town, V-Town
(Vallejo, Californ-i-a)

Now it's the V-a-double l-e-j-o
We hope you know that with a hoe
Cause yo, the players don't roll like they don't do it
But no one's gonna know that every player's been through it
So buy you some and everything'll be cool
And just to be safe, yo man, you better wear two
Cause yeah, they thick and they all look good
But they hot as a fire and they burnin like wood
In the V-Town...

Now when I say the V, I mean Vallejo
You gotta have game to stack your mail
You see the times is tough and the streets is rough
But hey, nobody said that you was put here to play
So just be a mack like me (Jay Tee)
Get signed to Rated Z and get paid correctly
I make my money, then bounce
Jump in the train with a real cold 40 ounce
Before I sleep with sluts, playin nothin but old cuts
I'm feelin on big butts
I love life, no wife, I'm just straight up mackin
The big dollars I'm stackin
The plug is on every time that I pick up the mic
I do what I feel and I say what I like
I'm on top cause you know I've always been down

(What else?) Gold pin stripes and gold tone sacks
Sick Click shit, man, that's for reala
And California lifestyle's cool, killer
Late night loungin, I'm in pursuit
Of naythin but legs open after two
So I hops in my coupe and I'm after a

Magazine Street, Hillside
Vallejo, let's side
Would you look, would you listen
I know you're sayin to yourself: E-40's missin
But man tiger, I was outside of Rated Z pissin
Comin off perved, keyed out my fuckin head
Burnt, twisted, eyes bloodshot red
On the cooch muthafuckas don't want me to let loose
We get our 'Lacs, me, Muggsy, Mac D-Shot, Lil' Bruce
The Valley-Jo, these are the things that you need to know, man
The shit I'm spittin, niggas don't understand
Speakin up for my land and all that old shit
Straight up out of Vallejo, E-40 and the Click

Yeah yeah c-3
New Orleans baby the street called eagle
And everybody's ill yea illegal
People steal cars we steal people
We eat like dogs but we're still people
And even when your lost trouble still see you
And even if your dead broke we are still equal

And just the other day my nigga Chris killed himself
I pray to god that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when theres no help
He figured heaven so he went left
Ya'll know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds come and bells ringing
(i run to trouble, trouble)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama know the drug dealers straight quit her job
He took his life and along with him I died
And she died
We died...
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me, ""daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes and see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over the 1
Still I look for better times
I run with trouble, trouble...

Just kicking back

I am carter

KnowhatI'msayin? Large co-op, what the fuck? 
To the clones, we bless the domes 
Blow the vial, you know my style, large co-op 
Freestyle all the way son 
Dice 

First of all let's talk about these ill capers 
And fly ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors 
Niggaz run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers 
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya 
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up 
Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships 
But then the bible never saved shit 
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament 
You want to slang crack, or hold tecs, and do the concept 
You can't make loot, when your moms is smokin' up the product 
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya 
The way niggaz be gettin' clapped shit'll fuckin' scare ya 
But in the dark, we ran wild, so we killin' 'em 
Niggaz scared, can't stand still, like fuckin' helium 
Fake niggaz, they don't go platinum they go aluminum 
Got em cloned the fuck up son, that's why we losin em 
I'm lookin' at this niggaz longevity 
To make a big play, but then it might be a mistake 
Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to DE 
With three p's, so when I get out, he can see me 
For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats 
The snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat 
With swollen pockets we gonna take you back home 
Master Allah Rule Savior, never clone  

Yo, I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste 
Disgrace your date put your title to waste 
Dominant lyrical grace, from a place called wild 
Illadelph Isle Pensy, that's the residency 
Consist in currency, my pockets never empty 
Some cats, believe they MC but we know they all fraud 
Do a show in Philly niggaz wouldn't applaud 
Nobody know your record nor who you openin' for 
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door 
So you should prepare, for lyrical terror that's pure 
Step up to the reservoir, of the soul proprietor style 
Messiah or, the higher law down with Dice Raw 
The matador, shorty connoisseur 
Stompin' whatever you build to the floor 
Similar to that of a dinosaur 
I told you I'm the rap predator 
You insist to imitate, what for? 
Superstar niggaz is ten percent real, ninety percent invented 
For a fuckin' record deal 
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel 
I hit you like a steel anvil 
Because you grafted off the next man's skill 
But still I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello 
Run over tactics of the 
See-L-O/N-E-S fess 
The phoniest cats is felonious (word) 

Dice Raw the juvenile lyricist corner store terrorist 
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis 
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique 
Leave a nigga shook, to the point, he won't speak 
Never half-assed, always live and direct 
On bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex 
Mad lights I had to black out, when fake niggaz act out 
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face 
All y'all niggaz is fake, tryin' to emulate my style 
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child 
I trained wack MC's, in camps like ex-marines 
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams 
Of horrifying things, that your ass never seen before? 
You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw 
Where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones 
It's not your fault black, just the fact you wasn't shown 
You'll come through this like a smurf 
I got you rollin' stop off the earth 
Represent while I been like this since birth 
And I won't be the last but I definitely was the first 
Dice Raw big car Logan's Isle sol-dier 	 

Don't come across that line or pay a cost 
Knuckle games and hammer cocked ain't nothing sweet or soft 
Win lose or draw to the jaw take one 
Deranger lyrical launcher, or station 
No conversation is needed, my task completed 
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated 
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses 
You laid on your lap, when I attack your glamorous 
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the white fowl 
My character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style 
I breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in 
Balance the talkin', that galactic style as of a falcon 
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle 
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle 
Cap you're brought up and the name of twinkle 
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggaz 
Whether small, middle-sized, or tall niggaz 
Just tie your name next when I start to X 
Givin out flex pains of death so fuck a raincheck 
The insane vet, whether you ganked the brain wet 
You proceed to lame check, the opposite of same sex 
I annihilate your type if you violate

In everything that's light and gay

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

I'm higher than your bedroom, 'bout to stick you like this tattoo
Make a move nigga, you opened them death threats
Better run and hide with your bitch, that'll see your best bet
I'm a psycho, aim for the head when the lead blow
One less nigga, one less stanky hoe
Now who can fuck with me?
The type of nigga that'll grab the gun and say you stuck with me
Got these niggaz up on the run, my bitch bust quickly
So spread out, I'm coming through - wit a pump
Mistakin' my size you best prepare for the funk

But when I do a ruthless switch them fools just don't know
I might get on my knees and break these fools on the docs
Or should I get my gat and go pull a heist
But everything is fair when a young nigga shoots it
And after all is done all the bullshit is proven
That all niggaz die no matter how much shit they might talk
I'll leave a nigga dead wit his head on the sidewalk
Cause when you in this game the shit is settled 2 rounds
So somehow rob a bank to get that dollars on
And some still ask me why I keep my gang mentality
How could I not with 23 in back a me?
At first we was a posse now we is a faculty
I'm stickin to my cutties cause I love em like a family
So when I'm in this shit you don't understand me pal
So shut it down when Mac Mall is comin versatile

Versatile many ways I do ya
I'm never ever frontin so I guess I gotta future
In this rap game a nigga gotta set his goals
And to dump me for these hoes and the ghet' for my foes
Cause niggaz ain't real and only time will tell
So I sticks to my bitch and be about my mail
I havin no time to rap about blue cheese
Just a wackish nigga in yo hood gettin G's
And shit gets sick when ya hit the dope cut
Fiends get beat down and most niggaz come up
When I was young I was told to be about yo money man
But now I'm comin up, these niggaz be actin funny man
I guess its just the jealousy they feel for me I suppose
Man its the shit that make these niggaz act like straight hoes
And you can shut it down, sit back, and think awhile
And stop playa hatin because I'm comin versatile

In 93 Mac Mall ain't trippin off these fellas
Stickin to my raps keepin these mothafuckas jealous
And fools want to know what I'ma say in the next song
Bitches on my dick cause now I gotta microphone in my hand
So now its time for Mall to get his flow on
Kick back, relax, and let this shit go on
Verse after verse I'm makin the suckas weary
And still sessin the most but playa you don't hear me
Shuttin fools down breakin em off somethin vicious

I can't lie, I like to get high and figure-8 when I drive
Blow doja rope in the sky for all my cuddies that died
We can't do nothin but strive during the struggle
You want a silver spoon in your mouth, you gotta hustle
As I take another hit of the spliff that soldiers passin
The only chance I get to feel peace, I gotta have some
So see, I spark the holla a lot, it keeps me goin
Baby boy 3 steps ahead of his death, and mama knowin
So she's sayin, ""Baby, change your ways""
But I was raised in the days of Uzis and A.K.'s
Where killers play their deadly game called the pistol-tag
Just let me live, I ask
But if you're caught in a cross, then I'ma off your ass
Young nigga that's tryin to have the better things in life
He went from crookin and rookin to jookin overnight
Some try to say he ain't right, but who's to say that he's wrong
That's why you're starvin, and the name of this song
Is get some Get Right

I tried to tell my young partner to take a look at his life
But he don't like how it's lookin, because his money ain't right
And gettin high as a kite is his way to escape the ghetto heat
In them streets where it ain't no peace
He's stayin fast on his feet, cause the rollers be chainin
And if they have you with that d, it ain't no use in explainin
Cause they gon' slam you on your face, haul you off with a case
And in the belly of the beast you're straight tucked away
But he don't hear me though, he rather sling the dope
And to that day illegal business got my folks smoked
It got me feelin like it ain't no hope for black males
If you're out there in the life it's either jail or it's hell
See, jail is what they send us to
And hell is what we're livin through
So get some get right is what you better do

Now back in 1983 we played as kids in the street
Never thought in '96 I'd roll my strip totin heat
And player, funkin with the feds was never fun to me
But man, the rollers try to take the hood from under me
Haters come with jealousy, but they ain't fadin me none
Too busy mackin bout my mail and tryin to make 21
Some of my cuddies didn't live to see the big twump-ace
And I be damned if I got out like a statistic today
So I'ma get some get right, get my game tight
Hustlin on the mic, now my name's in lights
Me and my cuddies was broke, but not no mo', mayn
They down with Cessed Out, so there's no more cocaine
Tryin to show my folks there's way mo'
To life than just bangin and hittin licks and sellin dope
Playboy, it's almost 2000, peep the game's gettin colder
And if somebody asks ya, tell em Mac Mall told ya

[ CHORUS ]",Get Right,1996
Mac Mall,"Now when I just made 12 years old
My mama told me:'Baby boy, you know you gotta be strong
And even though they lead you wrong, stay on the right track
Cause it ain't no get right without some get back.'
Yeah, I heard that, but back then I didn't feel it
Cause I was rollin' do or die, tryna see me a ticket, just kickin'
G-block, I said I'll never leave
Even when the rollers chase me down til I can't breathe
Nigga freeze, who me? Oh, never that!
I'm hittin' fence after fence until I'm chillin' at my doormat
Like a mack I had to get away
Cause I'm a smooth operator, ask Shanda
But the rollers in the V is so shady
If they could, they would plan something on me
But really, them ain't the fools I gotta worry 'bout
Cause white folks goin' loced in the white house
And I doubt a republican or democrate
Gives a fuck about us young inner city blacks
It's a trap, Uncle Sam keeps cursing me
Rather have me in the pen than the university
Yeah, it's a shame but mane, that's how it is
So ya better peep game and try to lace ya kids
Cause it ain't no tellin' what's soon to come
When the punk president might drop the bomb
Got me all stressed out with my brain on numb
My little cousin asking me where dope come from

Chorus:
They try to tell us in the verses and the scriptures
But I guess the real message must have missed us
In '96 all my brothers and my sisters
Is on a mission, we're trippin' livin' senseless
Tell me, will I see the sun in days to come
Will blacks be the victors instead of victims
Or will my people keep killing over fuckin' crumbs
Pushin' dope just to reach ghetto stardom

If you ask Mac Mall who I'm voting for
I say:'Farrakhan' as I'm hittin' the bomb
I .. to the swisher or the dohja spliff
Get elevated to another as I reminisce
About fresh candy paint and peanut butter tops
Young hustlers havin' paper, livin' top notch
And then the D-game straight decline
And all you Sawyer turf niggas makin' headlines
10 o'clock news or America's most
Unsolved mysteries, you better soak some dope
Then the judge starts droppin' the injuries
On all the gangstas, playahs, macks and G's
And you know you won't see 'em  til about 2 thou'
Cause ya boy got washed with a faulty assed trial
But at least one day he gone be free
Some soldiers ain't never gonna see the streets
That's why I keep servin' game over my beats
So all my people, in and out, can straight feel me

Chorus

There is nowhere for me to run
Nowhere for me to hide from reality
But I don't want to be a casualty
Of another tryna smother a brother just cause my salary
And dog, I tell ya that these times' so sick
That my sister's smoking dohja, 8 months pregnant
My brother bubble on the grind and he's way legit
Working on his third strike and he still won't quit
But I can't tell him nuttin' bout a salary job
So in order to get tha paper the boy gotta mob or sob
All will fall to the waistside
While the rollers overlook they want to take lifes
Youngstas they gettin' raised off the T.V.
Got white kids around the country want to be me
And the way they point the finger ain't even shob
Television replace religion, now the gangsta's god
And old folks wonder why we so crazy
90 knuckleheads and 70 high babies
And can't nobody tell me that I'm wrong
Uncle Sam finding ways to fit computer chips in my dome
So I should ask before you slip
See it's higher than the ultimate trip

Broke and disgusted dusted but fuck it
Peepin' all the latest G-shit 

Peep this I be gettin' around make no secret to this hall of game

So all you niggas riding for me I'm riding for you
I thought you knew

[Mac]
Come around my way so we so we can sip E&J 
Hennessy and Coke niggas gettin' smoked in the alleyway
Them Cali days nothing but sunshine running from the one time
Still hittiin' fences, lifestyle is stupendous

Spittin' true game since wayback 
Nigga don't hate me because I'm way phat
Can't put too much on it
I'm saucy floss like Prego, from Diego to the Bay
I'm clockin' grip like Canseco

[Mac Mall]
Now must I
Tear a page of the game for them suckas
Mac & A.K. is the name a straight hustla
Got two hoes eatin' out eachother

Pimp shit and you don't ever have to wonder
At the Ramada I done stayed smokin' ganja
Yo baby mama with Double M up on her
And why'all know what Mall do work pussy like no other
When I'm threw, get blew

Mac Mall,"Yeah ladies first so watch me set it off even the brothers can't touch us 
Professional Ballers is what they call us ain't no tellin' who we're bailin' 
Kentucky Texas ATL strikin' in a Lexus 
The nigga that want to test this 
Thought this shit was shut down thought this shit was dead like Makaveli 
Cali legends keep it goin', bout this player shit I'm knowin' 
Haters, I know you're bumpin' this shit so here's another daltz
From the Bay to the SCC, you heard us straight from California's most 

We don't need no practice, no theatrics 
Bout the way we be livin' with the Mafia tactics, I be constantly at it 
Tryin' to stack my riches like Bill Gates 
Servin' raw and uncut caine so you can't hate 
Because it angers me when niggas try to bite my ass 
But we be Professional Ballers hittin' at the top-notch ass 
Pass the green leaf on the left, inhale a breath of chronic smoke 
Exhale like a pro, I be too much for you to cope 

[Chorus: x2]
We steady countin' our money, on a mission to ball 
All the things we dream we want to see before we call 
So we pack heavy, push Chevy's, makin' the 'fetti 
If you're ready to holler at a Professional Baller 

Baby Capone on the loose, skywalk and fly shit 
Off Paraguay, Glock in the drop plus we're hidin' 
Astronauts, turnin' in shit for the soldiers that recop 
Shoot outta state pushin' killer Cali rocks 
Big wreckin' ball nuts and you can notify the monks 
I be flossin' in gators, maybe ??? ??? 
Tennis shoes, press our shit 
Aliens gank and flew, runnin' out to see you 
With the loot 

Yeah 
West Coast Mafia, bitch 
Everybody else can suck a dick 

I'm steadily tryin' to get my bail on 
Tapped me up on the cell phone, it ain't far 
Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me 
The K-I-double L-A T-A-why, call me the locster 
Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics 
Respect game, with or without these gold chains 
We're sure the West got shit sold 
From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some 
Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen 
Payin' 'em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja 
No pretendin', we're steady ballin' 

[Chorus]

From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin' chips 
My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit 
'74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip 
Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip 
Makin' moves, pushin' luxuries to ol' schools 
I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne 
And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows 
Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe 

Who keep it knockin' with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin' 
We're rockin', Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest 
Player that you spot, duck or dodge? 
It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty 
Left em deserted, heat em where their pockets hurted 
Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn 
With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz 
Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's 
With them 8-ball gangstas 
And the young mack knees and that's for sheez

O.n.s. in this mother fucker
We got the plague in this mother fucker
The pentagon in this mother fucker

[verse 1 - fatal]
Around these blocks
You know these hot glocks
Cock till you drop
All you wanna-be cops
You don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police
Beat what the streets do to me
Actin all new to me
I'll creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image
Of this primace
From here to east crems
Through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in a couther
Six plates to soup ya
On due we always cruise
Right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin with sal
I start thinkin 'bout al
Ricardi coverin my body
At the rink when I wow
I bag a hotty or two
This but a shotty for you
I got more bodies than drew
I drink mine naughty or new
Fuck your crew
This type of shit we do for a petty hobby
Fuck the whole world
This fatal dawg against everybody (it's on)
Better be twenty-five once this shit you never fuckin heard
Outlaw, outlaw, we rate these breaks
That shit we don't got be that shit we gotta take

[verse 2 - merciless x]
It's the merciless x
Like malcolm
Black as a falcon
How many shots I left depressed in your chest
I wasn't countin
But your back exploded (blaw!)
I episoded, with the weapon loaded
Let the next opponent
Get possessed with this merciless omen
The coldest crome to your dome
Sewn and holdin it's own
Let the barrel announce my ferocity
Twist spacious velocities
For haters watchin me
Make your block an atrocity
Break you down microscopic
Only doctors see, what the topic be
Drama through your armor
Bustin my two through your school of piranhas
My soldiers disapprove of your honor
We close captives, no conclusions
Let the revolver solve it
Evolve in this evolution
We shootin and pollutin

[chorus - fatal]
Pass the heat
And let me wave it in the air (air)
Guns bust, cowards fall
Niggaz just don't care (care)
To my lord I swear
We ain't never playin fair (fair)
On the streets you can't sleep
When the outlawz there
I know it's rainin on your block nigga (nigga)
You can't quit it
And you're prayin for it to stop nigga (nigga)
You shouldn't of did it
On a crash course chase of death (yeah, death)
Still thuggin on the streets (yeah)
Cause we the last ones left

[verse 3 - mac mall]
I take this thug shit seriously
Bought dirty gats with dope money
Atf can't fuck with me
My soldiers be
All there quiet
I'm holdin my crotch
Sippin henne nigga
You're life or you're not
Thug life my life
It don't stop
It's never too hot
And when I die I greet haze with glocks
Young crazy californians
Postin bout six in the mornin
On a quest to take the breath of my opponent
Them alls can't live
My cousins invite guns in they crib
Honey I'm home
Now nigga you're gone
Your bitch sing them songs
Like baritones to the rollers
When I saw her, I dumped on her
Like I supposed to
Now tell me what's funk without a mob year
And tell me what's a shrow without a witness
I only fuck with savages, soldiers, and hogs
From c.a. to n.j. mac mall be outlaws

[verse 4 - fatal]
Vocally undestructible
Your crew ain't got enough
To go clip to clip
When we shootin out on the strip
Cause I'm untouchable
I'll blast your
Chest through your back with kastro
Oh you ain't scared?
What the fuck you walkin so fast for?
Is you with me or against me
Don't run up on me and tempt me
To have your faggot ass bagged
Like a mother fuckin empty
And simply vengeance of dogs
We gets a real nigga
Let me borrow your bitch
And watch me go and chill with her
On a rise no lie
Go against me and die
Baby gated like a hive
On the side of me with a nine
Believe me
This shit makes circumstances much more devious
My murderous material
Got shorties livin mischievous
Smokin em is the easiest
The hard part is dealin with the fact
That I made it through rap
And gotta go back to killin
Cause broke niggaz be illin
Wantin money for a shoot or somethin
But you get nothin but murder when I be shootin somethin

Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket 
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it 
 
It feels good not to grind no more 
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle 
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal 
Livin' life truly successful 
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope 
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again

Puttin' it together like a racing track

Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh

A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life

Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us

Uh, uh, watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life, to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start
It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored

You on the cover of da magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toastin' wit yo' champagne, playin' life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lendin' hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin' to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine

There you have it
Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw

And chances you took and all the love that you gave
Mama made a Mac, laced me with boss game
Birth father wasn't sh..., don't even remember his face
But [Name] is a soldier, a African queen
Taught me 'bout self-respect, self-reliance, self-esteem
Told me to be a man, you stand on your own feet
Only the strong survive, streets prey on the weak
But I thought I could beat it, swore I had masterplan
Had it all mapped out till the rollers cuffed my hand
Damn, musta hurt you more than it hurt me
And me bein a knucklehead didn't make it easy
So mama, I'ma make you proud as possible
I conquer this whole world to make your dreams come true
And mother dearest, when you hear this I just want you to know
That this mama boy love ya fa sho

And you ain't trippin on the chickens that want to peck my scratch
So secure in your position, never worried of rats
The way you do your thing just can't be matched
Got me wide open, yeah baby, believe that
Imagine one day me and you jumpin the broom
I put a baby in your womb, a house in the boons
Now I ain't proposin, just statin that you the kind

She work hard nine to five, sometimes longer 

Goes to school at night, you see, she got big goals 

And I don't want to bring you down, I just want to come along 

Make you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old

As you rode up on your bike
I sat with you and held your hand
When movies made you cry
I think of all the things we did
Back when we were alive

So many things to believe in
So much room to spread our wings
The joy we found in every little thing

I never will forget the day
You heard your brother died
I'm sorry now I couldn't help more
While you sat and cried
The letters that you sent me
The summer you were gone
I couldn't wait for your return
I couldn't wait that long

Open fields we'd go to dream
All the joy we found in every little thing

Back when we were alive
When we made love I held you so close
And kissed you when you cried

Mac McAnally,"Younger men don't seem to need a purpose
They just stand and fight for anybody's cause
And older men see livin' as a circus
The ones who stand up for the longest need applause
From the young ones who proclaim to have the answers
To the questions no one ever asked before
And they cheer and have parades but when it's over
They don't claim to know the answers anymore

[Chorus]
And it's a crazy world, but I live here
And if you can hear me singin' so do you
And I'm turnin' out my night light feelin' satisfied
That there's nothin' any one of us can do
No, there's nothin' anyone of us can do

Babies cry all day sometimes for nothin'
And I have cried all day for not much more
Well it aint easy when you hate the things you're lovin'
And you wonder what or maybe who you're lovin' for
And girls seem to think that they're the chosen ones
And women choose to let well enough alone
And it's their business til you stick your nose in ones
And then you got yourself some problems of your own

Mac McAnally,"When I was a boy

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that can make me smile

Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road

Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
I asked her to marry me
She said she really wanted to

Down the road
To see what life's gonna hold
Down the road

Her momma wants to know
If I'm washed in the blood or just in the water
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

Down the road
Before he could let her go
Down the road

Now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl says
She believes that he is the only one

Down the road

Her momma wants to know
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water
And I want to know
That he makes enough to take my daughter

You know I want to help her go

One that nobody could ride

You knew he'd be there for the fight

And the next she'll be tired of you 
And push'll always come to shove you 
On that midnight rodeo 

He almost made it to the buzzer 
Somehow he gave up in the end 
He put one hand around the other 
And let that pickup man on in 
And it was his last chance to ride it 
And now he'll have to move along 
But he knows back in his mind that 
He won't be away for long 

And it's the classic contradiction

They were all laughing and all telling lies 
Then the tall one he bumped in a dollar 
He said boys I've got nothing to hide 
Now if the King and the Queen stood together 
Then the ace he would not be to blame 
And if the cards were all laid on the table 
Then love could be more than a game 

And if the stars didn't shine on the water 
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand 
And if I were the man you wanted 
I would not be the man that I am 

And I have seen my share of long nights 
And I have told my share of lies 
And I have run into the darkness 
When I saw the look in your eyes 
But if the night didn't lie in the darkness 
Then the daylight would be hard to find

Please don’t ever let the fame change you

That don't really matter, I'm a have her fall in love
I need my beauty, brains, booty, and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit
Got one night only, so make it quick
You see me out, wanna take a pic
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit
I ain't that rich, but I got bread
To make a sandwich, get me fed
Decide right now, don't got all night
This the life, so play ya cards right

So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

Can I uh, can I ignore the call
I can ignore it? Aight
I'm feelin' a lil' ill right now
And I don't mean ill like really cool and awesome
I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness

Well I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven’t slept in like five days
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend, though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a living
If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer then a Snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool

Wake up in my bed, gettin’ head, she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start
If you didn’t make mistakes, you wouldn't get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try

Ay, yo, my herb smoke tasting like a Nerds rope
I'mma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Something like a millionaire in training
Still my shit amazing, we jumpin' over puddles when it's raining
Planning on a tan, I’m in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancing on the clouds until I’m landing in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standing on the couch
But now I’m making so much money I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah I’m only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rapping twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art

High School sellin' mixtapes in the hallway
I bet they never thought I’d be this cool
Now they understand why I skipped school
Had my dreams wasn’t worried at all
That's why if I'm gettin' bored I go splurge at the mall
I got money, I got bitches
I got everything they dreamin' of and I ain't done shit yet

My bitches don't want anybody but me
They puff trees, sip liquor and suck D
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters they bring my way
I let em grill though, they can watch the money pile
While these groupie hoes try to hunt me down

Got these doubters listenin', surprised when they feel him

Rub my eyes, light some weed, send my mind on it's way
I'm gone, somewhere to my own dimension
I, show these hoes no affection
Just party every night gettin' so demented
At that time I'm lookin' in the mirror seein' no reflection
Got me wonderin', why don't they get it?
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way, the weed is twistin' you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin', gettin' paid
But my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage

Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat
If you got something to match

Baby you could wear my hat
Just twist it to the back
We drinking out the bottle while you sitting on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride
With the top down show you off to people you my prize
Nothing like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nike's
Shining like my high beams cooler than some iced tea
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shopping and you would think she worked at retail
Snapbacks make em look so cute and that girl know how to blow
Something like she played the flute
That long hair and it’s falling down her back
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can’t have this
She smiled big, kissing on my cheek
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me

She like to play her stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin’ that’s what’s up
And I hear her name’s pretty from different continent
Telling me she’s single but to tell the truth I’m not convinced
It’s all good I’m used to boyfriends always talking shit
Thinking that they players but I’m coach call me Popovich
Baby I ain’t doctor rich, but I’ll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight
And we ain’t seen her since so tell me what does that look like
I’m the type to bring you right back down to earth
And for what it’s worth I’ll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I’m guessing she a keeper

'Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And falling all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only coming through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gonna do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gonna trust you, but she gonna fuck you

She wants diamonds, she wants gold

Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she want to eat for free

I'm dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cockroach, I'm heroin cause everything I talk is dope

Tryin' to get a mansion ain't nobody here gonna find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my socks stay blue

Fool you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I've been a boss so stick around and watch it
Did the round, no college campus chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, it's just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck whose saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I'm the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I'm just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don't call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell 'em come and bring a meal in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything on factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call is Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work

Ask first, hell nah, treat 'em' like a bellhop
Let 'em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy

My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a mothafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert DeNiro
I be low, key though, Young Nino with my jeans low
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go (ahh)
You can hear the way she's moaning
Started back at midnight, had it 'til the morning
Wake up with some morning wood
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would

Go, go
You'll be fine on your own, own

She tell me, you an asshole, superficial douche bag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me
She said, I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one
I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details
'Bout how you just not happy
And you think you gotta leave so
Go, go

Mac Miller,"Everybody wanna ask where I came from
Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure what you don't want at first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words coming up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, and nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mad 'cause been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, Oh he's just so talented
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, asking what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside
No, hell no
I wanna go back home

Late night can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
'Cause it seems that I'm always on the move
When they gonna let me back home
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home",One Last Thing,2011
Mac Miller,"Hey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mofucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys

Ayo, Pennsylvania nights, nine-thirty flights
Thinking to myself, where does all this go?
No time to care, more I can share
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know, this is all I know
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit
So make a toast to the good life

Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo!
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do, probably yes
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends
Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say get some rest, when I die, I'mma sleep in

Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball

Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varying from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter
Have the music soundin' better then guitar tuners

It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing but some deja vu",Of the Soul,2011

And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah the party never ran, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe before me, then she better be a ten

Can't stop slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you were young and you just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs

You won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean, the sun is slowly fallin'
We all surely should die eventually, so what's your callin'?
Oh, you left your phone behind, identity
Crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and devil say you owe ten percent

Front page news, I'm young Jesus
Eating bagels with no cable on
Been fucking hoes since when Mase was on
I hope that Basedgod hears my prayers
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
So me and Earl smoking weed on Jay-Z's lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack
Don't hold back, no, feed your girl Cognac
Meet a bitch, sleeping wit her, feverish, diva chick
Met her off Twitter even Schindler keeps a list
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker
I could pull your bitch with a whisper and diss her
Dumbass ho
She only dumb cause she love that though
Somewhere getting high reading Juxtapoz
I hit her up she come through and watch Adjustment Bureau

Moms love me cause I'm so commercial
I fuck 'em raw cause I know they fertile

Open wide for thermometer

With a clean, faded fro, lopsided
Tell the label that I want a white driver
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga
Bold ass little fuckin' low class villian
Whole van tinted, nope can't kill him
It's the Trashwang nigga, that's what's up
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup
Real nigga from the start 'til the casket shut
Present his own case as a basket one
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge
Riding with them same niggas ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin'
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog
Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold menthol

Living like it's '62
Spit and grip my genitals
My bitch to split the swisher

Never would have thought life would end up like this
Designer clothes, seeing things the naked eye might miss
The mind it wanders, I find that its harder
To realize what the fuck it is we doing on this earth, it's a curse

Excuse me mister can I get some info
You look pretty wise and I'm, just an ignorant mind
I heard that ignorance is bliss
So it is what it is

And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud

If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me

Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war

I need a bitch that let me fuck and make me some dinner

Overall, I’m fucking bitches and there’s coke involved

Fun turns to drugs, the ideas to cash

Mac Miller,"Yeah
Do you feel it?
Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question
Rhetorical (rhetorical)

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told ""wait or me,"" the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these premadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize, take advantage of
All the time we all behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that gives you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances, for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say

I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Wherever my mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?",Aquarium,2013

Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for buttsex, it will be a cum fest
Sorry that's some shit I had to confess

Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds

Gold on my outfit
Surrounded by some pussy, I'mma drown in
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that
You know we want to know where them titties at

Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums

In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads

Like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas

Mac Miller,"People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking about her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
Never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

And mend a broken heart girl if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble can you give a hand
It seems perfection really is unattainable
Don't even say you about to end it all
Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top
And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop
And who do you call to give the coup a wash?
After every thing I did I think I'm still myself

So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed

Mac Miller,"Think I can see a fucking halo
About to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano
Some Soda for the flavor uncontrollable behavior
With some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches, he got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let them take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
I'll be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gore-tex in case of drizzle

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve a dedication to the fandom
Hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the six in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma, my look is Jay Buhner
Dawggie cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio
I been wild

Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wassabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of
My clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

Yo I'm a 635, dip or fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses I lead them to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfucking faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat

You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name say ""crack dealing trap nigga
Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker
Too fat to snap zippers""
And half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my minds first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixer
Taps slicker than past tiller
Goes around the room like his cats get finna
Oh you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Triller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from
Malcolm, I knock the thoughts off your balcony
King, you're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey row
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever
With those Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump

I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they're were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people fooling me
I'll admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish i could tell you
This life move's fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now I need to run to to any place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)

We knew nothing at all
We'd talk about the life we lived

It's a dark science, when you're friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gon' by, bye then
Can you please tell me help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lengths
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought, go ‘head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless

Fuck around and get waste dawg
Do this shit 'til the day I die
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Terrified but my hands are steady
Verify get the camera ready
Carry my own weight all these earthquakes don't wait
Need up from this sleep diving into this cold lake
Fuck all this let that hoe shake telling me I'm her soul-mate
Disguise the emotion no face bull shit with that no thanks
Dealing with her since '08 fucked around I'm done
I heard your suppose to race when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of it's fun spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logicial getting high jump off the moon
Looked right into his soul when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible when the mind is so close
Came in for your money then left with all your hoes

Open up your mind and start forgetting what you know (Oh!)

Uh love me love me then trippin' on ignore me
Beautiful to get ugly turn you into a drunky
Still searching for something but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet same shit you did last week
For all the cash you might of stood up and would've walked past me
Wake me up from this bad dream put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up can't feel myself work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio where all my problems outwear themselves
Trapped in this wish and well death creeping like sprinter cell
Getting high put my mind away find the words I'm tryna say
I'mma think of that later when the world goes against you

Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smoking, till I'm coughin' up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, still read babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of google map stars, shit
They got a app for that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head I kinda feel like its a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, what would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label think I'm black balled
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't talkin' bout some money I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity I let them go
If I was Johnny Depp in blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wylin out and being extra though
And, if god was a human it'd be yours truly
Watching horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy I'm in tune
To ancient jujitsu spirituals it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch because I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now it's just not the same
I'm looking out the window ashing on the pane I wonder if I lost my way

Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face
Shit, that god fellow may reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin'
Dreamin' of places my own personal creations

I burn a city down while I'm unconscious, baby go on
Take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesus
Batting practice with the motherfucking ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target

I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, ""Fuck the world kid, just do what you like""

My milk and honey, my Cherie-Cherie Amour
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the wicked witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still,
How Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother
Real, her face was care-worn
I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch from the very beginning of Year One
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell ""Hear, Hear,"" finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant,
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent

All of these hugs and kissy emojis killin' my foe, G

Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest

You ain't gotta cry no more

It'll be alright
My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight it's like
When it all goes up in flames who gon hold me down
And I'm the chosen one
Looking all around what has the world become
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground

About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown

You've never been better than me

I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly

It's the life of an entertainer
I need that check go on get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor

We were trying to change the world but we got bored

Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies the top so lonely but
We're not gonna die not now

You'll make it here, live free tonight till the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile
How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now
Go on and on, know I had this shit all along

I came for whoever is in charge
I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard
They need some coffee, everybody’s sleeping on me
Going around door to door, setting off alarms
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (no emergency)
I moved up from a Private to a Sargent
You can see it in the scar face
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil with me and he tell me to shoot

Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday
Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay
Bra’s a baton, pass it off like relay
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?
She say “I thought you got sober”
And I say “I wish you’d stop being a bitch
And get to minding your business”
Told me “Money has changed you”
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?
How’d I get so egotistical? I’m a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I’m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all

My mother raised me a God (Hey)

(Fuck you)
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up
(Fuck you)
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye (Fuck you)
I am a sinner, I’m just tryna sin
Warm in the winter, and I’ll be on my way
I’m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

Oh yeah, I thought I’d have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past right now
Me and the homies would be sitting on millions
Reminiscing when we were so broke and living in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kicking back by now
I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch
I thought we’d put her in a cab by now
But I’m stressing, I can’t relax
I swallow my pride and I’m higher than what’s making me mad
Everybody say I need rehab
Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long ‘til they watching me crash
And they don’t wanna see that
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Telling her they could have done more to help me
And she’ll be crying saying that she’ll do anything to have me back
All the nights I’m losing sleep, it was all a dream
There was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbing them dark times
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up
It’s a problem, I need a wake up
Before one morning I don’t wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I’m too obsessed with going down as a great one
And if you wait too long, they go find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain’t already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me time I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there’s a place
Where all my people free and everybody straight
Every devil don’t got horns, and every hero ain't got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, Good morning
Yeah, good morning",Perfect Circle/God Speed,2015
Mac Miller,"Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing
Just wanna ask a question umm, have you
have you, have you been in love before

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
'Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you
I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you
Through sunshine or rain

(I love you)

Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids
And though pilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

Your love is not too kind to me
Yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

And she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one when I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention, I
Want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to, there can't be two
You was here I ran from you
Scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not
You up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you, I'm

Too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting

Your love is not too kind to me
Yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

So gimme all your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine

Mac Miller,"I give a fuck less and less everyday
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate
Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war, this N64 Blitz champion (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich

The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers
Now it's Rush Hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker
I stuck around the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich

The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the baby face don dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
You know what I'm talking about
Don't ever become content, because you will repent
You feel that, go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will",Rush Hour,2015
Mac Miller,"Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories. Mac miller, I love you

All of my homies used to get on my case like ""when you 'bout kill 'em?""
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these Nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man, my mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches can still can fuck my hologram, god damn

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive

You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it

You can expect the unexpected
These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless, with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' ""I'm the man""
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the clear as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even thought I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride

I'm goin' up before I skydive

Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

Hey, blow out the candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

In my life time, my whole M.O. was to get this M.O.N.E.Y
I sabotage the wealthy and the rich and the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say Soulo, you so crazy and deranged
I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most dope, Top Dawg off the leash, Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo)
Our Anarchy is our NR key
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia

In this life time, be the time of your life
It's been a while, but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on
And eatin' swordfish, from gigantic portions
Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
What a fine act you got for
I don't know why I get so high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time

And you got people in the aisle
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you, just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
This the type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a fresh group second and a third time, left you up a verse mind
And when you hungry I can shut you up with stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate this third eye

Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

We went straight into the room
And played the music and started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved onto the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight

Love
Love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love (sex)

This one don't frown when I'm the wrong
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you
Girl I'm so in love with you

Yeah, yeah

Baby you were everything I ever wanted
Bottle, wedding ring it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away
So I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
I was on the phone, we ain't no talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh
I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargin
Mr. Charmin' that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hemp for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""all you ever think about is sex""
I'm like oh well
You know me so well
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail
Well I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

Take your time my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But yes I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with me run away
All I ever know is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you

Hello I would like to tell you about my love affair
With my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other
And find out about each other
We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building
And he would help me with things and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy""
And he was a cute guy
And it was just little by little we got to know
Just to say hello
One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him
People respected him, and he was good to everybody
He knew people he worked with all adored him
And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody
For me was the most important
Being attracted to him and being, finding people respected him and I respected him
I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were
And I learned to understand and respect
And see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
So it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together
And our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other
And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other
After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding
With just family and very close friends
The friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys
And, my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
And I feel I just gave him a wonderful life
A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other","God Is Fair, Sexy, Nasty",2016

Left his six figure job for a mission position

As we watch the sun rise we can say

Mercy is true, it's hard to live with the things I do

So God bruise the heels we've dug in the ground
That we might move closer to love
Pull out the roots we've dug in so deep
Finish what You've started
Help us to believe

Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)

We can't go on, seems this conversation's done
It's so hard to win these fights and love You at the same time
So take my hand 'til grace makes a way to bend
'Til the things I said to ruin only lead to my own end

So God bruise the heels we've dug in the ground
That we might move closer to love
Pull out the roots we've dug in so deep
Finish what You've started
Help us to believe

Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open

Draw us in, send us out
Draw us in, send us out
Draw us in, pull us out
Help us to (believe)

Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open
(Love is kind and love is daring everything we need to keep our eyes)
Keep our eyes wide open

I look around me,
But all I seem to see,
Is people going no where,

Of a scripted destiny.

If life won't wait,
I guess it's up to me.

Woah!

Won't look back,
When I say goodbye.
I'm gonna leave this a hole behind me,
Gonna take what's mine tonight.

You're gonna wake up feeling sorry,
Because life won't wait,

Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
Ok je pense qu'il est temps que tu dégages
Ou c'est moi qui fais mes bagages et qui m'arrache oh la la
Ça déménage dans le ménage
C'est la guéguerre des roses dans l'appart
De part et d'autre personne n'admet ses torts
On se dispute tous les jours sans jamais parler de divorce
Aucun mariage forcé, que de l'amour pur
Quand t'es en mode effort les femmes veulent toujours plus
Tu m'insultes comme si j'étais le pire des salauds
Tu sais que je te trouve belle comme la femme d'un autre
Marre de te laisser gueuler sans dire un mot
J'ai peur de te retrouver dans les bras d'un autre
Putain mais qu'elles sont folles ces femmes
D'avoir brûlé leurs soutifs ça leur monte au crâne
Tujours vénères comme si elles avaient leurs règles
Donc cesse de te leurrer l'heure est au réglement de comptes

T'es qu'un fils de pute tu me fais de la peine
Tu t'es pris pour Brad Pitt mais tu n'es que de la merde
Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
Tu repasses aucune de mes sapes, la même bouffe tous les jours
Dehors toute la journée tu n'attends que mon retour
Non pour faire l'amour mais plutôt faire la guerre
C'est un enfer de ouf quand ma fouffe me prend la tête
Griffe devant la porte, clé dans la serrure
Ouvre-moi bébé désolé d'avoir fait le dur
Là ça fait le canard pour calmer le carnage
Je m'excuse sans savoir pourquoi j'ai perdu la face
Je me sens plus le même devant le miroir
C'est qui l'homme ici ? Elle ou moi ?
Quelle question bizarre
2006 elles nous maquent c'est pas très bon ça
Bientôt les mcs mettront des strings et les meufs des calbars
Festival de cris nocturnes irruption de larmes volcaniques
Sinon c'est la drogue dure ce que l'amour nous procure
C'est de la haine et de l'attention, c'est de la peine et de la passion

T'es qu'un fils de pute tu me fais de la peine
Tu t'es pris pour Brad Pitt mais tu n'es que de la merde
Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
Ya qu'au lit qu'on trouve le temps de parler à nos femmes
Sinon le reste du temps frère, nous sommes à nos armes
Je ne veux pas être un clochard qui n'assume pas ses charges
C'est dans la dispute que l'maour perd de son charme
On a peut-être du mal à rompre quand on ne s'aime plus
Les femmes savent bien qu'un homme c'est pas né dans l'habitude
Putain on va tout de même pas gâcher toute cette année
La vie en couple c'est pouvoir dialoguer sans se fâcher
Mais tu sais que je t'aime, c'est ça, c'est ça
Tu sais que jamais je ne pourrai vivre sans toi

Qui saignent et qui s'embrassent qui cèdent de belles histoires

- Non mais, hé, chérie, là, j'ai pris la peine de t'expliquer,
là tu vas me faire péter un boulon et après faudra pas t'étonner hein?

Universal pose les billes, moi je reste vrai
Le showbiz c'est rien pour moi, j'ai l'appétit de Shrek
Dans une cellule de prison à peine plus grande qu'un cercueil
Tu réfléchis sur ta vie pour savoir où ranger ton gun
Le cœur blessé, t'avances quand même sans goûter
Si j'prends l'roro la concurrence dans l'rap sera goute-dé
Plus jamais personne pourra me doubler, plus jamais l'oubli
J'ai pas pu voir ma fille jouer à la poupée
J'suis une caillera, une vraie, j'assume mes actes poto
Plus besoin d'expliquer la définition du logo (Untouchable)
Du mal à accepter qu'une femme puisse s'occuper de moi
Toujours un truc chelou qui me chahute comme le diable
Toujours la vision, toujours la niaque
Comme Underwood j'trouve le pouvoir aphrodisiaque
J'rêve de repos sur une île paradisiaque
Peur de crever dans les bouchons d'une crise cardiaque
Microphone check, vérités sur un boom tchack
J'suis la persévérance qu'attendait le miracle
Quand l'oseille se fait rare, nos actes sont répréhensibles
J'ai passé le 31 décembre tout seul avec mon inspi'
J'ai pas d'amis, très peu d'messages de Bonne Année
Le désespoir est les couloir des cités abandonnées
Toujours ce flow d'vérités difficiles à entendre
Sache que le temps est trop speed pour nous attendre
C'qui fait de moi l'incompris, l'incompétent, l'insolent
Faudrait qu'le temps me rattrape pour que tu puisses voir mon talent
Regarde-moi, regarde-moi
La persévérance a pris exemple sur moi
Regarde-moi, regarde-moi
La persévérance a pris exemple sur moi

El General, chico
Je remercie le Tandematique
Xplosif Click, et toute la street, négro
On a été boycottés pendant quinze ans
On s'est battus, on a sortis des disques, on a fait d'l'indépendant
Mais jamais ça voulait passer un cap
Moi j'suis pas juste un rappeur, j'suis un artiste
J'ai toujours été avant-gardiste, j'ai toujours ramené les choses
La porte des étoiles tu connais?
Et c'est moi qu'on double
Maintenant, j'remercie Monstre Marin, j'remercie Gims
Il s'est mouillé pour la tête brûlée gros, il s'est mouillé
Ceux qu'insultent, j'les baise frère
L'rap français c'est tous des merdes
Ils sont là, ils sont en train d'se parler les uns sur les autres
Personne pour s'entraider
Y'a MMC qu'a proposé au Général de reprendre sa place de Général
Le rap c'est moi, le neuf-trois c'est moi
Et la rue, c'est moi, bande de bâtards
El General, chico, c'est que l'début
On est encore loin d'la fin de carrière
Y'a des classiques qu'arrivent encore
Pour moi c'est normal, c'est dans mon sang, c'est dans mes veines
J'ai mis tout mon vécu d'la rue dans la cabine de prise poto, rien d'autre
On a décidé d'être un rappeur aujourd'hui
On a levé l'pied sur ce que, pas trop envie d'parler wAllah
Eh dis-leur Kickos wAllah ils m'traumatisent wAllah
On va les baiser leur mère
Bande de bâtards va
Les rappeurs qui faisaient les thos-my
""Eh So' on t'aime bien, on t'aime bien""
Mais vous savez qu'dans l'business j'étais bloqué
Maintenant j'vous baise bande de bâtards
Y'a pas d'feat dans mon album, j'vous baise
Mon studio il est dans ma cité frère, c'est tout ce que j'ai à dire
Je suis une légende, oui oui",Outro,2006
Mac Tyer,"PAIRE DE REQUINS
Mes requins trainent au studio, mes requins trainent au quartier.
Elles aiment marcher sur les Champs-Élysées.
Engraissent les potes du portier pour une soirée mondaine
À la tess la paire de requins est sur un compet
Pour un contact avec pour une affaire avec des air-force 1
Mes requins n'ont rien d'une paire de westons
Donc elle perd son calme
Quand elle est neuve elle en jette
C'est vrai qu'elle est re-chè mais ca fait plaisir à la p'tite soeur en survet
C'est avec son lacet que le tox fait son garot
À staro elle est toujours au pied d'un accusé dans le box
Usée même cherté on la porte fière d'elle
Mes requins risquent 16 mecs alertent parfois toute les semaines
Echappe parfois aux soins intensifs elle ne passe pas aux aveux
Mes requins avancent avec la grâce de Dieu
Son pire ennemi c'est la chaussure étoilée symbole de l'éternel conflit de la Palestine
Elle est partout, vieille ferraille, gamos également box
Partout parloir café hall dans ta cité
C'est là-bas qu'elle a trouvé sa rage entourée de 180 air max et de u arash
De-spi branchée sur 100.000 volts,
Qu'il pleuve ou qu'il vente la paire de requins vend sa drogue
Frelon, son meilleur poto c la paire de shox requins,
Parce qu'un l'homme est un prédateur pour l'homme
Refrain (x2)
Un grand doigt de vérité sur la paire de air max requin,
C'est celle-là qu'on porte (aime) parce qu'elle coûte chère et qu'elle nous va bien
On vient d'en bas gros et ça tu le vois bien
En caillera dans ma paire de requins
Hé ouais c'est la paire de requin mon pote, même moi je la porte
Celle-ci je la cace-dédi a tous les frères du bon-char
Les requins sont dans les vitrines à nous faire des facies
Elles sont dans les chichas et les cabarets
Piétinent une cigarette dans un bar à you-voi
Mes requins accélèrent les voitures pé-ta
Attirent les motards sur une bécane
Abusent pour nourrir les grosses chiennes aux grandes bottes
La paire de requins c'est les p'tits jeunes et les sistes-gro qui la portent
N'insiste pas trop t'auras les kiss-dé sur écoute
Les requins se privent l'hiver pour aller frimer sur la côte
Comment ça on me dit y a des falches du Maroc
Mes requins sont frais parce qu'elle coûtent grave des euros
Si tes requins trafiquent et qu'elles sont en semi
Attache fort tes lacets pour le jour où tu devras courir
C'est pour les courageux requins noirs virgule argentée
Celles qui font les p le soir pour une nouvelle paire de jantes
Quand c'est chaud mes requins sautent par la fenêtre marchent dans la boue
Pour vè-ski la maison d'arrêt
Mais rien ne l'arrête, mes requins s'en battent les reins
Fait le bonheur des nouveau-nés comme des assassins
En gard'av elles servent de coussin le sommeil profond
Ma paire de requin est libérée sous caution
Elle ne se chie pas dessus même face à 12.000 paires
Sartek cousin si tes requins ont foulé le sol de La Mecque
C'est une classique paire pour les caïds
Et si tu veux faire plaisir c'est un bon cadeau
Refrain (x2)
Un grand doigt de vérité sur la paire de air max requin,
C'est celle-là qu'on porte (aime) parce qu'elle coûte chère et qu'elle nous va bien

Aucun élément à charge mais la juge n’en a rien à faire

Qui aurait fait une carrière si longue que la mienne
Sans avoir de trophée?

Je trouve ça érotique

Mais la misère est un ras-de-marée
Qui expliquera cette rafale le jour de ton mariage
Caché derrière tes gosses pour pas t'faire fumer

Envie de les régler à coups d'batte

I Wonder Where You Are Tonight

 
  
Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary
Wondering if I'm wrong or right
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight

   The rain is cold and slowly falling
   Upon my window pane tonight
   And though your love seems even colder
   I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared

Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight

Thinking of you, feeling so blue 
Wondering why you left me behind

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie
Where we sat in the long, long ago.
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill is still, Maggie
Since you and I were young.

A city so silent and lone, Maggie
Where the young and the gay and the best
In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie
Have each found a place of rest
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie
And join in the songs that were sung
For we sang just as gay as they, Maggie
When you and I were young.

They say I am feeble with age, Maggie
My steps are less sprightly than then
My face is a well written page, Maggie
But time alone was the pen.
They say we are aged and grey, Maggie
As spray by the white breakers flung
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
When you and I were young.

Mac Wiseman,"I wandered today to the hill, Maggie
To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie
Where we sat in the long, long ago.
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill is still, Maggie
Since you and I were young.

A city so silent and lone, Maggie
Where the young and the gay and the best
In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie
Have each found a place of rest
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie
And join in the songs that were sung
For we sang just as gay as they, Maggie
When you and I were young.

They say I am feeble with age, Maggie
My steps are less sprightly than then
My face is a well written page, Maggie
But time alone was the pen.
They say we are aged and grey, Maggie
As spray by the white breakers flung
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
When you and I were young.

And now we are aged and grey, Maggie

If your new romance turns out a failure
Here's where to find me my dear

Right next to the heartbreak hotel
In a tavern that's known as three tear drops

I'll tell you all my troubles in an awful dream I had
I dreamed I was a prisoner, my life I could not save
I cried ""oh, must I perish within this silent cave""

The rescue party labored, they worked both night and day
To move the mighty barrier that stood within their way
To rescue Floyd Collins, it was their battle cry
""We'll never, no we'll never, let Floyd Collins die""

But on that fateful morning, the sun rose in the sky
The workers still were busy, ""we'll save him by and by""
But oh how sad the ending, his life could not be saved

I said, well, I didn’t know
He said, “I turned 65 about 11 months ago”

When this old gray black gentleman was cleaning up the lounge

There wasn’t anyone around except this old man and me

Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
“Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?” he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn’t answer back
Ain’t but three things in this world that’s worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine

He said, women think about they-selves, when menfolk ain’t around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you’re down
He said, I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now its old dogs and children and watermelon wine

Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they’re still too young to hate

En el mundo entero crece la voz en el mundo entero caiga la pena debajo al suelo

En el tramo del camino que junta lo bueno y lo malo
Donde se rompen los destinos y se separan las manos
Donde nadie recuerda que fuimos hermanos
Por eso yo canto hoy,
Mi mal espanto y voy en un mundo que esta loco unos crecen
Poco a poco en un mundo que esta loco hay quien no crece

L'elettricità eccita tutte le luci da città a città
Per una lucciola c'è chi riduce la velocità chissà
Che escogita mha! C'è chi vomita l'anima in un bar
Che si illumina come un coshar

Che ha trovato una cicca di Pall Mall
E se l'accende davanti ad una banca
Fari di una macchina che sosta in fondo
Quanto costa un condom?

Quanto costa il mondo
Sotto gli spot puntati sui viaggi in Congo?
Quanto costa un sogno?
Nulla sulla panchina che mi culla come nel vientre
Di una bolla che valla mentre vado su!

Sácate la careta y ve, ve, vente paca
Que esta noche chico no hay excusa
De roncones saldrán ritmos que fusionan
Mentalidades in a one connection

Vayan donde vayan
Vengan de donde vengan
Lo que nos unió no nos lo quitarán

And I wish I had a dime for every bill I've got to pay
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in
So I jump back in there where I learned to swim
Try to keep my head above it the best I can, that's why

You got a little work or twenty to lend
I opened up my hand he said ""I'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends, you see""

With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends

And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet

And every single soul needs a little releasing

Macaco,"Soy semilla, I my seed
Soy semilla

Carne adulterada, plastificada
Fruta a tintada, con sabor a nada bien hinchada
La bruma de la noche, es gas por la mañana
La primavera se confunde, el invierno engaña

El calor de enero, no abriga nada el alma
Olores envasados, flores al siquiatra
El gato no maúlla, el bosque se calla
El perro clonado que no ladra

La luna duerme inquieta, la tierra violada
Exilio al campesino, la huella vacía que todo lo mata
La cola entre las piernas, la planta tumbada
La abeja suicida con miel en las alas

Fabricas de hielo, paisajes al destierro
Cuando la muerte venga a visitarme
No habrá tierra donde enterrarme
No

Ven, semilla de tierra salva mi ve
Santa alegría para nuestra flor
Ven, semilla de vida salva mi ve
No más semillas vacías

Flores que se clavan en sin floreros
Campos sin agujeros, el pan sin cada día
Las verdades en los huesos, abrochen cinturones
Turbulencias en los cuerpos

La duda no existe en su cuaderno que vuelo
Insomnio del respeto, el miedo entre su manos
La puesta al sol, ellos la han ganado
La manzana no se pudre, estaciones de diez meses

Sin grados en diciembre, la piel de la tierra escuece
ácido en el suelo, el aire sabe a fuego

Si tu eres mi casa
Por que mi paso se retrasa
Y a veces no sabe volver
Dime mi niña
Si tu eres mi espejo
Por que aveces mi reflejo
No se asoma, no se deja ver

Serán mis melodías
Que confirman mis heridas
Será mi voz
Que camina de puntillas

Será tu mirada secreta
Que seduce a tu dueño
Sera tu historia y la mía
Que vuelan tras un mismo sueño

Volar, volar
Subir bajar contigo
Sin alas volar
Volar, volar
Subir bajar contigo
Sin alas volar

Soy el esclavo de tu sombra
La orilla de tu boca
Tu dolor, tu medicina
El que te espía tras la cortina

Soy el riesgo de un trapecio
La penitencia y la fe
Una diana sin acierto
Un laberinto sin pared

Te regale la luna
Me sumerjo en tu laguna
Buscando la vacuna
Que me devuelva la fortuna
De volar junto a ti

Volar, volar
Subir bajar contigo
Sin alas volar
Volar, volar
Subir bajar contigo

Tan solo yo me puedo salvar
Tan solo yo me puedo curar

Pero que nunca cambie la meta de juntos volar

And started it flashing from its head to its toes
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew
A new love was born and the violet turned blue

If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets I'm blue as can be

A flower that's wild they say has no home

You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,

When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I'm not gonna raise a fuss
But before you make another move
Let's start by taking care of us

I don't want nobody
To give me nothing
Open up the door
I'll get it myself

Kids, get that education
And don't you take no more
'Cause if we gonna get
This thing together
Then you got to carry the ball

I don't want nobody
To give me nothing
Open up the door, open
Open up the door

Open up the door, hit it
Open up, here I come
Open up and let a man come in
Open up, let a man come in
Open up, let a man come in

I'm comin' in any type of weather
Comin' 'cause I got myself together

Mach-Hommy,"(""Sell me this pen"")

Run through the wringer with my bros
Can’t even count the years in this game on my fingers and my toes
I don’t get open dancing on stage, I bring it to a close
Make a sandwich out of my knuckles and bring it to your nose
Mink black, the link Turkish
I wasn’t randomly selected, I was chose to serve a purpose
On many levels, you still scratching the surface
Machine’s working, I’m wrapping packages for purchase
Speed in a German auto, not with the frivolous convo
I’m in a drop rocking a hooded poncho
Talking out your ass, something I put my foot in pronto
Not the GOAT, but the way I float, it got my name put in the convo
Codename: Spy Hunter, I’m fly for the summer
Pockets thick like 22 plied lumber
Make a spectacle, observe me while I’m doing my numbers
Fadeaways with the tongue out when I’m shooting my jumpers

Fuck, bigger picture, if I rhyme, it’s just coincidence
These are God’s words given to my brain on top of instruments
Filtered through a brush, so when I paint it’s never settling
It’s reggae roots, rock, or watch Roots rock “Adrenaline”
Fuck the rhetoric of any lies attached to me
Assassinate my character with rumors and the blasphemy
Truth’s crushed to the earth and then it rises
While the working late doctor working late with no surprises
I sell ‘em stories, I don’t tell ‘em the end
Only person in this building who could sell ‘em this pen
(Sell me this pen) Say it slow one time and never say it again
‘Cause your day might, and you never know when
This my shot, no chase
Either get briefed to the Evidence or there ain’t no case
Still rock it off my hand so there ain’t no trace
I’ve been around the planet but there ain’t no place

Make sure the shit is for real, the woodgrain is Stradivari, Venice Chenille
We'll push caine to cash and carry, niggas was ill
Make sure the visit was healed
I put pain in every pad, we been in appeal
My bookbag was axillary, niggas could tell
Wrist is concealed, riches on top of riches, membership dues
We owe a lot of niggas venison til
Kind of fit link is from Nigerian grills
I keep a plantain in back of the coupe
Bullets ta-ting like the grand wizard, spit a thing at your canoot
Chewing tobacco, raw lavish is loose
Bullets for Babylon, babbling rules
365 donts, 249 patented moves
Food la bouche, it’s maize in your mouth with horse radish and goose
The poor house is salt, crackers, and soup
I’m Munchausen on rappers for juice—where is your proof?
Like you could fuck with all of that in the booth
I put professors on sabbatical too
I put some ketchup on a rapper, little peppercorn ranch and it’s ""Mmm""
My bishop ran up on your castle in slough, Ravishing Rude
Some eucharist was on his hat in a cube
The hat flew, his ex let out the crack for fast food

But it seems like a thousand years since I've been gone
Oh, what I'd give to hold you in my arms
Can't you see how much I need you tonight
I'm going crazy girl, can't get you off of my mind

You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go... I get that feeling
It's hard to be so far apart
When thoughts of you keep coming on so strong
I picture you in every face I see
Now I know I left a part of me back home with you
There's nothing like falling for the very first time
I won't forget you girl, for the rest of my life
Everyday that I live without you

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Everything I'm feelin' when I'm with you

I know you feel it too, so
Baby don't ya get all coy with me
'cause I know that you like this boy you see
As much as you ignore it won't go away

'cause baby nothing ever felt so right
I ain't gonna leave until you're mine

'cause I see it in your eyes
And I can tell you're excited, 'cause
You know I'm gon getcha!!!
Girl, this feeling can't go unheard
Won't stop till you're in my world
And baby I just can't hide it
You know I'm gon getcha!!!

Never been the kind to tolerate playin' games
It's just when I see two people feelin' the da same
It doesn't take a scientist to explain
You gotta get up, get up, get movin'

So baby tell me what you gonna do
'cause what you feel for me I feel for you
As much as you ignore it won't go away

I ain't gotta read between the lines
'cause baby nothing ever felt so right

Confusion is nothing new

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

And you will find me, time after time

Uh, uh, yeah, staring out into the unknown
Voices in the wind telling me to come home, but I’m scared
Scared that all this time I’ve been gone 
I’ll open up the door and my little daughter will be grown
And I’m cold, tell me why I’m so cold?
Probably 'cause a shoulder turns every night that I’m on the road
Probably why I can’t smile every time that I’m on the phone
And why I’m acting so wild every time that I’m alone
Save me! I suffocate myself inside the bed
Trying to cut the circulation of these thoughts inside my head like
“Do I hate me? or do I hate them?” 
Either way I’ve held grudges since I was holding a pen
My father had me thinking my cousin was dead just to hide me from the truth
How can I look at him again?

And everything you said today couldn’t be undone?
Cause’ all it takes is a bullet from one gun
To take another’s moment away from their one love I know
See I was just an only child growing up
Just frowns 'cause I never seen a smile growing up
But you? You were a friend, always down growing up
Give the word, know you would’ve blown trial growing up
Fuck! How could we let all this petty shit blind us?
How the fuck did we let the devil find us?
See, we were supposed to be best friends 'til the end, you promised!
How’d it take that fucking night to remind us?
I only said I hated you 'cause you're the only one that’s ever honest
Man I said I was wrong, let’s get beyond this! But it’s crazy
Cause I never thought my text apologizing
Would be the reason that you died driving

I wake up screaming in my sleep every fucking night
Open up my eyes to cold sweat, bloody clothes from my nose, ech
Nothing nice, Father I’ve killed a man, but I had to do it
Only thing is ‘he’ is me, damn, how the fuck you couldn’t get me through this?!
My skin is bluish, voices in my head saying
“Don’t be stupid all you have is in that bag you better use it!”
Cut it, snuff it, puff it, shoot it, 
only one I trust now is myself these muthafucka’s Judas
Gun in my pillow 'cause all I feel is this paranoia
Holes in my wall from all them nights that I was feeling for him
The devils here but I’m still awake, then I broke the mirror
Why? Cause I seen his face, even my bitch corrupted
I fucked her pussy until it's bloody
took it out and then she sucked it told me that she loved it, Bitch
Everything is black I think I am deceased
I am a ghost without the bed sheets, X speak

If a beast is what I got to be, then so be it
Fuck it, if I got to live it, then y'all gon' see it
Eat it, Shit it, Live it, it’s in my blood
That’s why I get down like 'What?' from the dirt to the mud
You fucked up thinking shit was sweet, but shit in the streets

make you spit teeth only love ones grieve

Ain’t right, if a nigga can’t still feel the pain
But still kill the game, still keep real and aim

Let a nigga know, if we going to walk this dog
Or If we ain’t gon' talk at all
Make a nigga have to, talk with the 4
That's the only language you know
There you go pop, pop, pop, Now there you go
And I hate that I can see snakes clearly
They don’t even try to hide, it’s like they be tryin' to get near me
Most of y'all don’t hear me, it’s like I’m talking to myself
You niggas is so dumb got me feelin' like I’m talking for my health
It’s not like I’m talking for the wealth 
'Cause there ain’t no money in the truth
Shit! I live this shit for real
Y'all make it up in the booth
Till a nigga lose his tooth over something he didn’t plan on
Wasn’t prepared for, really couldn’t stand on

Fuck it, turn the cam on, tie his feet and his hands up and watch him
I’ll be back up with that heat to get his tan on
Now that’s for fucking with me
And that’s for my dog
This because where you're going you're not gonna need that arm
The street’s is talking, Uh oh, here they come
Thirsty for that blood, Red rum, red rum
Do you know how it feels to be so mad you would kill?
Or to be so trapped when you scream your throat cuts like jagged pills?
And whenever you close your eyes everything inside you dies
And all the ‘high’s, crimes, and lies’ come alive muthafucka

Machine Gun Kelly,"I'm humble because I know what it feels like
To be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me

I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around now I'm somebody

Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me cause I'm nothing like 'em, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he’s proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated
When inspiration, motivation was needed
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'ma keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listen in to witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirlin'
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

Doing whatever we gotta do to survive, head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)

""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

I remember thinking I would rather die
Than go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I’m ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs
Everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back in forth, on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y’all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimpin’ on everybody and certain motherfuckers 
That want to get in my circle I tell 'em naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy
Naturally, and I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s, fuck ‘em I don’t even botha
And who knows what’s next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Mid-West, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level
Wherever you wanna go, everybody put they hands up I’m ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up

To the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes

Could've got me to the finish like track meets
And when everybody’s hot, I’m past heat
And if I don’t need the fuel, don’t gas me
It’s been a long time coming
Since 100 words and running
Mother fucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then u know we gotta have it
Don’t nobody ever snitch, get pinched? You forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby’s mother 
Never’s gonna know his daddy
Tragic

Why’s the government gotta lie to get money?
Why’s the federal reserve gotta take from me?
Why we even fighting for another country?
Have u seen my city mother fucker we hungry!
Representing for the middle of the map 
Even though me and mine are coming from the bottom
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
Do u really think the Notorious Big would believe these guys?
All these internet thugs that the the media finds
You wanna talk about grind
Look in encyclopedia what name is in it I bet u see mine
Mother fucker this Kells
Skinny boy six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still I came out on t-o-p
This is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had on him was his headphones
So he picks a song
And he turns them on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape
In the kick in the bass

When they heard your boy spitting
Wish I could know what they thinking
When they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing
That I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they wishing they wouldn't have said that shit
I came out of a dying city
Brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do
I did 'bout twice
Multiply that by the battles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration
Bitches more ice
Make a toast to the underdogs
Toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes
Used to talk reckless
But now I push Benz's
And rock Rolex's
Came from the city
And until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side still with me

I do it for the streets

Man I do it for the grease
Man I do it for the five pack of Hanes wife-beats

Couldn't buy my own, so I just borrowed my dad’s tux

So I played sick and lived Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

Runnin' I ain't running, I ain't running away
Runnin' I ain't running, I ain't running away
Runnin' I ain't running away
'Cause I'm so tired of running

That I've worn my soles out,
To the point that my toes is out,
To the point that I can't look back and even if I did
Couldn't see where I started out,
Can't see home for miles,
Lost like another orphan child,
I'm only grinning cause I'm supposed to smile,
So I do it for the ones that are down and out
Proud one of theirs is gonna be a spokesman now,
But I'm still running, running, and I don't know where,
All I got to my name is one pair, of laced up chucks,
Five bucks, and a chip on my shoulder that's so big that I cannot bare,
I done lost my friends, family, and home for this,
And for that I have lost my mind,
Kept my faith, lost my direction
I'm just praying that I haven't lost my time, go!

I keep my head up, with my feet on the ground,
From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm going,
Ready to face all that's in front of me now,
'Cause I'm so tired of runnin'
I'm walking through the fire,
'Cause there is no way around,
Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowing
Ready to face all that's in front of me now,

Runnin' I ain't running, I ain't running away
Runnin' I ain't running away
'Cause I'm so tired of running

I'm so tired of struggling,
I'm so tired of hustling,
I can feel my heart filled with hate,
I'm so tired of loving,
I was supposed to be great,
I'm so tired of ducking,
Tired of coming home from my job being fired from nothing,
And shit I'm tired, from the nights a motherfucker took that ride,
To make that dream come alive,
Then wake up in the morning to a 9 to 5,
But I gotta do it if I wanna survive,
Because in the city where I'm from it's Either do or die,
So choose it wise because you could lose it in the blink of an eye
But even in the darkest times it's proven I

Machine Gun Kelly,"From the bottom of the ash I rose, yeah
To the top I go Where I’m from its cold
But I don’t need this coat, keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city’s area code on my shoulder, 216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove like

“Fuck this broke shit”, petty ass hustlin
Couldn’t even sell one zone
Slim still workin at the store and the only time
We ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here, prayin for a rainbow
To lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to

Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that I made it
Cause’ real EST mufuckas don’t fold
Real EST mufuckas dont break up
Real family grows old, Real EST mufuckas representing
For the city where they came even when they gone

And Fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the Eastside
Just these broken bomes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get their fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep

Muthafuck this rap shit
Try burying your boy 6 feet let me show u bout real
Try telling me that u can’t make it up
Out the city 26 dollars to multi-mill’s
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the Eastside still
Well bitch I did, and its still the kid
Labelled a Bad Boy before this deal

What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that
Bled with me knowin I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Looking at the house of pain
I’ma runaway from the ones that pay me hopin
I’ll stay the same

You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me

Uh, there I go
2 clicks north of the bronx
Whoever thought she would found love in a stereo
2 headphones and a box
She gets me up
Every morning on the walk to school
She ain't worried bout these other little kids
Cuz she told me
Everdyday they sayin something new
And you always got the illest kicks
Boom Boom tat
And she takes me out
Just so the block can see
Told me she wanted the world to know
So she makes me loud
Now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers
And she's all mine
And even though her parents don't like me inside
Whenever her daddy comes around
We just hide
Cuz she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why
I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Yeah, and she loves my sound
It's why I'm always around
One of the most popular girls
In the class
Could... attract the crowd
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cuz at all of the parties
I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song
She might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on
Play the music soft
Yeah so that's what I do
Anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up
Cuz I know my cue
But when they gone
I'm back at it
She loves this song
So I blast it
Dad gets home
I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch
Like gymnastics
Uh and Imma always be there for you
You just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Uh, and she gets older
But I stay the same
And as she grows up
Her opinions change
Now she's off at college
W- are the ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then
I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin about us
Waitin for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch
And get that rush
But I'm not what she needs
So I power down
Then right at that moment
I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

But my voice couldn't save this home

(We just need) Ooh a little more love

In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just is as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catchin' up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night I'm supposed to lose
Just 'cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love

You can give up like they tell you
Stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
But I'm tryna tell you, fuck what they tell you

(I think we, uh) And in these dark times
As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It’s important to know we’re not blind
We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
I would rather die on my feet than live my knees
If I can't live free right now in the world we just need (A little more love)

I can’t solve 'em everyday

Trying to feed his family everyday

Okay, this one for the girl who feeling lost
Because she's trying to find a way, find a way, find a way

Okay, this verse is for my
People on the grind
Going to sleep at 2
Clocking in at 9
Trying to go to school
That's why you’re at the job
Ask me what to do
When you’re reaching for the stars
Jump!
Everybody scared of a little change
That's why I’m always looking out for the little things
You should never be ashamed of a little fame
Even Bill Gates back then had a little name
I’m just saying
Y’all know what it's like when them lights go off in the condo
Need a break from the bullshit pronto
Spend your last check on a trip to Chicago
And see your favorite band on the stage again
In your favorite shirt that you made for them
They play the song and you sang with them
Because music heals the soul
And that moment's there so take it in
Before you’re back in that place again
In the uniform that you hate again
Man this freedom for the world

I'm facing problems everyday
I can’t solve 'em everyday
They want the truth everyday

I can’t afford to go to jail
Moms' putting their houses up for bail
Court stressed me out
Thinking I need a better route
But all these hoes laugh when I’m ashy
And them boys rob if I’m flashy
And them older folks see my tattoos
In their offices and low class me
Man I don’t know what I’m suppose to do
My family is not the Huxtables
I’m just trying to keep my life together
Without breaking all the rules
So I say like five prayers everyday
Until my sins wear away
Let that smoke in meditate
And just chill
Thinking about better days
No more late night belly aches
Use this food for thought everyday
So I will

What if life was simple as a hug?
What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot
His mother's make up smearing on my arms, cryin'
Cause' I'm the only son that she's got now that he's gone
What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal?
You telling me if we couldn't shoot a ball
Our lives still got shooting involved?
And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?
But fuck it this is life
Deal with it or get dealt with
I'm in my room smoking alone like I'm selfish
Cause' some days the sun's hard to face
Dad turns his son wears his face

But look closer see the heart of a lion
Sticks and stones couldn't damage my bones harder then iron
170 Pounds with the walk of a giant
So defiant I pop a Valium, turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume

Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?
(To live in the spotlight)
You'd let me die inside for you

Look, what if money wasn't part of success?
Would the people I used to be friends with never left?
What if making a name didn't come with regrets?
I think that fame's a pre-cursor to death
Death of a friendship, death of a family, death of a man
The misunderstood are always dead before 'they' understand
Staring at ceiling fans, chop up milligrams, draw a pentagram
Lucifer's not a rumor he's in the band, (damn)
Liquor and vomit on my Converse
Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser
Are plastic orange bottles of peer pressure
And I'm ready to cave, I live in a cage
How can I be a hero when I'm the one needing saved
Forty-eight hour days of this fast lane living
Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out then fade away is what Kurt said
I felt the same until I saw his daughter and thought as a father
What if tomorrow, the only I could spoil her was dying?
Started crying then popped a Valium turned up the volume

Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume

For all that it's worth

All of my demons come to life

You'd let me die inside for you

So what you do when the cop lights
Turn into a stage and a spotlight?
And everyone around you starts to hate 'cause you got right
And feel entitled like I'm supposed to stop living my life?
Well this ain't 2Pac, this ain't Em's show
This ain't Jigga man, this that Kells flow

Machine Gun Kelly,"And that was a dark depressing time for him, you know
He did had one visit with his mother I think
During the time that he lived with me and she brought
Him a huge box filled with gifts you know clothes and all
Kinds of little goodies and stuff and it sat in the corner
Untouched, literally for months he'd never opened anything just
Left the box there

What's going on in your mind when someone
You haven't seen since you were nine is out at your door step right now?
Rewind, remember that one time when Marco showed up at the front door
And we found out he escaped from a psych ward
And stole grandma's car?
Ah, rest her soul
I know that's off topic, but I miss her soul
So ironic that she was blind but told me how handsome I was
Every time that I walked in the door
Can't lie and say it was easy being 14 on February 14th
Watching a body die in my arms
Then have to go to a school that I hated
When my grade indicate that I don't give a fuck what's going on
A couple hours later on
And not to mention that one bitch that I loved
By the way I call her ""bitch"" because she was
Wanted me to catch another man fucking her
Invited me over, told me to come into the front
Come upstairs and say what's up
And there she was
Little slut
I was broken hearted, should've broke that bitch's jaw
Just for playin' me like a chump
But instead went to the garage, grabbed one
Of her brother's rifles, went outside, and shot that other
Mothafucka's truck up
I guess that's what lead me to cuffs
Becomin' common in my life like funerals was
Daddy's less common now, he gave up
After he heard the judge pin a fucking felony on his son
Funny enough
Me and Aunt Barbara even closer
Start to feel some weight lift off her shoulder
Till it piled back on when a radiologist told her
That she had breast cancer and might not live much longer
Fast forward
The woman that I call my ""mother"" isn't my mother
Or even blood but that's how much I love her
And I'm feeling awkward 'cause the doorbell's from the person that I call her
Maybe I ain't ready for it
Shit, what should I wear?
Fuck that, I ain't going down there
I waited over a decade for closure
Why should I receive it if it might not be something I want to hear
In the mirror is a empty reflection
And in my head are questions I want to ask like, ""Where the fuck did you go?""
Why did you turn my birthdays to the worst days every year that you didn't show?
And if you must know, I didn't turn out to be much else
Than a drunk who fell face first to a pile of hell
Took four snuffs of the devil's dust
Ended up with my manager helping me 'cause I couldn't take a piss by myself
But I did get a record deal
And all my records got that making of a legend feel
And I did have a daughter who I promised that the way you made me felt
Is a way she will never, feel
Slip a Benadryl in my cup
Ech, fuck it I'm sickening up
Pit of my stomach clenching, all my muscles stiffening up
I ain't been this nervous since I got jumped
Flick the tip of my J over a surface cover with ashes and junk
Took a pull and set it down
Put on both of my Chucks
Reach for the door but my hand's sweaty, I'm anxious as fuck
Couldn't even hit the stairs without
Remembering how many years I was there waiting to see your car pull up
Now you saying she's right there?
Man you saying she's right there?
You telling me if I open up this door right here
That she'll been standing right there?
And after all these years am I wrong for having this fear
Of meeting the reflection that was missing in the mirror
Open up the door and then I see her",Story of the Stairs,2015

This that brand new instrumental
I heard he put his city on
That boy Kells so influential
Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration
'Cause how we supposed to know that what we dream is possible
If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel 'cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
'Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right!
Aye Doug, aye Dray, aye Earl, you know it’s all year right? Hah!
I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City
The night before I gotta turn my second album in
Higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka
With my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago
We were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday
And the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals
And you know, the crazy part is
Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York
I think she had to some work some shit or something like that so she couldn’t go
So we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about
And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended
So I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch
So you can drive in case we get pulled over""
'Cause we got pulled over the last time we went there
But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive
So cut to like 7 and a half hours later
I pull over in this emergency lane
And right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom!
This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us
Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in a ditch
Like 15-20 feet away from where we just were
The car was totaled, the windows were smashed
It was cold as fuck, it was raining outside
But we were, we were actually okay
I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit
He ended up being alright
But our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car
And now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey
So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan
He comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway
I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash
And could’ve died a couple of hours ago
But I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man
I’m not feeling this record label shit
And a, we drove back to Cleveland
Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know
I'm on a shit ton of vicodin 'cause the doctors at the hospital
You know gave us something 'cause we got into that car accident 
And Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like
""Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now
""I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds""
Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise 'cause this dude named Byron
Who ended up becoming my manager later on, took this video I had called “Chip off the Block”
Over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre
And Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff
So I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear
“Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you""
I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it
And sometimes that's all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean
I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Feel that, uh

Life on the edge, hope I never fall
Though you pray I do, what a shame
But I maintain shooting for the stars
Let it bang bitch I'm out of range
And just know I shoot back with my rap name

Put me in a fast car
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free 'cause I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I
Realized it wasn't shit in reality
'Cause you can make it happen and I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon' remember me

Uh, when you see me in that fast car
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I
Realized it wasn't shit in reality
'Cause you can make it happen and I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen, bet they gon' remember me

I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round
Look

Summer day
Bobby and his girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown

Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watch
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading
“I’ll be home tomorrow. Love, Bobby”

Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit
Damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!""
""Wake up!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his
Summer day,
An entire family died on that summer day
‘Cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain

Look, I started with a dollar and a dream, right
So I could show these people how to dream, right
I could show 'em how to aim for the stars
And take it to the arenas from the streetlights
Damn, oh this is what the top feels like? (whoa)
I still remember Ramen noodle meal nights
I still remember checkin' my account
And having 26 dollars, when I signed my record deal night
And I remember being cold
And my apartment used a heater from the kitchen stove
Highs and lows, it's how it goes
So I gotta roll somethin' up
Just to cope with the pressures of growin' up, man

What a week
We made it to the bar 'cause we need heal up
You gotta play for keeps
'Cause aces tend to stay with dealers
You got to believe it
But I'ma sinner too so I ain't preachin'
Just keep on dreamin'
'Cause all the bad days come for good reasons, ay

Yeah, and if I had a dollar
For everytime they told me what I wouldn't be
I would be a rich man with a crib on a big hill (ha forreal)
But I gotta work to get paid
Earn my own way
Work the third shift, burn the whole splits
Says burn up (Hold up, let me get it)
Look, failure is not an option, I gotta be at the top
Like I'm sorry, but I don't really feel sorry for y'all
I'm sorry I got a new number that you can't call
I'm sorry to everyone who still wants me to fall
Hold up, you know what, I ain't sorry at all

So I, hope that it was worth it when you was searched and you found what glitters ain't gold

Add some pieces to the puzzle (ayy)

I don't need love, instant gratification
Cut, copy, and paste 'til the colors are all faded
I don't mean half the mean shit that I say
It's like how I know you fucked every dude on your summer playlist
Want you to want me for more than vacations and cars that go fast
Mansions, mounds of cocaine, and
What's inside my heart is often mistaken
Like hotel room temperature, distant and vacant

I'm filled up with love, I don't want no one to take it
'Cause I've been fucked up since the last time I gave it
Don't tell me you love me, don't say it to say it
Don't ask me who hurt me 'cause the story keeps changin'

Miss you, sex on the couch, it was cool, it was basic
Miss you, flyin' you out on an every week basis
What's changin'?
Maybe I'm fucked up, maybe it's love
I wanna regret you, I can't give you up
Baby, I'm fucked up, maybe it's love
I wanna forget you, it'd be easier that way

Grip the rails, arch your back, show that Holy Grail
Wow, ayy
Put that on the table
Use them nails, scrape my back, scrape and sniff the yayo
Hold up, baby, you are not one to trust, huh?
One of the homies fucked, huh?
You been around, this ain't your first time on the tour bus, huh?
So I just wanna know why you're the only one to die of a drunk text, uh
Prolly 'cause you're the only one that gets me hard during drunk sex, uh
She used two hands, brought a friend to come help
Two G's to myself, two G's for they nose
Two G's on my belt, two G's for these hoes
Two X for my set, two years since I met you

Don't care for no one, only cares for his greed
He's playin' God killin' thousands of people

Racist goal of the white devil

A politician got no feelin'

Let trumpets sound our call
Or by their lives we will fall

Sing revolution's song

They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
'Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money

I take a look through the bars at the last sights

Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Tears they flow but why am I crying?
