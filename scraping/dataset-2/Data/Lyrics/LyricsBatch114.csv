David Banner,"I'd like to welcome y'all back to Mississippi
Yeah, I missed y'all, niggas
As much I know, God is for the thugs too, my nigga

This is for my thug niggas
All the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the motherfuckin' killers
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

This is for my thug niggas
All the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the motherfuckin' killers
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

Daddy in the pen, momma out suckin' dick
I ain't never had fam, so I ride with my click
Said, I die for my click, jealous hoes die too
I would have been a lawyer by the age of twenty two
But I won't, so I don't give a fuck about killing dudes
I sell crack too, I will jack dudes
I dropped out of school to buy my daughter some food

And her momma don't live around here no more
They took her life when they kicked in my door
Yelling bitch where the dope, then blow, blow, blow
They thought I was a beast, tell the bitch, look now

I'mma smoke my weed, I'mma fuck me a hoe
I'mma want your dough, I'mma kick your do'
I'mma slap your hoe, I'mma take your date
When I'm thinkin' about the Lord, I got to see one day, sorry

This is for my thug niggas
All the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the motherfuckin' killers
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

This is for my thug niggas
All the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the motherfuckin' killers
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

I'mma get me a 'laq, I'mma ride down ten
I'mma pray to the Lord, I won't die in the pen
Gotta serve for my sins, I'mma serve me a cop
I gotta watch my back for the fuckin' undercovers

Fuck the clips
Fuck the PD
Fuck 'em
Bitch

I'mma come up to the crib, I'mma flood my block
I'mma ride downtown, yelling, ""Fuck, Trent Lott""
They done raped grandmama, they done took our land
Now they wonder why a nigga don't give a hot damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn

This is for my thug niggas
All the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the motherfuckin' killers
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

This is for my thug niggas
All the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the motherfuckin' killers
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

Lord, save our souls

David Banner,"[Chorus]
I can hear it in the cold of the night, ya'll niggas wanna take ma life (oh)
I been tryin ta do right, but they still wanna take ma life (oh)
I can hear it in the cold fo the night, ya'll niggas wanna take ma life (oh)
I been tryin ta do right, but they still wanna take ma life (oh)

I can feel it in the night time
I say the lord gave life, but these niggas wanna take mine
I heard it through the grapevine
They ain't have to feel, they'd rather see me burnin in hell, n that's the truth
They'll set you up got proof, think about the 12 dicipes
What one traitor did to christ, for small cheese
And they'll do it to me, damn and they'll do it to you
It only takes one in your crew
To cock back, black, and take ya life from you
To cock back, black, and take ya life from you
Damn

[Chorus]

Think about the slave trade, we sold our own jus' to get paid
And now adays it's tha same thang, let ya braids hang
White folks contributed, to gang bang
Gain, dope slang, gain, mayn But we all some thugs
The same one that you love will kill ya ass for drugs
Come to the funeral with kisses and hugs
For ya mom, ya sister, ya brother and all
And really all they wanted was to see you fall
Bestfriend dead for this nigga can ball
Bestfriend dead so tha streets can ball
Damn

[Chorus]

Sometimes I tend to lose my faith
I'm askin' god to hear ma case
If you could see it through ma eyes
They all wanna see me meet my dimize
I feel alone to lose my mind
Beggin' god jus' send me a sign
Tryna do the best that I can
Be a man and follow gods plan
I been tryin' to do right but niggas wanna take my life
I been tryin' to do right and niggas wanna take my life",My Life,2005

Jump in the whip
Let's ride on this like oh oh oh

Let's ride on this like oh oh oh
Let's ride on this like oh oh oh

(Chorus)
I put that on everything
I will be reppin' the south to the day that I die
I put that on everything
From the midwest I'm ready to ride because I'm from the Chi
I'm from the M I'm from the Double the S, y'all know the rest

David Banner,"I'm from a place
Where you gotta let yo' nutz hang
Where them crakas used to cut your stomach open
Just to let your fuckin' guts hang

Right there in front of the kids
I might as well split your wig
'Cause that's just what the master did

But now I'm the new Nat Turner
Spreadin' something to the kids
Like Sojourner, man, the truth

Fuck a 'Creek, I care
But you in doubts and go ""Woof""
He ain't dead, what pledge
There's a stank up in the Bush

Or a stank up in the White House
Shootin' board bullshit, man, it's dead props
Here in Chicago but hit this hi-lo
Warriors come play, click the bottles

Cock them AK's, bust on KK's
With the knuckle boy or the other two and the Stic-Man
Given dead on your shirt like a wristband
You a grown man, nigga, stand tall

Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

Yo, niggas is not original
Niggas follow the radio
Niggas think if you blow
Then you gotta be on the TV show

Crackas is hypocritical
Crackas will rob and shit on you
'Cause see you do what they do
They know freedom is powerful

Niggas is very visual
If we see it, we think it's true
Very few niggas make a move
And even less'll see it through

Crackas make up the chemicals
Then they call us the criminals
Crackas make all the loot
And we just get the residuals

Niggas will rob and shoot on you
Crackas will drop a bomb on you
Niggas is having funerals
Crackas is having barbecues

Niggas sing the blues
That's reminicin' the spiritual
But when you say gawd is you
Niggas ain't really hearing you

Crackas like to capitalize
Them crackas a lie
They say if you don't unionize
Then you'll probably die

I hate callin' niggas, niggas
So I'ma take it backwards
But I got now love for Whithey
I love callin 'em crackas

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long a walk, now that we ridin'

Yeah, I call myself real N I G G A
'Cause Kweli be showin' on the floor
And they policies, my philosophies
Show you that the block is a part of me

Freedom fighter like Richard Carter be
It's deep how the street knowledge beef
'Cause it ran like a code inside of me
It's practical, not scholarly

Now why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me
Who's got my back when the cops harass me
New York, L.A or Cincinnati
Can ride the train or with the Caddie

When they call you, nigga they scared of you
They fearin' you so actually
If crack is gone, be fearing niggas
Then that's what the fuck I have to be now

It's a badge of honor
And some say that shit's absurd
It's more than just a word
We flip the shit like it's a bird

Pass it down through generations
Then cuss you out and say it loud
The first generation of muthafuckas
To grab our nuts and say it proud

Country niggas or city niggas
Tupac niggas or biggie niggas
In the corridor, floor or door
And all my Mississippi niggas

We connected all throughout
The north, the east, the west, the south
And if a white boy say the shit
He'll still get punched right in the mouth

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

All they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga

You see, all they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga

David Banner,"Yeah you know its in me
This ya boy Too Short
I got dat pimpin in me man
And I will...

[Chorus:]
Take your bitch
I'll take your bitch. And you won't say shit
'Cause you a pussy-ass nigga you know
You a pussy-ass nigga you know, I step back
And I'll take your bitch. And you won't say shit
'Cause you a pussy-ass nigga you know
You a pussy-ass nigga you know. I step back

And just like that
She's gone out of your life
I know you going home, but not with ya wife
Something went wrong, she looked hot tonight
A real player showed up, and popped her right
You want her back, but I don't think she comin 
Unless I make her cum...and I ain't frontin
Don't wanna make her my ho... ust had to have that bitch
'Cause you a bitch-ass nigga wit a bad ass bitch. bitch-nigga
You know, all bitches ain't women
You can make a hundred calls and won't get 'em back pimpin
Try everything you know; its the ""L"" and the ""O"". Its the ""V"" and the ""E""
I can tell she a pro. She must have had a lot of practice
Kept her back on the mattress. Either I'm fuckin her good, or she's a damn good actress
All that screamin and hollerin, man she need to go home
I told her cum, take ya slutty ass and leave me alone. Punk bitch!

[Chorus:]

I know you (?) for them bitches, but you playin' super-thug
Man you hollerin' you a pimp, but holding hands in da club
She a slut, she a ho, and you knew it from the start
I put that dick in her mouth, you put love in ya heart
Throw somethin at ya boy in tha clique
But the truth is you sick, 'cause I fucked yo bitch!
Shot cum in her mouth, a nigga ask her for a kiss
The golden shower is the only time that yo bitch get this
Got (?) got da gat, head to ya crib
I done wrecked yo car, man them probably my kids
(on the other hand they not...man she swallowed that shit)
Man the truth is ya girl like to swallow dat dick!
So bow down to a pimp when a nigga come through
And you betta hide ya grandma 'cause I'll fuck her too
Crippled nieces, blind aunt, and you slut-ass cousins
Man I love a dirty ass, 'cause you never see me comin' dumb bitch!

[Chorus:]

Well I was comin down Candy wit dem twenty six inch rims
Rippin' da (?) just mindin my own business
Pull up in the parking lot at da twenty four hour Wendy's
Smokin weed in front of (?) laughin at broke bitches
And bam!
God is my witness, she tapped on my window
I thought it was da ""5-0"", sweatin us for that endo
But naw, it was ya wife, da neighborhood Bimbo
She lookin right, not too thick or too slim though
""What you ova here fo'? I don't understand
I don't know you from (?), is you lookin for yo man?
'Cause I don't fuck wit dat nigga, so don't ask me about him
And I don't smoke wit hoes if I don't know where they mouth been""
Told her to move around, but she wouldn't leave
""Ho, you gone bow down to this (?) and let a pimp breathe""
She got down on her knees, begging me, please, to break her off
I ain't even want yo bitch homeboy, but I'll take her

If you want to girl take your clothes off
On that Rick Flair money everywhere
From the South dog, kush in the air

Cardiers on, or them new Saces, 50 stacks cash, yeah Nitty got me

Still in the hood I don't hang with stars

Leave it all behind and come and ball with me

Poppin' rubber-bands know what I'm talkin' bout

Where the money go, gotta ghost and lay it down

Money on the bed, layin' over G's

Turn 'em round and be poppin' like its soda

That won't whistle, missiles not grisled from fatty tissue

Till I'm die and I'm gone

Cadillacs on twenty two's
I ain't did nothing in my life but stayed true
Pimp my voice and mack these beats and
Pray to the Lord for these Mississippi streets, hey!

God I know that we pimp
God I know that we wrong
God I know why she talk about Moet all of my songs
I know these kids are listening
I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get 'em wit twenty two rims all glisten
I know these balls are talking
Lord I wanna do right
I tried to fight but these demons they comp at me at night
Like my momma, my daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Rachelle but I guess I still got the whining Roy
My cousins sweet, momma lay that Jason
Lord I'm praying for swacking my heart is still impatient
Keep 'em off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell bed or what it was
Yeah smoking get a buzz, but God I hear ya calling
And shit wrong wit balling
But my soul is just steadily falling
And the sex and the dead, and the other jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell?

[Chorus:]

Lord they hung Andre Jones
Lord they hung Reynold Johnson
Lord I wanna fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord just please tell me something
My folks still dumping my music, bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is steadily pumping
My heart is steadily breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man
I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is telling just a place for us to learn
Bout yo love, yo will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here is feeling so dark
Feeling so cold, Lord I'm feeling so old
I dunno if I can take this world right here no more

It was just me in that red Astro van
A box of cd's and a pistol in my hand

Mississippi nigga with a 50 sack of weed
I told them I got that Cali but this here from Tennessee
Sick of leavin' over knees so I had to move quick
I ain't tryin' to ball pimp I'm just tryin' to hit a lick
Then I met this young miss it was back in 96
At a house party rollin' up some dolja in a swiss
Really thought she was a trick so I hit her with my pimp game
Step out to my lac and I'ma show you how to grip grain
I'ma show you how to mix them sprite with them eights
Show you how to ride rock steady on them skates
At the time I never knew this girl would be my soul mate
She said keep me close and ill keep your ass safe
Then I taught country slang and we rolled from my estate
Gave her an AR and started bustin' on them fakes
Then she whispered in my ear no matter how long it takes
You can make it, every myth about your home and your state
We can break it, and no matter what you do let them boys know you smart
Stand up for the poor and keep God in your heart
Now matter what you do let them boys know you smart
Stand up for the poor and keep God in your heart

[Chorus]

I remember falling to my knees asking God for some tracks
He said, make your own son you ain't gotta sell crack
Cut them sappers like they raw and let them fiends smoke that
Go to N-Y-C on faith, im thinking to myself my Lord is that safe?
Uncle Swac gave me a pistol and I left the next day
Homies in Manhattan till I met Mrs. D-A-Y 
In her home she let me stay, studio to studio
Me I'm on my grind, everybody at the crib thought I lost my damn mind
The Noreaga bossed up and bought a beat
This put me on feet, I found a damn way to eat my Lord

[Chorus]

Two years later I'm in the A pimp
But in my soul I feel I need to move back to the Simp
A town they showed me love, they put me on the map
But if I love mississippi I gotta move back
So stop in Birmingham man just for a minute
Niggas stole my red van man and everything in it
Drum machine keyboard and all of my clothes
But I had my pistol with me I'ma kill these hoes
When I left I was with little homie in the Regal
So I grabbed my cell phone and I called Big Siegel
I said, ""Meet me in the Ham big boy it's going down""
God yelled, ""Stop my son and turn around!""
They took your possessions but your souls on safe ground
2 months later I was riding through the Ham
Gotta ten million dollar deal yall, damn! 
Haha thats faith my nigga,
Thank you Lord, thank you",Faith,2008

David Banner,"The same people in the year 1606
Enslaved black folks in the same of the crucifix
And gave us a Jesus with light blue eyes
Hell on earth but heaven in the skies
While they eat they pie now, 
Native Americans got slaughtered layin' passed out
I wanna mash out, but I feel alone
African American, but Africa she ain't our home
Man listen they look at us as cotton pickers
They might as well cause we love to call ourselves niggas
And George Bush is apart of a bigger problem
All America loves hate they will never stop it 
And every rapper that I see has a key but not a key to be free
If God is only one how could she be three
Maybe the key to hell lies in the trinity
Theres no divinity in politics

50 shots for every cop that popped sean bell, his body layin'
But they don't quit cause they know that our generation wont do shit
Nothin', nada, but every rapper is a shotta or a don dotta
Or a killer but you ain't killin' nothin' in this piece unless its another nigga
Tryin to raise boys to supermen, 
And while I'm at it fuck Arthur J. Cooperman
Its never just-ice for blacks but they send just-us to Iraq
With poor whites and Latinos I pray to God that you hear this single
This is Banners middle finger yall, yeah!

[Chorus: x2]
I've been waitin' in the hood for so long (so long)
I've been waitin' in the hood for so long (so long)
For some niggas to stand up in here
We some soldiers and we have no fear

Mrs. Catherin Johnson was murdered by police
In north-west Atlanta but I don't hear it in the streets
With a anger in the hood for this old lady dying
DC 6 aint shit but cops lying 
Ain't shit but bullets flyin' 39 slugs from under-covers
Fuck the law! this was somebody's damn grandmother
And she died over crack sales, crooked ass cops
Or some nigga tryin' to flip yay, yeah
You ain't have to sell it in her yard
You aint trappin  bitch you yappin to the motherfucking Gods  
And I got a damn question, why the city ain't pissed off?
When I know yall heard shots and little lady got hauled off yall, yeah

[Chorus]

I don't understand if you don't ride for something dog
Fight for something, fight anybody but your motherfucking self nigga
We sell drugs, but we only sell drugs to ourself 
We bang and we only bang on ourselves
We do every fucking negative thing and niggas is so hard
Niggas on the radio, on cities, on tapes, in movies 
They got guns, they got pistols, 
But ain't nobody shooting at nothing but they self
Fear is the only thing that people respect
We forget everybody but ourself
These cops gonna have to fear something
Something gonna have to happen
Yall goin' to march, march to the motherfucking cops house my nigga
Make these motherfuckers fear something 
Cause make us, they got us scared
They got niggas scared to go strip clubs nigga
You know shit my nigga like,
Somethin' gotta happen I say it
Cause I ain't scared I ain't scared of shit
I'm scared of god I'm scared of god first
And I'm scared of takin' the blessing that god has given me 
And leading someone down the wrong path (wrong path)",So Long,2008

They're here now
But then they're gone (oh)
Where they at, I don't know
Hey, oh they hit the door
That kinda friend I gotta let go
A super (friend) a super (friend)
Yes sir I got me one of them
A super (friend) a super (friend)
I got me a super friend

No sir there's nothing half way about Him
This world could never be made without Him
No heart no breath no mind
No sun no moon no time
He's something like the best of them
He's nothing like the rest of them

[Chorus]

Lord I'm so weak and scared to run
What have I done to deserve a life like this
The devil's scared to fight us in the light
He hides in the midst of religion
But I know that my God is listening there for me
There's a greater mission
You're no girl, you're no man, but a plan for greater peace
I'll fight for the light until my flesh falls deceased
I'm fighting the devil, fighting police
And in the church Lord I'm looked at as Satan
Cause in my music I curse
But I'm trying to do better and that's the thing that really hurts
All this sex and the drugs in my life mean nothing
When my Superfriend hugs me at night tears come rushing
There's no kryptonite, no dealing no lie that could be told
That can separate the power that you have over my soul
So stunting is a habit when I'm gripping this mic
Y'all thinking I'm a pimp but I'm trying to be like Christ
In real life yeah

[Chorus]

He heard me before I made a sound
Caught me before I hit the ground
He knows everything I need
Before I tell him anything
Loves me without requirements
Cant see Him but it's evident
He's something like the best of them
Said He's nothing like the rest of them

I fucked the mayor's daughter, he hate it when I call her
But I'm still ridin' 'round in that Beamer that he bought her
*phone rings* There she go now
But I'm busy gettin' money on the other side of town
So I ain't a fuckin' john I'll split yo' wig
And I ain't got shit to do wit' yo' kids

Poke out'cha chest, ball up ya fist buddy ya still a bitch

So if it seem like I'm buzzin' I'm sholliz
Fuckin' wit' my country cousin and them, from Mobile
'Bama bred backwood niggas we so trill
Let the foot watch me and lil Rich gettin' in hoes' ears
What it is? Damn right, we ain't a role model
Half-pints to half a gallon, we drank the whole bottle
That's why them hoes holla, they know I'm 'bout a dollar
And they might, get to ride Impala, only if they swallow

I see the kids wanna rap like me
'Cause ya see me wit' the bitches livin' life on T.V.
Around in my hood, boys fillin' graves up
Niggas talkin' that shit, see the techs raise up
Hangin' wit' the convicts and my boy Attitude
I was fuckin' plenty bitches in the back of the school
Can't you tell motherfucker I was raised by the streets
Fuck you studio gangstas, niggas reppin' on beats
My uncle doin' fed down in Talladega bitch
It ain't shit you can tell me about Lil' Rich
You better take ya lil' kids to the pastor
Rich Boy ain't a role model for them bastards

She was talkin' to me, said
""Son do you know who I am? Who I happen to be?""
And I told her, ""The Might Magnolia that stand tall 
for the shoulders of slaves and soldiers when the days get colder""
I'm so older but I'm young in my spirit
From the blood I'd hear it
From Mr. Malcom Garvey and Marley
Then she started to tell me
How she was used in the lynching of blacks
Branch cracked, broke her arms so his neck would snap
And if I wouldn't rap I'd probably meet the same damn fate
From the same damn rope, I'm 'bout the same damn weight

Let me try to offer ya'll a whole 'nother perspective really quick
Now this African American officer was an undercover
He lost a little brother because of a gang color
Which eventually accelerated the cancer that killed his mother
And he was married to a white woman that they called a nigga lover
And it became a full time job not to kill a nigga
I wonder does he still consider that he's still a nigga
We all got choices, and the real recognize what's real and chose
But he's basically still undercover in his civilian clothes
All the right reasons
But he may not even get that love again
'Cause salary's still not enough to be a Republican
Issues of growin' up without a dad
Had 1 too many one night and forgot his badge
A brawl ensued with a racist cop
Didn't stop and ask
He was sure that he was a nigga when he shot his ass

Oh Mother Magnolia
Your daughters and your sons
May the sky start cryin'
As they hung lifeless from your arms
Please Mother Magnolia
Although the fruit is strange
It's been such a long time comin'
But will the seasons ever change?

If a tree could speak
It's probably shed a tear and weep
For the skin like mine
For being there behind Confederate lines

And who are these people
Well if I'm honest with myself at all these are my people
Man what else can I say

You still lived on the street where you laid down for good
We all sat on the floor as my kids swam around us
You smoked cigarettes like I knew you would

We were worried about your personal salvation
Was it heaven or hell that you saw when your eyes closed?
You smiled at us floating high above the question
Like you knew something we didn't know

Singing ""Pictures of You"", crashing cars, skipping school
We drove all over town as the days blurred around us
We wore out your cassettes, we were nobody's fools

They read us a poem, ""Oh The Places You'll Go!""

""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots
Mr. Grinch!
Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch!
With a nauseous super naus!

And you drive a crooked hoss

With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch",2006

Fly away wherever you want to.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

And every mother's child is gonna spy

David Bisbal,"Corazón latino, corazón latino. 

Creo que en el amor lo mejor está en el sur. 
Que tiene magia y ritmo que sabe a vino y ron. 
Es como un hechizo que no pude desterrar. 
Una piel dorada con sabor a sal. 

Déjate llevar por el embrujo de este sol. 
De guitarra vieja a la orilla del mar. 
Dale a tu vida una fiesta sin final, 
Llénala de sol, llénala de vida. 

Corazón latino, de sangre caliente pegada a tu piel. 
Corazón latino, te invita a vivir un verano sin fin. 
Corazón latino, tatuado en fuego en tu blanca piel. 
Corazón latino, locura y deseo hasta el amanecer. 

Corazón, ay ay ay, corazón. 

De sabor a fresa, aroma de palmeral. 
Noches de luna llena perfumadas de azahar. 
Siempre has comprobado que jamás olvidarás, 
Las caricias puras un te quiero y un adiós. 

Dale a tu vida una fiesta sin final. 
Llénala de sol, llénala de mi.

Que lo que nunca he tenido

perdóname si hoy busco en la arena
Esa luna llena que araba el mar

Si alguna vez fui un ave de paso
Lo olvide para anidar hay en tus brazos
Si alguna vez fui tierno y fui bueno
Fue enredado en tu cuello y tus senos
Si alguna ve fui sabio en amores
Lo aprendí de tus labios cantores

Si alguna vez amé, si algún día
Después de amar, amé
Fue por tu amor, Lucia, Lucia

El olvido solo se llevé la mitad
Y tu sombra aun se acuesta en mi cama
Con la oscuridad entre mi almohada y mi soledad

No habrá forma de hallar salvacion

Porque sabe que tu estas

Ay vida, que palpita de alegria
Que me embriaga el sentimiento
Con tus besos mas y mas

Ay pieles, el embrujo de la luna
La belleza de una rosa
Y la tibieza del mar

Ay eres, vino dulce de las uvas
Donde bebo con tus labios
De la fuente para amar

Es la sangre de la tierra en que nací
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Ganas, de vivir aqui a tu lado
A tu cuerpo encadenado
Hechizado de pasion

Ay nada, sin tu amor yo no soy nada
Soy un barco a la deriva
Que naufraga de dolor

El perfume de tu aliento quiero respirar
Y esa magia que hay en tu mirar
Ser el hero de tus sueños todo y mucho mas
Quiero ser tu calma y tempestad

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Acercate muy lento dejate sentir
Enciende ya este fuego que hay dentro de mi

Ay, ay, ay, no me dejes sin tu amor
Sin tus besos soy un pobre corazon
Ay, ay, ay, no me dejes sin tu amor
A tu lado no hay pesares no hay dolor
Ay, ay, ay, no me dejes sin tu amor
Que tu recuerdo siempre va por donde voy

Ay virgencita del cielo como la quiero
Ella es la luna, ella es la luna, sin ella muero

De rodillas yo te lo pido
Dile que yo la estoy amando
Ya no quiero vivir solito
Dime hasta cuando

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

David Bisbal,"Voy
Perdiendo vuelo entre el cielo y tus ojos
Atando en sueños tu piel a mi piel
Contando estrellas al amanecer

Voy
Tejiendo historias de amores perdidos
Y en la memoria recuerdos heridos de amor
Mientras se embriaga de ti mi corazón

Cuento las horas en que tú no estás
Ven a mis brazos que no puedo más
Será que alguna vez
Será que un día vendrás
Dime que tú me amarás

Camina y ven
Que estoy desesperado
Que sueño con tenerte aqui a mi lado
No olvido tu querer
Tu cuerpo de mujer
Ya ves que soy un loco enamorado de tu piel

Camina y ven
Que muero en agonía
Sabes muy bien
Que pronto será mía
El tiempo se nos va
Y nunca volverá
Ven que mi corazón no puede más

Voy
Imaginando tu piel con la mía
Y Voy llenando mis noches vacías
Borrando huellas de mi soledad

Y así
Beber tu cuerpo plateado de luna
Y en cada beso atrapar mi locura por ti
Sacar pos siemprede mi pecho esta obsesión

Cuento las horas en que tú no estás
Ven a mis brazos que no puedo más
Será que alguna vez
Será que un día vendrás

David Bisbal,"Era una tarde de verano que anochecía en la ciudad
Entre el flamenco, el vino tinto y una canción de Serrat

Me hechizó aquella mirada llena de alma y picardía
La alegría de su cuerpo despertaba un huracán

Con una flecha aquí en mi pecho
Quedó grabado su misterio
El conjuro de sus besos encendió la tentación

Dime gitana adonde fuiste 
Que me he perdido en éste sueño
Y hasta el día en que te encuentre me resisto a despertar

Por ti, por el deseo abandonado en ésta piel
Juro que algún día yo te encontraré

Cómo olvidar tus ojos verdes esmeralda
Que me robaron hasta el alma
Que me han dejado el corazón en soledad
Cómo olvidar tu canto de sirena 
Que ahora corre por mis venas y me puede envenenar

Tu inocencia y tu calor
El refugio de tu piel

Hoy las horas llenan los recuerdos de tu adiós

David Bisbal,"Despertar en el frio abismo de tu ausencia
Es rogar por las horas perdidas en mi habitación
Recordar cada lagrima que fue tan nuestra
Me desangra el alma, me desangra el alma

Es andar el sendero que escribimos juntos
Es tocar un silencio profundo en el corazon
Escapar por las brechas de un amor profundo
Es mentir de nuevo por negar tu ausencia

Esta ausencia tan grande
tan dura, tan honda
Que quiebra en pedazos
Mi razón.

Esta ausencia desnuda
De dudas y sombras
Me clava tu amor

Esta ausencia que duele 
En el fondo del alma
Que quema por dentro 
Mi sueño y mi calma

Esta ausencia de hielo
De piel, de silencio
Que corta las horas sin piedad

Esta ausencia infinita 
De noches y días
No tiene final

Fue tan fácil decir 
Que el adiós sanaría
Las espinas clavadas 
En tu alma y la mía

Esta ausencia me grita
Que se acaba la vida
Porque no volverás, volverás.

Ya lo ves, tu partida no condujo a nada
Porque nada haré el tiempo a la sombra de mi soledad
Ya lo ves, derrotado y sin hallar la calma
Que daría por verte y olvidarle todo.

Esta ausencia tan grande
tan dura, tan honda
Que quiebra en pedazos
Mi razón.

Esta ausencia me grita
Que se acaba la vida
Porque no volverás

David Bisbal,"Cuándo das amor de más
Cuándo eliges por error
Y por error esperas la llamada 
Cuándo no da más el corazón de tanto amar
Cuándo das por equivocación
Cuándo das amor de menos
Y exageras los olvidos
Se pasan los detalles sin querer
Cuándo falta voluntad en no se que
Cuándo no te enteras que se fue
Se acaba lo que a gritos fue un eterno amor
Todo se acabó la primavera en el desierto
Se murió de pena la ilusión y la alegría
Vino el desamor un día entre los dos
Se acaba por que ya no aguanta más la piel
Se acabó el dolor porque no habrá dolor más grande

Nos unió el amor hoy nos unio el adios
Vino el desamor entre tu y yo
Cuando eliges con orgullo lo que es mio y lo que es tuyo
En vano es tu llena necesidad
Cuando no hace falta hablar en todo el día
Cuando libre es tu unica verdad
Se acaba lo que a gritos fue un eterno amor
Todo se acabo la primavera en el desierto
Se murio de pena la ilusion y la alegria
Vino el desamor un día entre los dos
Se acaba por que ya no aguanta mas la piel
Se acabo el dolor pq no habra dolor mas grande

O toda mi esperanza
Te llevaste el amor que te di

Congela mi alma
Es que me has dejado

Te llevaste todo de mi
Ay de mi
Mi orgullo why mi placer

Ay, tu ausencia es agonia
Que va matando lento todo mi ser
Aaay tu ausencia dejo tristeza
Que me esta acabando
Acabando de perder

No tengo mas suspiros
Que recuerdos
De un amor que fue para mi
Mi mas grande anhelo
Ah

Se fueron escapando sentimientos
Pobres de mis ojos como te lloran
Es que no te olvido

Voy a olvidarte lo se

All the things I wanna hear
You say you're sorry and you can change
If I give you one more chance

But I've heard it all before
You can't hurt me anymore
All the lying and all the pain
Now there's nothing left to break

I know what you're feeling
Don't it hurt now
I hope it hurts so bad

Cry, I wanna see the tears
In your eyes for me
You've thrown it all away

There's nothing you can say
Just cry for me
Cry for me, cry for me

I've cried so many nights
With you lying by my side
And was so lonely in love with you
Now I feel like such a fool

But my tears have all run dry
Now I need to see you cry
For all that you have put me through
It's all coming back to you

Yes, I know
What you're feeling
Don't it hurt now?
I hope it hurts so bad

Cry, I wanna see the tears
In your eyes for me
You've thrown it all away

There's nothing you can say
Just cry for me
Cry for me, cry for me

I gave it all to you, baby
Again and again and again
I want it back now

I hope it hurts
I really hope it hurts you now
So cry for me

You've thrown it all away
There's nothing you can say
Just cry for me, cry for me

Que lo que mata es ser indiferente 
No des la vuelta a la tormenta

David Bisbal,"Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, ya llega el dolor
Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, soledad

Si, fue hace algún tiempo atrás entre unas copas
De más, uuna de aquellas historias que se suelen
Olvidar, cuento o imaginación, fantasía o realidad
Nunca lo sabré no lo puedo negar

Y fue aquella que tomó mi mano, me la leyó y me dijo
Hermano, a ella a la que tu le das el corazón no es
Para ti, entre cubos diferentes y murmurará la gente
Sin saber que te esperaba al fin el verdadero amor

Y verás lo que es tener a quien te quiera de verdad
No dudes más, lo que te digo se hará pronto realidad
Será tu luz, será quien te abra el corazón de par en par
Es tiempo ya para olvidar, serás feliz ya lo verás
Escucha ya, lo que la gente diga no te ha de importar

Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, ya llega el dolor
Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, soledad

No, saber si fue un juego de azar o saber si estaba
Escrito ya, pero bébete hasta el fondo el trago de la
Decepción, embrujo o premonición, destino o casualidad
Así son las cosas del misterio del amor

Y hoy tengo a la que he soñaba, la mujer que me
Esperaba, alguien que me llena el alma y me devuelve
La ilusión, aun recuerdo a esa gitana, con la luz en su
Mirada, que en mi mano dibujaba el rumbo de mi corazón

Y puede hallar a la mujer a quien yo quiero de verdad
No dudo más, con su conjuro se hizo pronto realidad
Ella es mi luz, ella es quien me abre el corazón de par en par
Ahora su amor es lo más grande que me pude imaginar
Lo que ocurrió, lo que pasó fue por que tubo que pasar

Ves que he sufrido en el pasado, con las cosas
Que dicen y hacen daño de verdad, pero también
Tengo lo que había soñado, la que pinta de alegrías
El paisaje que una vez fue el de mi soledad

Y verás lo que es tener a quien te quiera de verdad
No dudes más, lo que te digo se hará pronto realidad
Será tu luz, será quien te abra el corazón de par en par
Es tiempo ya para olvidar, serás feliz ya lo verás
Escucha ya, lo que la gente diga no te ha de importar

A entregarte otra vez sin medir, los abrazos que des

Le pido a Dios
Un toque de inspiración
Para decir lo que tú esperas oír de mí

Aquí estoy yo
Abriéndote mi corazón
Llenando tu falta de amor
Cerrándole el paso al dolor
No temas yo te cuidaré, solo acéptame

Dame tus alas 
Las voy a curar

Te invito a volar

Y aún me mira a mí
No tiene piedad, sufrirás
Su nueva presa serás

Que lo mismo me hizo a mí
Es una actriz
Que solo sabe mentir
Y ahora va a por ti va a por ti

Sé que te pones enfermo
Con su forma de bailar
Pero ese es su secreto
Cuando sale a cazar

Juega con él, se ríe de ti
Me mira a mí
No tiene piedad, sufrirás
Su nueva presa serás

Que lo mismo me hizo a mí
Es una actriz
Que sólo sabe mentir
Y ahora va a por ti

Poco a poco se aproxima
A tu cuello y sientes fuego
Mi pasado, está sangrando
Quién avisa no es traidor

No tiene piedad, sufrirás
Su nueva presa serás

Que lo mismo me hizo a mí
Es una actriz
Que solo sabe mentir

En tu alma why la mia

Que se acaba la vida
Porque no volveras, volveras.

Porque nada hare el tiempo a la sombra de mi soledad
Ya lo ves, derrotado why sin hallar la calma
Que daria por verte why olvidarlo todo.

Pero yo he tenido que volver a mi niñez una vez más
Me sigo preguntando
Por qué te sigo amando y dejaste sangrando mis heridas

No puedo colmarte ni de joyas ni dinero
Pero puedo darte un corazon que es verdadero
Mis alas en el viento necesitan de tus besos
Acompáñame en el viaje que volar solo no puedo

Y sabes que eres la princesa de mis sueños encantados
Cuántas guerras he librado por tenerte aquí a mi lado
No me canso de buscarte, no me importará arriesgarte
Si al final de esta aventura yo lograra conquistarte
Y he pintado a mi princesa en un cuadro imaginario
Le cantaba en el oído, susurrando muy despacio
Tanto tiempo he naufragado y yo sé que no fue en vano
No he dejado de intentarlo, porque creo en los milagros

Sigo caminando en el desierto del deseo
Tantas madrugadas me he perdido en el recuerdo
Viviendo el desespero
Muriendo en la tristeza por no haber cambiar ese destino

No puedo colmarte ni de joyas ni dinero
Pero puedo darte un corazón que es verdadero
Mis alas en el viento necesitan de tus besos
Acompáñame en el viaje que volar solo no puedo

David Bisbal,"He encontrado la palabra amar 
En las paginas de mi destino 
Entre el polvo de la soledad 
Y este corazon que se ha perdido 
Vientos y mareas 
Y un alma que se enreda 
En un descuido tras la piel 
Que pequeña es hoy la inmensidad 
Ante las barreras de uno mismo 
Que difícil se hace respirar 
En el armario de los miedos escondidos 
Lléname la vida 

De mil cosas bonitas 
Y no sueltes mi mano jamas 
Aunque dure lo que dura un vals 
Y al fin nos hunda el mar 
Si falta el aire yo me iré
Caminando entre las flores 
Recogiendo cada lagrima 
Si falta el aire ayúdame
Se valiente y no me falles 
No me falles que este sueño es tuyo y mio 
He buscado a solas mi mitad 
Devorando el ansia de mis días 

He surcado abismos sin final 
Desatandome con tus caricias 
Curame esta herida 
Y sálvame sin prisa 
Soñemos cada despertar 
Aunque dure lo que dura un vals 
Y al fin nos hunda el mar 
Si falta el aire yo me iré
Caminando entre las flores 

Recogiendo cada lagrima 
Si falta el aire ayúdame
Se valiente y no me falles

They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam

Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way'
'Love is the answer,' that's what they say

But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

But we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that faithful day

And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

Perdón si no encuentro mi estabilidad emocional

Perdón si te busco, y lloro en tu cara
Perdón si una cita te echado a perder
Nos dimos un tiempo, y sigo aquí esperando
Dijiste mi niño te prometo, que vamos a volver

Si no te abrazo en 24 horas soy un hombre muerto
Me urge que me digas que me amas y me beses lento

Si no te abrazo en 24 horas mi mundo termina
Si te retractas a olvidar que existo me alargas la vida

Si te demoras a decir que sí, vas a volver junto a mi
Será letal para mi corazón, y no vuelve a latir

Perdón por las rosas que no recibiste
Perdón si hoy demuestro sensibilidad
De lunes a lunes, te he estado extrañando
Te amo y me muero, por otra oportunidad

Si no te abrazo en 24 horas soy un hombre muerto
Me urge que me digas que me amas y me beses lento

David Bisbal,"I met this pretty girl
She was from D.C.
I liked the way that she smiled

Said, “There’s a party tonight,
You oughta come with me.”
She said, “Baby, I’ll try.”

I waited all night long
For her to walk in
For her to bring me her light

Then she came in the room
She looked right at me
She was the vision of my life

Can’t wipe the smile off my face
Ain’t nothin’ bringing me down

I feel like stompin’ my feet
I feel like groovin’ all night

With your body close to me
I hope you can feel my energy
Watch you move your body
Get hot with me

David Bisbal,"Ella, se desliza y me atropella
Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Se, que el da que la pierda,
Volver a sufrir por
Ella, que aparece y que se esconde;
Que se marcha y que se queda;
Que es pregunta y es respuesta;
Que es mi oscuridad, mi estrella
Ella, me peina el alma y me la enreda;
Va conmigo pero no se donde va
Mi rival, mi compañera;
Que esté tan dentro de mi vida y,
A la vez, esté tan fuera,
Se que volver a perderme y,
La encontrar de nuevo
Pero con otro rostro y otro
Nombre diferente y otro cuerpo
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva;
Nunca me responde si, al girar la rueda

Ella, se hace fría y se hace eterna;
Un suspiro en la tormenta,
A la que tantas veces le cambió la voz
Gente que va y que viene y, siempre es
Ella, que me miente y me lo niega;
Que me olvida y me recuerda
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca,
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca y,
Al llamarla nombro a otra,
A veces siente compasión por este loco,
Ciego y loco corazón

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar
Que hay quien no tiene corazón
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema
Y, si fuera ella?
Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda;
Va conmigo digo yo,
Mi rival, mi compañera; esa es ella
Pero me cuesta, cuando otro adiós se ve tan cerca
Y, la perder de nuevo, y otra vez preguntar,
Mientras se va y, no habrá respuesta
Y, si esa que se aleja
La que estoy perdiendo
Y, si fuera ella? y, si fuera ella?

Que hay quien no tiene corazón
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema

Que sientes al rozar mi piel

Que esta agonía se la lleva el viento

Que no he sabido acariciar, quizá
qué debo hacer para volver atrás?

Donde tengo la pena 
Que me dejo tu adiós, 
En un rincón del alma 
Se aburre aquél poema 
Que nuestro amor creo

Que el tiempo me robó, 
Tu cara, tus cabellos 
Que tantas noches

Como he querido yo, 
Me parece mentira

David Bisbal,"Hoy me levanto como quien naufraga
Solo y empapado con perfume a mar
Como si estuvieras en otro hemisferio
Y yo no alcanzara a navegarte más

Y me he asomado a mi ventana
Como si fuera mio lo que veo detrás
Pero los paisajes, amor no tienen dueño
Por mucho que te mire mía no serás

Tan sólo lo confesaré una vez
Hay algo en ti que declarar
Algo se me escapa en la melancolía
La ola que aprendió a volar

Y es que el amor, no es perfecto
Es un pasillo incierto
Con su sombra y con su luz
Así es nuestro amor de pequeño
Es un paisaje incierto
Con su cara y con su cruz
No estamos preparados para esto
Lo estábamos, pero ya no
Hoy nuestro amor, sin prospecto
Es como un verso suelto
Incierto, con su sombra y con su luz

Hoy me he levantado como quien naufraga
Pero hay latitudes donde brilla el sol
Se apaga otro farol, y se enciende el alba
Sola está la luna, fuera en el balcón

Y entonces me doy cuenta de una vez
Que solo quiero navegar
Y algo se me enciende dentro de mi anatomía
Las olas no saben nadar

Porque el amor no es perfecto
Es un pasillo incierto
Con su sombra y con su luz
Y es que el amor va en el viento
Va siempre mar abierto
Con su sombra y con su luz

No estamos preparados para todo esto
Lo estábamos pero ya no
Hoy nuestro amor ya no es nuestro
Es un pasillo incierto
Con su sombra y con su luz

Fuego de noche, nieve de día 

Y mientras yo me quedo sin ti 
Como un huracán, rabioso y febril 
Tanta pasión, tanta osadía 
Oh tú

David Bisbal,"Te has vuelto una razón para decir
Que doy mi vida a cambio de tu amor
Fue un beso infinito, un segundo contigo
Estoy perdiendo en ti mi corazón

Te has vuelto una razón para sentir
Que callas el vacío en mi interior
Hoy tengo en mis manos el alma rogando
Que sientas lo que estoy sintiendo yo

Escúchame, que el amor es como es
Llega en silencio y descalzo
Entiéndeme, yo no descansaré
Hasta tenerte a mi lado

Para enamorarte de mí
Yo seré quien tome en sus manos la luna
Y te la entregaré

Para enamorarte de mí
Yo seré tu cómplice
En cualquier locura y te acompañaré

Seré tu soldado
En tu cuerpo tu esclavo
Guardián del sabor de tu piel
Por siempre, mi amor, he jurado
Que así te amaré

Te has vuelto una razón para pensar
Que el cielo me ha devuelto algún favor

Tus ojos me llenan
El tiempo se frena
Buscando enamorarte como yo

Escúchame, que el amor es como es
Llega en silencio y descalzo
Entiéndeme, yo no descansaré
Hasta tenerte a mi lado

Para enamorarte de mí
Yo seré quien tome en sus manos la luna
Y te la entregaré

Para enamorarte de mí
Yo seré tu cómplice
En cualquier locura y te acompañaré

David Bisbal,"Vale, no esta claro
Pero hoy vamos del revés
Con la lista interminable de reproches
Con la habitación pintada de veneno
Con la rabia que nos deja sin aliento
En la niebla donde no se ve horizonte

Vale no esta claro
Pero hoy vamos otra vez
Con el sueño convertido en pesadilla
Masticando las palabras con cristales
Lastimando, provocando tempestades
Separados y tan juntos en la huida
Vida que locura aun te quiero en la tortura
Están sueltas las palabras y la noche no descansa
El latido a contratiempo
Quien lo ha dicho que no es cierto
Corazones sin caricias, desertores en ceniza, vida

Vale no esta claro pero hoy vamos sin saber
En la noche de los lobos eclipsando a las estrellas
Tan unidos tan atados, tan nosotros dos diablos
Que son buenos en el fondo
Absorbiendonos esta obsesión necesitados

Vida que locura, mas te quiero no hay tortura
Nos hablamos sin palabras
Y la noche se desata en latidos
Cuando es nuestro siempre evitas, nunca es cierto
Corazones que se aman, desertores que se extrañan
Vida que locura aun te quiero en la tortura
Están sueltas las palabras y la noche no descansa
El latido a contratiempo quien lo ha dicho que no es cierto
Corazones sin caricias, desertores en cenizas, vida, vida","Vida, Qué Locura",2014
David Bisbal,"Valore cada silencio
Tus miradas y tus gestos
Sera por el misterio de vivir
De vivir, vivir, vivir otra vida
Olvidándonos del miedo de la duda del no puedo
Invente otros ojos para ti
Para mi, para mirarte a escondidas
Para ver crecer esta locura, ya lo ves
Hoy se rinden los soldados de mi piel

Lo pensamos en alto
Y dejamos caer un te quiero callado los dos abrazados
Nuestras frentes pegadas y sobre el tejado una luna
Y allí te amé y así se ven, dos almas en una, burbuja

Inventamos palabras y códigos nuevos
Abriéndole paso al amor
Para si dar rienda libre a este sueño
Resguardamos palomas detrás del sombrero
Fue magia de lluvia y abril
Abril, mientras te echaba de menos
No quiero ser amante en la penumbra
Quiero ser la luz, la sal, tu despertar

Lo pensamos en alto
Y dejamos caer un te quiero callado los dos abrazados
Nuestras frentes pegadas y sobre el tejado una luna
Y allí te amé y así se ven, dos almas en una, burbuja

Lo pensamos en alto
Y dejamos caer un te quiero callado los dos abrazados

David Bisbal,"Preguntas cómo hemos llegado a esta situación
De odiarnos y de avasallarnos con tanto rencor
¿Por qué?, preguntas ¿por qué?, ¿por qué?

Incrédulos ante el abismo que nos parte en dos
Afanas toda la indulgencia nunca das un yo
¿Por qué?, insistes ¿por qué? ¿por qué?

Renaces embriagada en ira por el que dirán
Me increpas, consternada y lloras que no puedes más
¿Por qué?, me gritas ¿por qué? ¿por qué?
Y me empiezo a preguntar si la respuesta te valdrá

Culpable de decir ya basta
Cuanto me desgastas con cada porqué
Culpable de quererte tanto que me equivoqué
Culpable de pedir perdón, de no saber cuál fue mi error
Culpable de seguir tratando de calmar tu voz

Si vuelves a preguntar, responderé con mi verdad
Culpable de decir ya basta

La mitad del tiempo (la mitad del tiempo)
Yo no estoy contigo (yo no estoy contigo)
Pero el otro tiempo que me das es cuando yo revivo

Por eso oh, oh, oh,
Un poquito de tu amor,
Es lo que a mi me cura las heridas
Ahora emprendes la partida.
Por eso oh, oh, oh,
Ven y cura este dolor,
Y este corazón que se desangra
Y que pierde los latidos,
Que este amor tiene sentido

David Bisbal,"Nunca imagine que con el tiempo acabaría pasando
Que al tumbarme al lado izquierdo de esta cama
Ya no estés a mi lado
Proyectadas en el techo nuestras sombras parecían gigantes
Nos creímos que la vida nos daría un destino tan grande
Y el cielo apago la luz

Tu, una estrella fugaz
Un fragmento de sol se desvanece
Sol, quien te mira pasar, deseando olvidar y no amanece

Sobra tanto con lo que arroparse que hasta el frio se queja
Y por mas que sigo alerta nunca encuentro una caricia de vuelta
Y en lugar de abandonar reclamare tu luz.

Tu, una estrella fugaz, un fragmento de sol se desvanece
Sol, quien te mira pasar, intentando olvidar y no amanece

Puedo figurarte prendida mi cabeza
Pero no puedo explicarte
Que el peso de tu ausencia me desvela apagando del sol

Mientras lanzaba piedras a la luna
Con la fuerza de una lágrima
Me olvidé despertar a la voz de tus caricias mudas
Quisimos buscaros judas
La luz que no vimos nunca, nunca

Me olvidé respirar, como un beso bajo el agua
Me olvidé respirar, al sentir dejarte atrás
No hay oxígeno de más
No hay palabras, ya no hay tiempo
No puedo más

Desnudame la piel
Y el corsé de mis labios
Me adentraré con mis dedos
En la geografía de tu espalda.

Quisimos borrar las dudas
Y no arrepentirnos nunca, nunca, nunca

Lo que vendrá

No eran mis recuerdos
Siempre supe que no eras normal, no

Sin preguntas, sin reproches, sin más

Siempre supe que
Siempre supe que, llegará

Me hables puedo imaginar
No hacen falta más razones

Y si el invierno se va olvidando del calor 
Y la memoria del recuerdo
Si el principio olvida el fin 
Que se acabó con un pretexto
Yo te enseñaré a olvidar amor",Yo Te Enseñare A Olvidar,2016
David Bisbal,"Ella se desliza y me atropella 
Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Sé que el día que la pierda volveré a sufrir 
Por ella, que aparece y que se esconde
Que se marcha y que se queda
Que es pregunta y es respuesta 
Que es mi oscuridad, estrella

Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda 
Va conmigo pero no sé dónde va 
Mi rival, mi compañera, que está tan dentro de mi vida 
Y, a la vez, está tan fuera, sé que volveré a perderme 
Y la encontraré de nuevo 
Pero con otro rostro y otro nombre diferente y otro cuerpo 
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva
Nunca me responde, si al girar la rueda

Ella se hace fría y se hace eterna 
Un suspiro en la tormenta, a la que tantas veces le cambió la voz 
Gente que va y que viene y siempre es ella 
Que me miente y me lo niega, que me olvida y me recuerda 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Y al llamarla nombro a otra 
A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

Sea, lo que quiera Dios que sea 
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar que quien no tiene corazón 
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema 
Y, ¿ si fuera ella? 

Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda 
Va conmigo digo yo 
Mi rival, mi compañera, esa es ella 
Pero me cuesta cuando otro adiós se ve tan cerca 
Y la perderé de nuevo, y otra vez preguntaré 
Mientras se va y no habrá respuesta 
Y, si esa que se aleja
La que estoy perdiendo
Y, ¿si esa era? y ¿si fuera ella? 

Ah, sea, lo que quiera dios que sea 
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar que quien no tiene corazón 
Y va quemándome y me quema 
Y, ¿ si fuera ella?

David Bitelli,"I'm walking through a wasted land
Of soft sell concrete and rust
What ever happened to this country?
Where is the hand you can trust?
Walk down, walk down, walk down

I remember when a farmer was ashamed
If he never put his hand to a plough
You can buy a lot of shame with your money
He's riding in a limousine now
Walk down, walk down, walk down, walk down!

Sweat is the name of this town
It's an ugly old, dirty old disgrace
And now that the steel's shut down
It's fear puts the sweat in a man's face
Walk down, walk down, walk down

Oh now I should have a break like you
But somebody stacked up the decks
Heads are going to roll some day
If we ever get this yoke off our necks
Walk down, walk down, walk down, oh

Well I'm walking through a wasted land
I'm walking through a wasted land
Where is the future we planned
I'm walking through a wasted land
Walk down, walk down, walk down, walk down!",Walking Through a Wasted Land,1993
David Björkman,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanation, no questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",I Let the Music Speak,2014

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

David Blue,"The room it was lit up me too I couldn't sit up
Engaged was my time in studying the wall
And all the poets kept getting louder
Even though they weren't needed any longer
The strapless high heeled street walker
Believes every day that she goes younger

Ah I wish I could be her lover
And go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

The poets would keep on all night with their come ons
One would say something another'd say more
Looking for contracts but finding the soap
Well I know she'd take them all for a joke
Ah but she'd take them all no doubt
And they never knowing what it was about

Ah I wish I could be her lover 
And go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

With burning candle and the store window
Hard to believe there could be more
And all the poets complained of the cold
But they only did what they were told
Searching so hard for a satisfied mind
While she walked by with a satisfied soul

Ah I wish I could be her lover
And go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

A radio played on to almost no one
Attention was paid only to the dawn
As she stopped and bent to touch her nylons
And felt in the air for a post to lean on
No one could ever know her outside
In the take of an instant she had passed by

Well I wish I could be her lover
Go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

Symbols and motives were again promoted
Hard to believe there could be more
As she moved on and then faded out
To the songs of the poet still keeping it up
The sidewalks cleared themselves for a new touch
And it all disappeared into the face of the clock.",Midnight Through Morning,1966
David Blue,"I loved Marianne in the winter
In the loft of her favorite lover
She was growing older
The winter nights were cold
She told me I'm frightened
I said yes I know.

Her eyes held me to her
They burned with such a fire
For the saints on the walls
Holy candles in the halls
For those who had left her
I held her and cried.

[Chorus]
Oh, Marianne you are beautiful
To be this friend
To a stranger who
Leaves you only to fall
Do not cry you have helped me
I will not say goodbye.

I know her from another song
Her older poet wrote before
We played it in the morning laughing on the floor
Till he came knocking on the lower East Side door.

Yes you know I miss her
Her and her stories of the night
I called her a rabbit
She gave me back my life
I haven't heard her voice since the Isle of Wight.

[Chorus]",Marianne,1972
David Blue,"I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son 
The highway is my legacy 
On the highway I will run 
In one hand I've a Bible 

In the other I've got a gun 
Well, don' you know me 
I'm the man who won 
Woman don't try to love me 

Don't try to understand 
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe 
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day 
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go 

And all my love's in danger
'Cause I steal hearts and souls 
Woman, don't try to love me 
Don't try to understand a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 
Ooh

Woman, don't try to love me 
Don't try to understand 
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 

Some me call me Abel
Some men call me Cain, 
Some men call me sinner, Lord 
Some men call me saint

Some men say there ain't

Then there's nothin' left to gain

David Bowie,"He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City

There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise?
As I walk down the aisle

Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?
Deadens? my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone

And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street

Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?
Deadens? my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone

David Bowie,"Between the dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys snapping pics
Of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable

He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white god
Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable

Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
That's a mighty big word for a nine year old

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable

Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly,
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you

And little is new

The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

""I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul

I crushed my heart
To ease their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare

Who praised their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide,
For little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

I bless you madly,
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time,
At times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you
That sets the test

So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

""We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe""

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command

David Bowie,"Was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
""God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today""

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor

Crying
""God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
The other way

I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wander
I travel ever onwards to your land

Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place

You'll kill another man

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide

You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I

David Bowie,"The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass,
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land.
It was ragged and naive.
It was Heaven.

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life.
We claimed the very source of joy ran through.
It didn't, but it seemed that way.
I kissed a lot of people that day.

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon,
To paint that love upon a white balloon,
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his 
Brain.
Satoria must be something just the same.

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size.
We talked with tall Venusians passing through.
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared,
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud.
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd.
And we walked back to the road, unchained.

Of the great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails

As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly

David Bowie,"Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:

""It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always 
Really free""

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud

And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy 
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
""Stop, Freecloud 
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them

Power is weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold

Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo

David Bowie,"Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words had truthful vengeance
That could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Gave your heart to every bedsit room, at least a
Picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
Your paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Ah, couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes
Here she comes, and here she comes",Song for Bob Dylan,1971
David Bowie,"The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws

Is in the sun that pins
The branches to the sky, oh, oh, oh",Eight Line Peom,1971

From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs

I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play 
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head

With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder called life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall

Sweet head, give you sweet head
(spoken: while ya down there)

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud

Became the special man, then we were ziggy's band

He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

Just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Oh

The kids were just crass, he was the naz
With god given ass

David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square,
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over,
We had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us,
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet,
Then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head,
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,
I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm,
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor,
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine,
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot

Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town

Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new

We can all pull on through

Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

Keep me satisfied

She's a-calling from inside

Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage

Of darkness and disgrace

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
Yes he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love
I could not obey

Of darkness and dismay

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, his song went on forever

But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind

You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if i could only
Make you care

A brave son, who gave his life
To save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

David Bowie,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

Keep her comin'
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

He's so simple-minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

David Bowie,"She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odor
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear
Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress

Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

David Bowie,"Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past?
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are

He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boys

Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time, in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Oh, well, I look at my watch, it say nine twenty-five

You are not evicting time

Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

David Bowie,"Shaky threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street, looking for information

Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh",The Width of a Circle [*],1974
David Bowie,"It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says:

""Boys, Boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, Boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, Boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing""

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburg, as in

""Boys, Boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, Boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, Boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing""

We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake

Someone scrawled on the wall ""I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses""
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces; Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
""If you want it, Boys, get it here, thing""

So you scream out of line:
""I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?""
Tres butch little number whines ""Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces""
If you want it, Boys, get it here, thing

Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands

And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers,
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue.

For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell

Bent on getting hung and buried

His face is sans feature but she wears a diamond broach

Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff

From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color

Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stays

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down

Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonder when

Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful

Now the workers have struck for fame

Rule Britannia is out of bounds

David Bowie,"There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Til the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

""Ah-choo, excuse me""

Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket

""God, it's pouring down""

Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God

No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes myself
And this one here's for you

""Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain""

Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle

On Sunset and Vine

You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

And I was seething, breathing deeply

All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come

Written in pain, written in awe

That we'd never close again

And I stole her room

David Bowie,"Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Slow down, slow down

Slow down, slow down

David Bowie,"Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Let me sleep beside you

David Bowie,"War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy

Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more
To the little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again

Her hobnail boots were full of holes
She's got medals

Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh

Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls

Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze

Traffic blocked off by SWAT troops

You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning

Now you has class
Now you has splash
Now you has mass motivation

Here's an image I can recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
Get you fired up and burning go oh oh

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

Lust
Gluttony
Pride
Anger
Sloth
Avarice
And jealousy

You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, just a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original (that's motivation)
Stimulating, charismatic (that's motivation)
As precious from home (that's motivation)

Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes

Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart

David Bowie,"Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider.
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,
In weeks creating a macabre

Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,
Like floors in a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.
One could almost call it an altar.
When the breeze blew through this construction,
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.
Tiny wails, tiny cries.

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone

David Bowie,"In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
""Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamp

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

David Bowie,"There's a full time reservation
Made in a bar at the railway station,
And there's a story, a kind of fable,
On a card at the corner table.
On it is a message; been there some time.
It starts of, ""The coffee tasted so fine""

It says, ""One day, this may find you,
These few words may remind you.
We sat here together just to pass time;
You said how the coffee tasted so fine.""

It goes on to say, ""I love you
If you should find this I must hear from you.""
It gives a number but the name has faded away.
All that is left are just the words, ""Maybe someday""

That's the story and the fable;
Never leave alone from a corner table.

Found him slumped across the table. A gun and me alone

David Bowie,"Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:

""It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always
Really free""

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy
From Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wild eyed boy
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
""Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles

They said the things to make it seem improbable
Whale of a lie like they hope it was

And the good men tomorrow had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighings swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun, the Bewlay Brothers

In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was stone and he was wax so he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and though it was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
The solid book we wrote cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moon boys, the Bewlay Brothers

With our backs on the arch
And if the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers

And now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
Woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead, he could be not, he could be you
He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature
Shooting up pie in the sky
Bewlay brothers
In the feeble, in the bad
Bewlay brothers

In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so turned on
In the night walk pavilion

Lay me place and bake me pie I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked I might just slip away

Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat

They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat

And cutting this hay
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm gonna die

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I said, I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
Will pardon them (I won't be breaking no rocks)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)

take me away

We spoke of was and when 
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend 
Which came as some surprise 
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me 
I never lost control 
You're face to face 
With the man who sold the world
 
I laughed and shook his hand 
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare 
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

Not me

David Bowie,"He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table a gun and me alone
I ran to the window looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit he'd left me an autograph
Let me collect dust I wish someone would phone

David Bowie,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

Since I found you

Holding out and falling out
But the baby can, the baby can

I'm the jumping man
But baby can float
Baby can drown

Baby can touch her toes
Toss her hair
Makes you feel
You're going nowhere

Baby can walk around the town
Attract a man and cut him down

I'm the shadow man, the jumping jack
The man who can and don't look back
But the baby can, the baby can

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can, the baby can

And the way it feels
I'm feeling you

Toss her hair

Attract a man and cut him down

Baby can float

From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean

Here are we, one magical movement from kether to malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon from station to station

The return of the thin white duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes

And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down

From Vivian at Pentecost Lane
A shriekin' and dancing till four a.m.
Another night of muscles and pain
I love you despite your convictions
That God never laughs at my jokes

I'm a young man at odds with the Bible
But I don't pretend faith never works
When we're down on our knees
Prayin' at the bus stop

Now Jesus he came in a vision
And offered you redemption from sin
I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you
But are you sure that it really was him
I've been told that it could've been blue cheese
Or the meal that we ate down the road

I'm a young man at odds with the Bible
But I don't pretend faith never works
When we're down on our knees
Prayin' at the bus stop

They're riding on the streets

They'll ride you off your feet

Yeah, piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and Coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
The pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
And they'll ride you down to Hell

And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth, it sticks like glue

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire

To take your little body
And throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

The subway down to Hell

Crucifix hangs and my heart's in my mouth but it's here

Heaven's in here

Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here

Heaven in one sigh, heaven in two eyes
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls

We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in

David Bowie,"Wish I were a sailor crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies, under your eyes
But I can't see too far with these animal eyes
Can't hold my breath without your voice

An' I'm danger-prone, I'll be bound
I'll be fast as hell without your touch
An' I'll run, run, run, run, run
An' I'll run, run, run, run, run without your love

I'm a Goldman, I'm a soaring tower
And it's cold in here without your love
Trouble in here, trouble out there
Mainline problems 'til you no longer care

Get a long-low life, it's duty bound
No hope, no life, no you, aha
And I run, run, run, run, run, run
Without your love

I duck the shots, tilt the world
I talk myself crazy, shoot the breeze
Shout to live, shoot to kill
Double up in pain, I'm on my knees
",Run,1989
David Bowie,"Some days he feels so empty, just a talking head
Married to a Klingon who'd cream him in the press
God could detonate him, God's the one we pick to curse us
And 25 years pass him like an evening at the circus

Don't sacrifice yourself, don't sacrifice yourself
Surprise yourself, don't sacrifice yourself
Don't sacrifice yourself, don't sacrifice yourself

There it is, the look, the winner you once talked of being
Give her one last kiss and dive right out the window screaming
No truth decent, it was summer from the waist down
She blew the troops right off your feet, tells you she's God's Grammy

Don't sacrifice yourself, don't sacrifice yourself
Surprise yourself, don't sacrifice yourself
Don't sacrifice yourself, don't sacrifice yourself

Her, the only game in town, a queen of competence
Blind in front of mirrors, proving nothing says a lot
Wham bam, thank you Charles, vanity is all
You wander lonely to the scene, a-crawling up the walls

Don't sacrifice yourself

There's mindless maggot glare

Make some new computer thing that puts me on the moon
Not this psycho, time-bomb planet poised to meet it's maker

Then wash their crusty hands

Under the God, under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God, under the God
Ten steps into the crazy, crazy

Washington heads in the toilet bowl
Don't see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate

Toxic jungle of Uzi trails
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
Well, you're dead, you just ain't buried yet

So, the secrets that we shared
I believed you by the palace gates
Now the savage days are here

They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till you`re so fucking crazy you can`t fallow their rules

Ah then they expect you to pick a career
When you can`t really function you`re so full of fear

And you think you`re so clever and classless and free
But you`re still fucking peasants as far as I can see

I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade

I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said ""Sit down"" I stood up.
Ooh-ooh growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing,
I pushed be	-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing,
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said ""Come down"" I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath.
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car

David Bowie,"This ain't rock'n'roll, this is genocide

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are stabilized

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go

But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore

Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if he'll ever know

She was shakin' like this honey doing that

A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for

The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow

You're acting funny, try to spend my money
You out there playing your high class games
Of sorrow, sorrow

You never do what you know you ought to
Something tells me you're the devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow

I tried to find her cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her

The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow

He lays her down, he frowns
Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries where have all Papa's heroes gone?

All night
She wants a young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
For even yesterday?

Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have

All night
All night was a young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
All right you want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his Soul Train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?

All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American

We could have great conversations
Lookin' through windows for demons
Watchin' the young advance in all electric

And, ah, they won't let me see anybody

My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go

Walk out of her heart

In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat

Oh, yeah

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames

If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a queen and such a queen

So I throw both his bags down the hall

Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home

Don't let the milk float ride your mind

You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone

We're dead, we're sick and hanging by thread
Get real, get real

You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real, get real

I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom failures fall all over town
I guess I should, I feel I should, get real, get real

What's up? What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what? What went down?
Get real, get real

Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
Get real, get real

I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel I should, I guess I should, get real, get real
Get real, get real

The seed, the curse, the jazz of life

Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
""Good God, oh my"", I cry
And die, and lie beside

She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped
A dope she roped this salty lie

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within despite the rain
My words are worn

She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who, no matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line

And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again

On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex, of sex

Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes

David Bowie,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine [Live],1997
David Bowie,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

Keep her comin'
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear

David Bowie,"He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the national people's gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
Let me collect dust, I wish someone would phone

David Bowie,"War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade

Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days

Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before

Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone

Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly

When silhouettes fall

Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through a crack in the past

Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street

The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long
For this is not a miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
This is not America
This is not

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground
So bloody red tomorrows clouds

A little piece of you
The little piece in me

Keep me running, running scared

And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?

And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?

So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky

On a bridge of violent people, I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die

The Gods forgot they made me so I forgot them to

Where's the sense in staying right? Who said time is on my side?

You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hate it when you lied

I'm waiting for the man

Twenty six dollars in my hand

Up to Lexington, One Two Five

So sick and dirty more dead than alive

I'm waiting for the man


Hey white boy, what you doing uptown?

Hey white boy, you're chasing all the women around

Oh pardon me sir it's furthest from my mind

I'm just looking for a good friend of mine

I'm waiting for the man


Here he comes, he's all dressed in black

PR shoes, and a big straw hat

He's never early, he's always late

First thing you learn is that you've always got to wait

I'm waiting for the man


Brown stone building and three flights of stairs

Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares

He's got the works and he gives you sweet taste

But then you've got to split because you've got no time to waste

I'm waiting for the man


Baby don't you holler, darling don't you scream and shout

I'm feeling good, I'm going to work it on out

I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine

Until tomorrow but that's just another time

I'm waiting for the man


I'm waiting for the man

Twenty six dollars lying there in my hand

Up to Lexington, One Two Five five

So sick and dirty more dead than alive

I'm waiting for the man

I'll take it by your side.
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide.
I'll take it by your side.
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies.
I'll take it by your side.
Over saturation curls the skin and tans the hide.
I'll take it by your side.

You've never seen the lonely me at all

David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumor spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.

And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know""
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be

And he laughed insane and quipped ""Kahlil Gibran""
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye""
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind

Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag

And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again""
(Turn around,go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around,go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply

And I was seething, breathing deeply

He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you, oh

David Bowie,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

David Bowie,"Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much 

Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown 

I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park 

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance 

You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all
",Almost Grown,2000
David Bowie,"[Chorus]
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed Beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

[Chorus]

""Die"" said the General
""Cobblers"" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said ""Sir,
There's a crack in the world""
And the figures went ""squash"",
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

[Chorus: x2]

When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky",Bombers,2000
David Bowie,"Gather 'round all you people
Watch me while you can
Been trawling too long, I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man

I've been hasty, wasty standing on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring
But this semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink

I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel, you don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend

May the devil take all you men

To help yourselves to a friend

There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay 
So we bargain with the devil, ? they say

Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things 
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut 
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts
