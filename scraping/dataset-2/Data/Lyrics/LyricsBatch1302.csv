(You have whispered these things to me)

You have caused flowers to grow in my fields
And you have brought bright colours to my head
And you have caused a cool wind to blow underneath my window sill
And I rest here underneath your hand

You made all my deserts into gardens (x2)
You made all my ashes into beauty (x2)

I don't know where I'd be if I had not met you
I was a broken man when you found me (x2)

I hold your hand but I won't squeeze too tight
I feed you food that you've never eaten
I think about it and my heart starts beating
I look at you and it nearly wrecks me

I meet her mom, I say my name is Kevi
I'm so dizzy when I'm with your daughter
But I treat her right, I never cross no border
We get in the car, I say ""Ya want some music?""
She says

So I say ""You choose it""
Straight out the purse comes 1000 Clowns, and I say
""Oh, God, I know my girl is down""
We go away for the cozy vacation
Santa Barbara is our destination
Halfway on our way I start to feel real ready
I pull the car over ""Will you be my steady?""

It feels so damn good to even take her bowling

Would ya be my sunshine?
Would ya be all mine?

Would ya be my sunshine?
Could ya be all mine?

We're still together, we hang out all the time
She comes to the show when I bust a rhyme
She never minds that my friends keep me late
She's cool like that, she'll kick back and wait
Never hesitate to hold my hand, whispers in my ear
""Kevi you're my man""
See, that's the plan, now there's no more adore

Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat

Well my kitty cat ran I was so sad inside
The feelings that I have I can no longer hide
I want him back as fast as I can
He's my little buddy and I'm his friend

Without my little kitty I don't know what to do
I'm felling sad and blue
He has a little red nose and a fuzzy head
A soft couch to sleep on, he's quite well fed
Instead I will brush and pet him all the time
I think he really likes it cause he gives the sign
A little nudge of his nose and a sandpaper lick
Sticks his claws in my back and I scream aww shit
But he doesn't mean to hurt I'm gonna be real kind
Without my little kitty think I'm losin' my mind

I'm bribin' other cats to search for Max
I Said, I'm bribin other cats to search for Max
I'm offerin things that they can't refuse
Like Purina cat chow and some soft beef chews
A little mousy and a ball of catnip
A bowl of cream and some tuna-fish dip
I think its kind of working cus they're searching around
Max is a homie and he must be found
I leave the windows open, I hope that he'll jump in
I've gotta see him soon, he's such a cute little thing
So if you're out there Max and you hear this song
Hey, little buddy, will ya please come home?

I called my man Bret to explain my situation
He said grab a pen and paper, start a new creation
Radio stations all across the nation 
Will be down no doubt with your unique situation
I remember the days when I would go to bed
Wake up in the morning with Max on my head 
My face so full of hair I'd want ta scream and holler
Unable because my mouth's full of flea collar
But that's the fact, he's gone and I'm blue
I wrote this little song, think it's the right thing to do

So, little girl if you can find my kitty
Will you please bring him back to my part of the city
If you bring him back soon you get a sweet surprise
I'll kiss you right on the mouth and take a swim in your eyes
I think it's a fair fee so I hope you're down

From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,1990

101 Strings Orchestra,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

That old black magic that you weave so well

The same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

That saved a wretch like me.

Was blind, but now I see.

And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

It’s not somebody who has seen the light

What a privilege to carry

Is there trouble anywhere?

101 Strings Orchestra,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2006

There must have been some magic in that

He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be

We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler Stop!

Had to hurry on his way

Ever since they left me in a basket
On the freeway 

It's me that's been doggin' your shadow

You got me hung up lock and stock and barrel
I'll always be behind you in the fog 

So you better not annoy me
Or I'll do somethin' that I might regret
You'd better not annoy me or I'll do 
Somethin' that you won't forget in a hurry
And I might be back for some sloppy seconds 

You've heard me heavy breathing on the telephone
My word they say that I'm belongin'
In a home for crazy people
But you know I don't belong there
I was an orphan and I couldn't help it 
I'd been in and out of trouble
Ever since they left me
In a basket on the freeway

Listen to our motto
Be prepared for ecstasy

And brings her beauty to a bottomless day
She's bathing, al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display

And the boys in the gang
Think she's part of the scenery

Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life

Feel the love

My facade starts to crumble
So strange your reaction
I made the right connection now
You got me no bother
I can't see any other

Just something only captured in a dream.
Whoa, then suddenly

I wasn't looking for a love explosion,
But I must have been a target my oh my.
Cause when I least expected it,
I took a direct hit,
Right between the eyes

You, you shattered my resistance, yes its true,
you battered my defenses what could I do?
I'm running from the heat between me and you.

You nail me with a lightning bolt,
Oh, baby, you knock me cold.
You're love zapped me, right between the eyes.

Now nothing's going to cool down my desire,
'Cause I'm jumpin' from the fat into the fire,
Love bug has bitten me, 
And you're hitting me,
Right between the eyes

And now each time I think about you I don't know how,
I ever did without you, spin me 'round,
And I'll never get my feet back on the ground.

See a lot of Triple see
Dedicated to my homies every wagon stone
Dedicated to the hoes that love to flow
Cause I love to drop the shit, the shit will make you ill
Stayin' true to my game, and my game is truly real

You get in they head before you get in they bed
And number two, girls run like buses, you may miss one
Catch another one every  hour on the hour, promptly
And number three, what that girl ain't willin' to do
You got a hundred more girls more than willin'
And number four, is a  new rule to the new pimp testament

That don't make no sense

Knowing that no one's there 
Something is telling me 
That you feel the way I do 
I dream of you all the time 
Wishing that you were mine 
I'm feeling so empty 
Hoping you'll think of me 
I need ya here tonight 

[Chorus]
If I'm all alone 
And you're all alone 
Ain't nothing wrong 
Having someone to hold 
Oh, your tender touch 
It means so much 
It feels so right having someone to hold 
It's very plain to see 
I want you next to me 
Give me your hand and 
I'll try to understand 
Girl I love you so 
I can't let you go 
Ain't nothing wrong with having someone to hold 

Every now and then 
I get to wondering 
Are you with someone else 
Or could you be by yourself 
I turn on the TV 
It's a picture of you and me 
And I'm going crazy 
Cause I miss my baby 
I want you here tonight, tonight 

[Chorus]

Baby, I love you so 
And everything that you have done for me 
No one has ever done before 
And I'll never let you go

Whenever I'm alone with you 
Is irreplaceable

You tell me that I'm the only one
You say you'll never leave me lonely, girl

I never wanna see your face again
I don't even wanna be your friend
Don't wanna be used by you again
So I'm saying goodbye

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known

Listen baby

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you

Alright
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself

I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you

I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the ball
you should get 10 points just for being On My Arm
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a then
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative ten""
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See life is like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you.
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else

I would be with you
Always

I felt the tears gone to my eyes. 
Seeing that the love that you've been longing for,

Day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice
On the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
I see you next to never
How can we stay forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted
All the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter and I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh can you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance, but in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you

Or how my heart breaks

Little Cease, I'd a cop, rock, all types of a satch 

50 G's on the watch, me and you up in the Spot 

MtV was in shock, and I don't see why not 

Man, we used to rock all the BET spots 

Turned clubs into stadiums 

And I remember when you and Rock got knocked in the Paladium 

And when we rock we do it all for you 

And uh, don't gotta worry bout the names they was calling you 

And I'ma tell you what we gonna do 

Make hits and couldn't quit if we wanted to (yes I, won't stop) 

Even though you're outta sight, you're never outta mind 

I try to tell myself, when it's yo time, it's yo time 

Ever since that weekend, everybody been beefin' and greifing 

Losin they appetites, nobody eatin (miss you, yeah) 

And it's due to all the weavin, I walked yo kidz to your coffin 

And tell em ?daddy's sleeping? (daddy's sleeping) 

But Killa he don't understand 

He don't know that ignorance killed a wonderful man 

You're not just another Rapper, wit money in yo hand 

I think, what's the money, when I ain't got my man 

That's why day's I walk the surface, feeling earthless (Oh Biggie) 

Thinking was this rap shit really worth it (is it really worth it?) 

And I know you didn't deserve it, It went so smooth 

You thought they rehearsed it, Worst shit I ever 

Seen at a young age, it's fucked up when I see my man on front page 

I reminisce on the old days, Love, Forever and Always

I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

On the patio we can make a night you won't forget

As I softly pull your hair

On top of mine so take your time

Roll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I bump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true player's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cause I'm hot now
You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now

Tryin' to lure me out on the dance floor

Oh oh, everyday
This is the real right here
Things ain't always what 
They seem check it

People look at us 
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what 
Comes along with it
With all the fame and the 
Fortune there's still bull

Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything 
Just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators

Cause they don't 
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal ain't a good 
Record deal, but I'm a grown man 
So I didn't cry about it

Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer 
Use to say, but I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday, ya

Everyday the pressures of 
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's 
Another thing it's another thing

This game got us goin insane

What's goin on with one twelve
If they leave, if they leave
Are their records gonna sell
They say that he gave us the hits
Knowin' damn well that we write our own sh

It's not that I'm mad about it
But I gotta clear it up 
For those wonderin about it
I think you need to read the credits
Open up the CD dog and read the credits
Cause things ain't always what they seem
So don't believe everything you see on TV

In the videos, I was in a Bentley
And that Bentley in it, belonged to me
My earrings had to be at least five carrots
I had to live up to that superstar status
Stayed on the road had to stay 
Doing shows even though I'm going broke
I couldn't let nobody know

Everyday the pressures of 
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's 
Another thing it's another thing
Everyday the pressures of 
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's 
Another thing it's another thing

People look at us and say 
How does it feel on a new label
With a multi million dollar deal?
I'm just glad we stayed together
We put our faith in the lord 
And he made things better
Cause he said it in his word
That one day your gonna get
What y'all deserve, wow

Now aren't ya glad we stayed together
Through the good and the bad times
We stayed together
Through the rich and the broke times
Through stormy weather
And hey, now we look back like
Don't you remember 

When you couldn't afford that boy
Hey, sunroof top
Chillin' on the scene 
With a down south female
Like hey, how ya love that
Twenty four inch rims
Big body Cadillac
And hey, we do it like that

This game got us goin insane

A man is important
In a scheme of things
He's the King of his castle
And the head of his household
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in

[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in ""Yeah"" ""Yeah"" Yeah""]

A man is imperative
In the world we live
He's a father to his children
And the head of a nation
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a provider
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt

Now tell me who's the King of his castle
And tell me who wears the pants around here
who's a father to his children
A man like me
Now who would be the queen of the castle
Sitting beside you through the thick and the thin
She's the corner stone of this family
She's the mother of the earth
Even though she living in

You should've known that I loved you
You should've seen it in my eyes

That my love it wasn't going nowhere
No one but you was in my heart

It's too late
You missed out on me
And I'm so sad
Sad that you're gone away
I'm sorry you missed out on me
But it's too late
You let love slip away

And you should have known that I was open
You should've seen it in my smile
Should've allowed yourself to be an adult instead of a child
But you were the one with insecurities
So don't try and put the blame on me
You never knew that my love was really here to stay

How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes

And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth

I can't understand da reason, why you, why you
want to play me, you said, you would never me said,
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you want to play me

We were real, we were chill you would tell me how you feel you wanted me
You needed me da only one to ease your mind I was
Caught by surprise when you say you want to leave
But it's cool if you gotta go then go ahead n leave imma be around

How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder

They already know they gotta pay for they meals
Say I'm, comin' at you with lines, think they lies
Just because I don't match your compatible sign
I'ma let the world see, other boos can't relate
Let you walk in front, make the other dudes hate
When I put it on you, you throw it right back (ha ha)
Who else you know gon' poke it like that?
And ma I'm gon' show you like that, you be hollerin'

We can take baby steps, that may be the best

If you been for lookin' for the right one, well here he is
Ready to take things a little mo' serious
Ain't nervous no more, you heard it all before
Are you a Fifth Ave miss, but you workin' that velour?
Stop, I'm tired of trickin', I'm tired of pigeons
Need a house with acres to put my wife and kids in
Chefs are good when they gettin' right in the kitchen

Baby let me be with you more, hold you more
Let me get the chance, I can show you more
Let me get to know you more, I'll be screamin' out

If I could, wife you out, ride this out
You're the only one I wouldn't ride without
I could show you what this life's about
I be screamin' out, ""Ma ma-ma ma, ma ma ma ma""

This is the type of shit right here, listen
You gotta go to the car wash on this one
Hehe, you can't ride around dirty and dusty and shit

Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa-oh
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple ""hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, over you

Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool (why was I such a fool?)
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone
(Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno?) (tears gonne 'cause an inferno, baby)

I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go

[Chorus: x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us want to be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go

Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it

I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge]
Oh girl
What happened to the love
What happen to the girl
The girl I fell in love with
I never thought I'd been the one to say goodbye
I'm sick and tried of the arguing and I don't want to do it again
Again, woo

112,"If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I ain't never,
Lemme say that again,
I ain't never, goin' nowhere
Listen to me

Last night I almost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gonna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that I've got for you
I'm telling you

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere

I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
until I found you and you made it
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you don't know the half of it
But baby here's the rest of it

Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby that's for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this

When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be 'with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere

Made a vow before God to love me
And finally I'm walking down that aisle
I will never second guess us how
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together
Having kids together, my life begins right now

Finally the day has arrived
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle

Half of me is crying, the other half smiles
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it
Take the vow to be together forever
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds

But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, ""I do""

113,"Hier encore j'ai mal dormi,
J'ai cru entendre du bruit,
Le lendemain j'ai appris
Que les keufs avaient fait une sauterie. 
Fruit de l'opération, un homme mort dans un lit. 
Cela fait déjà une semaine si on en croit l'autopsie. 
Ça fait maintenant 1001 nuits 
Que j'ai le sommeil légué. 
Je n'ai fermé qu'un œil, les sirènes m'ont réveillées. 
J'ai vu des gyrophares bleus fuser dans toute la ville 
A la poursuite de voitures aux mains de conducteurs habiles. 
Mes voisins d'en face, je les ai jamais sentis, 
Car du soir au matin, j'entendais des cris, 
C'était le mari qui tabassait 
Sa femme et ses enfants. 
Mais le jour de son jugement, 
On lui a dit, t'es innocent. 
2 3 mecs de mon quartier sont partis s'amuser en boîte, 
Et pour pas finir dans la boîte, armés jusqu'au coup ils débarquent. 
Ça s'éclate un max, tout le monde est pété au whisky, 
En 10 secondes ça tourne en coup de bouteille et en coup de slash. 
Je suis choqué quand je vois dormir des SDF dehors, 
Allongés par terre, j'ai l'impression qu'ils sont morts, 
Perdus dans leurs cauchemars entre la vie et la mort, 
C'est à la morgue que cet hiver on retrouvera leur corps. 
Ça fait à peine 5 minutes qu'un détenu est libérable, 
Les murs l'ont rendus instable, 
Je crois qu'il a pété un câble. 
La nuit est à sa merci, y a rien de bon dans son regard. 
Le lendemain très tôt, retour à la case départ. 

Pour un oui pour un non ça prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui déraille
Gare à ce moment là, que les cœurs soient de taille
Je marche à un mètre du sol et je suis super fly

Pour un oui pour un non ça prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui déraille
Gare à ce moment là, que les cœurs soient de taille
Je marche à un mètre du sol et je suis super fly

A notre instar dans le ghetto c'est l'abattoir. 
Vaut mieux être vigilant et vivre sur ton trottoir 
Les espoirs sont minces, tu connais l'histoire 
Fais gaffes à toi le soir on t'attend dans ton couloir. 
Perdu dans une soirée où je suis même pas invité, 
Y avait que des crânes rasés avec des blousons de l'armée 
Dans leur Levis serré, au coup la croix gammée. 
Apparemment des skins décidés et affamés. 
Plus le temps passe, plus il fait sombre. 
Plus les nuits tombent, 
Plus de frères à l'ombre. 
La nuit c'est le bordel, 
Parfois c'est mortel. 
Demande aux keufs qui se prennent des explosifs cocktails. 
Après une demie heure de marche 
On se gare dans une impasse. 
Un chat noir qui passe, 
Synonyme de poisse. 
Faut pas qu'on reste sur place. 
Y a comme une odeur de chiasse. 
Mon pote t'étais pas loin du compte, y a les keufs face à face.

113,"Tu connais la chanson, garçon, mauvais garçon,
Noirs et arabes, actions puis arrestations,
Altercations, humiliation, on nous met la pression
On nous dit qu'on est en infraction et direct des explications.
On parle d'immigration et me demande si je vote aux élections
J'ai pas de sélection, je crie tout haut ""Je baise votre nation""
Provocation, et mets en fonction leur écusson
""Suivez-nous les garçons""
Et c'est le début de la détention.

La cause de l'arrestation, Un joint de ma confection.
Selon la tradition, du popo comme une mission.
12 grammes en ma possession,
Ils commencent les questions.
Citations classiques, poucave, c'est pas ma profession.
Je leur dis que c'est ma conso, direct comparution.
Devant la barre, à mon égard libération.

""Bon on les relâche là,
Mais à la première occase on les épingle, hein""

Après l'excursion on se rafraîchit d'une fraîche boisson
Et comme discussion la police et leurs sanctions.
En voiture à fond, un bon son association,
Les keufs sont au feu rouge, attention, disparition.
Face à la police, me rendre hors de question
L'uniforme bleu, depuis tout petit nous haïssons
Produits stupéfiants et pe-pom comme protection

""Bon là on se dirige vers la cité Camille Groult là,
Apparemment y a du bordel là, donc on va régler ça, terminé""

Minuit, les rues sombres sont laissées aux bandits
C'est aussi qu'à cet heure-ci
Que les keufs cherchent les ennuis.
309 bleu nuit, débarquent dans le hall sans faire de bruit,
3 inspecteurs, on est 10, en plus des nazis.
Ils nous ont pas fouillés, c'est bizarre ça sent le roussi.
Commencent à nous parler, son haleine pue le whisky.
Se laisse emporter, se 'plaint que son fils fume du teuschi.
L'un d'entre eux, l'a informé, qu'un dealer vendait ici.
Ça m'étonne pas c'est bien les réactions d'un fils de képi.
En plus on s'en bat les couilles, il a pas de preuve, je serai pas poursuivi.
Je rentre à la baraque, à 4 du mat', terminer ma nuit,
Rêver du dernier, chut que j'ai récemment acquis.
2, 3 heures après, un bruit de fond, j'entends la sonnerie,
Oh merde un troupeau de keufs et je suis même pas sorti de mon lit.
Menottes aux poignets, vu la situation c'est reparti,
Après perquisition, séjour au commissariat de Vitry.

""On a interpellé les suspects c'est bon
On peut les emmener dans les locaux""

Faut pas qu'y ait une bavure ou dans la ville ça va péter,
La cité une bombe à retardement, je crois ça va tester
Du commissaire au stagiaire: tous détestés!
De Fresnes à la Santé, vrais bonhommes on va résister.
A la moindre occasion, dès que tu le peux, faut les baiser.
Ils veulent stopper les pauvres qui prennent l'oseille des plus aisés.
L'honneur est en jeu, prends tes couilles, faut pas hésiter.
On est de mauvaise humeur, les troupes d'élite sont excitées.

Je m´approche vers lui et je lui dit ""Qu'est-ce que t´as connard?""

Bonjour m´sieur directeur,
On vient relever les compteurs,
On va pas passer une heure à attendre les inspecteurs.
Assez parlé et passons aux choses sérieuse,
J´ai pas le temps de m´attarder, chaque secondes me sont précieuses!
Pendant qu´on est dans les temps, je m´occupe de l´argent de surface,
Du travail de pro, t´inquiète on laissera pas de trace,
Je remplis les sac à bloc, et là, la pourriture veille,
Si ça tourne au drame on va laisser des cervelles.
Direction la salles des coffres, j´emmène le directeur au sous-sol,
Mais là y a un petit problème, ce bâtard ne veux pas cracher le code,
Obligé de séquestré,y a refus d´obtempéré,
Il a fallu que je lui fasse montré des photos de sa femmes ligotée!
Je prend en otage 1 client qui a voulu faire le justicier
Canon sur la tempe on fais plus ça sinon je vais te tuer
Ça risquerais de finir en boucherie
Y a plus de temps a perdre on se dirige vers la sortie.
On monte les escaliers les sacs chargé
On peut y aller je crois que les gars on a touché un gros paquet de billets.
J´allais oublié je prend le directeur pour couvrir la fuite
Ce on vas le lâché sur le périf
Ok on se barre (on se barre) dans les sacs plus de 100 barres

Que j'aurais pu tout laisser tomber

Élève trop agité, qui n'en faisait qu'à sa tête

Eh mec, les devoirs, je les faisais tard le soir 
Et le matin pour me réveiller, c'était tout une histoire 
J'ai jamais eu une bonne entente avec l'éducation nationale

Dans des classes surchargées, 
Toujours les mêmes qui vont au piquet 
Arrivé en fin d'année, pour passer t'as pas ton ticket 
La conseillère, veut de toi se débarrasser 
T'orienter dans un truc auquel tu n'as même pas pensé 
Et en rang jamais rangé, combien de matières j'ai dû sécher 
Entre mes premiers rancarts et mon goût pour le danger 
J'aimais aussi l'E.P.S, pour mâter les seins des gonzes 
Question bizness, toujours un kilo de pièce 
J'ai terminé mes classes dans la rue où là j'étais le bienvenu 
Mais ici les heures de retenus, c'est 24 heures en garde à vue

Pour eux, mon avenir se trouvait au Baumet ou à la Santé
A grand coups de ballet, mes rêves se brisaient
Que dire à ces mômes, les yeux pleins de sympathie
Qui m'envient d'abord qui je suis
Une chose est sûre c'est que j'ai jamais voulu lâcher l'affaire
Ils m'ont mis la pression,
Pressés de me voir gicler les cours de Mr CENSON 
Mordu à l'hameçon, pour être le couillon parmi les cons 
Les insultes pleuvaient vers ce t'enculer de profs de MATHS 
Il fallait jamais me prier pour foutre l'ahyate 
Avec les années tous se gatte, merde

Il va même jusqu’à me dire qu´il a des cryptons à Matignon
Assez mignons, ceux qui passent à la télévision

Fille d´un père mafieux victime d´une vendetta
Il m’avait déconseillé d´faire des affaires avec Héroïne

Son truc c´était les afters, ambiance branchée façon Queen
Il me toucha 2, 3 mots sur un certain Monsieur Skunk
Un hollandais, apparemment qui lui devait des comptes
Mais il s´est pas rendu compte
Qu´il parle du mec qui m´accompagne

Prends cette arme on file de suite chez Madame Ecstasy
On a rancart avec elle dans son bar avec elle
Sa cousine LSD en mini jupe et en jarretelles
Je m´assois pour prendre un verre, putain, drôle de demoiselle
Et je regarde dans mon verre
Pour voir s´il y a rien dans la Heineken
Au moment même où ces filles nous racontent leur rave party

Deux de ses amis

Vêtu d´un gilet pare-balles et dans les mains un pe-pom
Qui sera le patron, à l´intérieur y a que des gros bonnets
Tous nez à nez, vu que mon pote vient de dégainer
Monsieur Cocaïne, à son tour braque Monsieur Popo
Monsieur Crack lui s´prive pas d´braquer Monsieur K-Skun
Et au milieu de tout ça dis-toi, j´ai du faire un choix
Liquider cette prostituée de Madame Ecsta
Et là démarrent les coups de fusil, Opium sort son Uzi
L´arrose d´une balle entre les yeux pour lui c´est robe de nuit
Skunk abat froidement Crack étant plus rapide que lui
LSD s´évanouit et Pop a des ennuis
C´est l´œuvre de Monsieur Cocaïne, il l´a touché dans le bras
Vu qu´y reste plus qu´moi et mes potos,
Il lève les mains on le qué-bra
Tout le monde va bien je crois Monsieur Skunk ça va

Ça reste grave dans nos mémoires, dans nos cœurs
On naît avec, on vit avec, on dort avec et on meurt avec, malheureusement
Cet album aussi, il est dédié à toutes les mères qui nous ont quitté
Que leur âme repose en paix
Que dieu veille sur vous, sur nous, sur nos familles, sur tout le monde
C'est ce qu'on souhaite, on n'oublie personne, on n'oublie personne

Laisse-moi porter tes sacs frère

Et lui m'a répondu ""Tu te crois encore ne métropole, garçon""
2, 3 jours après, je me suis mis dans le bain
Un petit caleçon de bain, pour les plages et les friapins

Colombo, court-bouillon poisson et cabritt
Pour fêter mon arrivée, seul, je suis parti zouker
Kolé serrer, sur le dernier tube de l'été
Touriste de passage ""Gué ti français la"" pour le voisinage
Et toujours cette question, ""Alors à quand le mariage?""
Cette manie de maquerellage, ça date depuis l'esclavage
Au temps de la rue Case-Nègre, les racines de mon village
J'étais venu pour me reposer, mon séjour trop mouvementé
Y avait trop de chose à faire j'ai pas vu le temps passer

Quand je suis arrivé on m'a dit ""Bienvenue au pays""

On fumait quand on partait en tournée dans chaque ville
Ou on passait ça faisait chaud au cœur
Comme ce concert à Oran ou au Antilles
Comment oublier j'ai jamais le blues grâce aux lettres des fans
Je vous ai pas oublié depuis l'11 mars j'ai rallumé la flamme
En direct de mon hall ma cellule où je vous tiens
En quelques mètres carrés et pour certains c'est devenu un domicile

En prison, rends fous les matons
Si t'es en auto accompagne ce son à coups de klaxon
Les gyrophares de keufs en guise de spots
Des scènes à immortaliser sur caméscope
A tous les étages de ta tour 
Un son à te faire griller les feux 
Sécher les cours comme Miss France 2001 
Délire bonhomme Hors limite à te faire

Ou comme au studio quand on bosse
Bouge la tête jusqu'au torticolis
Même grippé et malade on te sort du lit

Si t'es en discothèque, rentre dans le tas
Lève le doigt en l'air, fais le grand écart comme Travolta
Si tu vois flou et que tu rentres saoul
Lève la cuvette et comme Tiger Woods vise bien le trou

Et gros un cauchemar pour commissaire
Les mecs de ma génération vont ainsi,
Fuck l'insigne, un classique, un principe

Sur un starting block dès la naissance, on te dope
Avec de la merde on te botte, mon pote.
Ça arrive dans tous les sens, personne t'entend quand tu cries à l'aide
Quand on te balafre comme un zèbre et que t'es bruyant comme un Y.Z.
Chaque immeuble est comparable à une zone sismique
Le hall une micro entreprise où le futur licencié se pique.
Les murs de ma rue me parlent comme à tous ces types
Du jeu de frappe, ou de la braque spécialiste ou fanatique
Véhicule calciné comme monument
Les plats cuisinés par les mamans nous montrent à quel point le pays nous manque
On rampe comme des militaires,
On se percute comme au stock car on se nique, on s'humilie, on se rot-ca.

J'habite de l'autre côté de la rue, où ça?
Un cauchemar pour commissaire Broussard
Du mauvais côté du périph
Loin des contes féeriques
Confronté au périple, le moral pollué,
Toxique comme l'air, comme l'herbe

Tard le soir, rencontre du 3ème type
Face au contrôle de police, on met notre ruse en pratique
On n'est pas des chiens, tous dominants, tous patrons
Tout en ruminant dans nos gueules, je veux toucher le plafond
La rage c'est pas un truc qu'on recycle,
Au-delà du rap et de tout ce que je récite.
Ça revient chaque cycle c'est speed
La violence n'a pas pris une ride.
Entre crapule ça se liquide, avec une trêve à l'aïd.

Un polar, hommage aux disparus et aux courageux qui usine
A l'heure où le pire se manigance, genre attaque de fourgon ou Uzi.
Aucun salaire fixe, rien à déclarer au fisc
Le peu de fric, c'est pour l'hôtel où se déroulent des films X
T'es fixé, au poste pression caniculaire,
Un mélange voyou populaire, témoin oculaire et père en colère
On gamberge vite comme un avion furtif.
C'est la rillette ou le vice, surveille nos actions et le cours du cannabis
La Havana ou Pattaya comme péché mignon
Heineken pour madame qui ne connaît pas le Dom Pérignon.
Les coffres sautent, mecs en planque ou en fuite, biz de coke ou de plante.
Les balles te rasent on te plombe une rotka on te plante
Y a qu'une saison des plans on solo ou à 30.
La BAC tourne comme un sample et moi je chante
Car d'autres sont sur un casse, les plus effrontés on cage.
Oublie ceux qui t'enfoncent, pense à ceux qui t'encouragent
Du lundi au dimanche folie comme divertissement
On rit au nez des avertissements et des jugements
Et quand les voisins sourient pas, ils parlent pas, m'en parle pas
Le gros y connaît pas, il renseigne pas.
Vu nos différences raciales dans tout ça, on tient le coup
Et si un jour la chance se présente, on tente tout.

Une pensée pour ceux qu'ont perdu leurs parents.
Maman n'est plus toute jeune aussi, c'est la seule femme que j'aime.
Comme tous les parents du monde, ils m'ont vu avocat ou médecin
Toujours un enfant à leurs yeux, trop de fois je suis absent
Je crève l'abcès de l'amour,
Comme ceux qui ont mal tourné, parce qu'on les as détournés.
Les conseils de la famille,
C'est l'exemple de mes parents que je retiens pour que demain soit OK.
J'ai su me prendre en main pour chaque journée.
C'est comme un contrat qu'on a signé,
J'ai jamais insulté mon père ni ma mère, toujours le respect.
En tournée, je me sens loin de vous,
Mais sachez que mon cœur est toujours là près de vous
Il y a votre sang, il y a votre chair, mon ciment
Il y a l'Afrique, vous êtes ma terre, mon continent.

Trop de fois j'ai troublé vos nuits de sommeil,
Mais je vide mon mal, de vous à moi
Trop de fois, on ignore ce qu'on détient,
C'est le cœur qui parle, c'est le cœur qui parle.

Trop de fois j'ai troublé vos nuits de sommeil,
Mais je vide mon mal, de vous à moi
Trop de fois, on ignore ce qu'on détient,
C'est le cœur qui parle, c'est le cœur qui parle.

Y a rien de plus précieux, mon petit frère, ma petite sœur, ma mère, je garde sous les yeux.
Je me sens coupable, coupé du monde, dès que je te vois souffrir.
Je m'excuse en chanson, maman, je tenais à te dire, la nuit, le plus souvent
J'y pense à chaque fois, tous ces moments où nous étions en froid, rappelle toi.
J'étais peut-être trop naïf, trop jeune pour comprendre,
Alors qu'il suffisait d'en parler pour s'en-tendre.
C'est douloureux mais la famille y a rien de plus précieux.
Mon petit frère, ma petite sœur, je garde sous les yeux.
Ils sont si jeunes, des fois je chiale comme ma mélodie.
Mon cœur a faibli comme frappé par une maladie
J'ai des lésions internes, je suis un homme, ça devrait aller.
Tous ces mots montrent à quel point nous sommes liés.
Près du béton, du sol, où je suis l'aîné, je suis pas le seul
J'en connais le salaire, le soir quand je rentre seul.
Y aura toujours des cris et des larmes,
Succéderont les sourires qui réchaufferont nos armes
Pour refaire place aux fou rires.

Trop de fois j'ai troublé vos nuits de sommeil,
Mais je vide mon mal, de vous à moi
Trop de fois, on ignore ce qu'on détient,
C'est le cœur qui parle, c'est le cœur qui parle.

Trop de fois j'ai troublé vos nuits de sommeil,
Mais je vide mon mal, de vous à moi
Trop de fois, on ignore ce qu'on détient,
C'est le cœur qui parle, c'est le cœur qui parle.

Quelques lignes en guise d'excuses,
Prends ta mère dans tes bras, gros, fais lui une grosse bise.
A la femme la plus courageuse du monde
Tout comme toi j'aimerais avoir du cœur et être aussi croyant que mon père
On n'a pas eu la même jeunesse, Dieu sait que depuis que je sais lire et écrire
J'ai pas connu la guerre mais presque, j'ai connu Vitry.
Quelques lignes en guise d'excuses, pour la paix de l'esprit, je paye le prix
C'est mon père qui me l'a appris, avec un grand frère comme soutient
Des sœurs qui n'ont jamais déshonorer la famille
Et à qui je tiens des deux êtres que j'ai pas toujours écouté
Certes de moi-même je suis dégoûté, parfois dérouté
En espérant que Dieu et ma famille vous me pardonnez.
Inch'Allah, je viendrai à bout de vos soucis.
Après tout ce que vous avez subi, je vous souhaite une longue vie
Je tiens à vous l'avoir dit,
Avant que vous écoutiez ceci de la part d'un homme, votre fils",La Familia,2002

Depuis l'époque Beloumi et Madjar.

Mon autoradio volé, toujours une cassette de Renaud ou d'Aznavour.
Conduite nocturne en état d'ivresse en 16S.
Un contrôle de police et je fais péter l’alcootest
Je refuse jamais une bagarre à mains nues ou au tourne-vis.
Connu des mioches ou des vigiles de Leclerc, fils.
Je raconte aux filles pleins de conneries.

Dans les petites provinces où on barbait tout.

C'est mon morceau je fais ce que je veux, qui veut test le loubard?
Je suis dans tous les petits boulots, le préféré des petites vieilles
Le mécano, toujours les mains dans les calots.

Je sais plus, en tout cas personne n'a dormi.

En tapant un rail ou à faire le con sur les railles à la gare 
Pour se retrouver devant la barre, 
Jusqu’à stopper par une brigade qui s'envergonne défouraille
10 minutes chrono pour se retrouver au bout du rouleau ou dans le bon filon, 
Refiler des stocks bourrer de kilos ou vider le coffre d'une banque au culot 
Pour prendre un billet d'avion et filer loin 
Comme Nicolas Hullot pour des rouleaux d'euros
On n'est pas frilleux on a le prix nobel des rebelles
On est des filloux des foullets
10 minutes chrono pour émerger au réveil 
Une fraction de secondes pour te manger un pruneau ou faire un tonneau

Ça sent mauvais quand t'entends les corbeaux
Tout peut basculer d'une minute à l'autre 10 minutes chrono
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno
Ou devant un coffre qui pèse trop lourd
Chut pas un mot si on coince si on pince on est pas ronds
Ça peut basculer d'une minute à l'autre 10 minutes chrono haha
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno
Ou devant un coffre qui pèse trop lourd

10 minutes chrono pour prendre ta douche en cage, 
Pour faire ton pactage ou après un gros coup 
Pour faire le partage pour rafler le pactole
Toutes les 10 minutes passe une patrouille 
Dans ma banlieue y a pas de puits de pétrole
Pour duper les caméras de surveillance 
Y a plus grand chose qui nous épate, on a un mental en métal
10 minutes chrono pour tout perdre aux cartes
Savourer un joint du Népal ou à la bourse pour couler tes finances
10 secondes pour qu'un videur te recale en boîte et te déboîte 
Faut pousser la bête, la navette, enfiler la veste à capuche 
10 minutes chrono pour toucher un crépus en visant le foie,
Plus 1 fois 10 minutes pour creuser un trou à la pelle dans un bois 
Se qu'on à a faire on le repousse jamais à redois
Escalade sur les toits on parle peut-être de toi
10 minutes chrono pour que ma clique soit aux abois
Pour beaucoup moins que ça on te fume si tu laisses une ardoise derrière toi

Ça sent mauvais quand t'entends les corbeaux
Tout peut basculer d'une minute à l'autre 10 minutes chrono
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno
Ou devant un coffre qui pèse trop lourd

Ça peut basculer d'une minute à l'autre 10 minutes chrono haha
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno
Ou devant un coffre qui pèse trop lourd

Des fois y a un flic, y a ton cœur qui palpite
Essaye de semer les flics sur les voies rapides c'est le temps qu'il te faut
Pour accoler une racli, pour vider une bombe lacrymogène à un CRS
Pour une petite gâterie, pour manger un mafé, charger les batteries
On a les crocs de la cons' et on boit le sky en Paris à Vitry
On est pas kho, on veut vite grimper
On est conscient qu'on peut y rester ou regretter
En 10 minutes chrono pour que le juge t'acquitte ou te mettre perpètre
Pour qu'une bande te taquine ou te rackette
Pour couper une plaquette
4 secondes chrono, hé pou-cave pour connaître ta tête
Pour prendre la poudre d’escampette pour régler une transac'
Trimbaler un gros sac pour le compte d'un gros sac sans pitié
10 minutes chrono pour quitter le pays, le quartier
Juste 10 minutes pour pas se faire allumer
Pour pouvoir partir en entier ou faire cracher le banquier

Ça sent mauvais quand t'entends les corbeaux
Tout peut basculer d'une minute à l'autre 10 minutes chrono
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno

Écoute pendant que ton string sèche, fluide est mon clan

Je vis sur le cran d'arrêt
Me demande pas à quoi sert une maison d'arrêt
Les jaloux disent qu'on meure bientôt à ce qu'il parait
Ma vie de nombreux périples
Je prends le fric des MC qui à chaque sortie du périphérique
Appelle à tous les gores faut qu'on s'alourdisse
Je prépare des trucs horribles dans ma catégorie
On veut me tester sur mon terrain sans aucune descente

Contrôlé à chaque feu pas déguisé pour rentrer en boîte

Je m'appelle Rim-K alias Dédé, dans le quartier tout le monde me connaît.
Je connais les rues comme si je les avais faites, je suis la cerise sur le ghetto.
Je traîne toujours dans le même bar avec les mêmes roulures, les mêmes loubards.
Depuis que j'ai la télé en couleur, en embrouille avec mon rasoir,
Depuis l'époque Beloumi et Madjar.
Je vis, ça me suffit, y a peu de choses que je savoure
Mon autoradio volé, toujours une cassette de Renaud ou d'Aznavour.
Conduite nocturne en état d'ivresse en 16S.
Un contrôle de police et je fais péter l’alcootest
Je refuse jamais une bagarre à mains nues ou au tourne-vis.
Connu des mioches ou des vigiles de Leclerc, fils.
Je raconte aux filles pleins de conneries.
Je mange aux crêpes en pastiche, eh l'aziz, devant les pompes à essence de nuit
Et gros, je me barre, j'enfile un jeans,
Après avoir passer une heure au chiotte avec un magazine.

Toujours un peu crasseux sur les bords
Je crache, je ro-te, je me censure.
Tord boyaux et pollen, quand je suis sage, Minute Maid.
Je traîne qu'avec des Mamadou et des Mohamed
Je suis bousillé comme mon interphone,
Tu m'as bien vu, tard le soir dans la rue
Je suis pris au sérieux par Interpole.

C'est pas le titre d'un film tout pourri de banlieue

Quand y a du grabuge, je mes la capuche,
L'écharpe pour les manifs
Grand dieu, rend grâce au taxi baskets et aux petits week-ends avec les sounds de quartiers
Dans les petites provinces où on barbait tout.
Ça rime pas, je m'en fous,
C'est mon morceau je fais ce que je veux, qui veut test le loubard?
Je suis dans tous les petits boulots, le préféré des petites vieilles
Le mécano, toujours les mains dans les calots.
Quand je m'ennuie, un jour j'étais en garde-à-vue, pourquoi?
Je sais plus, en tout cas personne n'a dormi.
Un clando, roi du poker, de la Playstation et de la 103 SP,
Je marche bancal et je parle sans respect.
J'aime bien les films de Bruce Lee,
J'ai testé la prise sur un mec, je lui ai pété la mâchoire.
Deux mois de purée Mousline.
Ecris à la baraque en chaus-sons.

Briser le cercle de la famille mia
C’est impensable liés par la chair le sang de l’amour véritable.

Chapitre 1
L’aîné de la famille, bientôt 30ans,
Trafiquant de drogue semé farine éparpillés sur Paris,
Klak ses dividendes avec des timpes accueillies en maître en boite.
Ingérable par le chef de famille,
A 300km sur la route de l’enfer puis viens le tremblement de terre,
Bouchon de tôle pour le grand frère.
Sa petite sœur son petit trésor lui manquera,
Venir le voir ou lui écrire ça elle y manquera pas,
Mais nous on va pas le revoir de sitôt.
En centrale dégaine de toxico dernier parloir il perdait ses chicos.

Chapitre 2
C'est l’inverse de son frelo,
Bosseur, modeste, sportif,
À 2 doigts d’entrer a Claire fontaine qui respecte son père ses sœurs à cause de son frère.
Sa mère sous ante-dépresseurs, le bitume t’en connaît l’épaisseur?

Chapitre 3
Allons faire un tour chez la plus grande des sœurs éblouie par un amour d’jeunesse,
Débordée de promesses jusqu'à lui faire 2 gosses et comme une merde il la délaisse.
Depuis 2 ans divorcée, elle sait plus ou mettre la tête,
Des dettes, du retard sur les loyers, les charges.
T’éduques pas des gosses avec des allocs!
Le plus grand de ses 2 fistons lui ramène déjà des sales notes. 

Chapitre 4
Revenons à la petite protégée de la famille
Qui aimerait voir autour d’une grande table tout le monde réuni,
Aide la mama aux taches ménagères.
Les profs ravis par son travail pourtant parasité
Par ce qui se passe dans le cercle familial 

Chapitre 5
Le chapitre le plus long, une mère épuisée par les ragots,
Le regard des gens souvent en sanglots,
Le cœur criblé par les problèmes.
Jamais reposée, Mama est forte de caractère,
Marre de s’interposer entre lui et ses gosses.
Ici la vie est moins dure qu’au pays mais la tentation est plus grosse,
Elle ferait tout pour leur bonheur comme leur père ces temps-ci
Déstabilisé par la grand-mère qui attend son heure.
Leur père, un ouvrier comme on en fait plus,
Jamais de plainte, se tue à la tache, les temps changent, fusent.
Ce vieux couple à du mal à suivre les comportements racistes
 Une fille exclue socialement, un fils aux assises,
Les soucis qui rongent les neurones.
C’est à se poser des questions
En choisissant la France a-t-on tirer le bon N°?
Il tient les rênes tant bien que mal, toujours souriant,
Les ennuis dissimulés loin au fond du crâne

Dernier chapitre de notre story
Conscient que la vie c’est pas tout noir ou tout blanc.
Tous préparés à en payer le tarif, où est l’essentiel?
Rester soudés fait au moins honneur a celle qui t'as couvé.
Être une épaule solide sur laquelle le père peut s’appuyer.
La vie nous joue des sales tours. Remercie Dieu chaque jour!

La femme bien? Les enfants bien? » Le cercle familial!

Qui aiment la vie mais celle-ci leur a fait un baiser mortel
Quelques rimes que tu peux comparer aux larmes du soleil
Un jour de paix, tant qu'y'aura des hommes et des femmes qui s'aiment
Mon cœur c'est pas une télécommande
Nous on veut tous une femme présente, même dans la tourmente
Chacun regagne son domicile, comme les tranchées

Un jour de paix pour nos fils,
Un jour de paix pour nos filles,
Un jour sans que tout parte en vrille,
Un jour sans pleurs, sans haine, sans peur, sans peines
Un jour où tombe Babylone system

J'suis un être humain comme tout l'monde
J'm'arrête aux choses sensibles,
Tu sais que même avec le temps les plus rebelles s'assagissent
J'veux voir d'la joie au lieu d'la haine dans les yeux des gens
J'ai d'la peine quand j'regarde les infos, et vois c'qui s'passe sur notre continent
J'vis là où les jours s'confondent avec la nuit,
Là où aussi on laisse peu d'chances aux plus démunis,
Aux orphelins qui retrouvent l'amour dans un foyer secondaire,
Dès leur enfance, bercés par la colère d'un père
Toutes nos valeurs sont écoulées dans les unes
Une violence urbaine au milieu des nôtres
Rêve d'une terre sans discriminations, sans conflits,
Tend la main à ceux dans la solitude
Comme ce p'tit paralysé sur un lit, qu'on voit qu'le bonheur ce second souffle
Y'a des gens qui souffrent, et qui font pas semblant
Pour tous les pays en guerre, j'agite le drapeau blanc
Baissez les armes, séchez vos larmes pour un jour de paix c'est maintenant

Si la paix pouvait embrasser ce monde juste un jour,
Une trêve, une pause pour que l'on sache après quoi on court
Sait-on encore c'que signifie l'amour?
J'ai bien peur que non, Dieux nous le montrent tous les jours
La planète tourne à l'envers, ça m'fait peur,
Voyez vous les flammes de l'enfer frères et sœurs
Ne lui vendez pas vos âmes.

Comment rester insensible?
La violence déborde, changer l'attitude de l'être humain est-ce possible?
Comment rester insensible?

Elle savait ce qu’il allait ce produire.
Ce soir était un soir ou la nuit lui appartenait.
Précieusement, charnue de désirs elle s’était glissée dans un bain chaud et impudique.
Avec précaution elle avait parfumé son corps de crème.
Elle savait que ce soir elle mettrait toutes ses valeurs dans le tiroir de sa mémoire.
Nez de clown, rouge.

Elle l’avait appelé.
Un café? Il avait répondu oui, il savait ce qu’il faisait.
Deux adultes. Deux adultes mais si enfantins, tellement seuls.
Personne ne saurait. Tuer le temps ensemble, ballon rouge.
Ils ne s’aimaient pas vraiment d’amour,
Ils aimaient être ensemble et partager des joies,
Des peines et soulager leurs désirs charnels.
Rien de plus, tristement.

Chez lui, un café, des paroles.
Des flots de paroles pour éviter tous regards.
Pour fuir des désirs, des envies. Un café.
Des secrets confiés, échangés. Banal.
Nez rouge, un soir fugace.

Puis il est l’heure de se séparer.
Lui offre un cadeau, elle sensible sens qu’une tension monte.
Il la raccompagne.
Et dans la voiture une phrase «j’ai envie de t’embrasser» déclenche un torrent de passion.
Trop longtemps retenu.
Pas de tapis rouge.

Avidement les lèvres se rencontrent, avidement des mains s’évadent.
Une chaleur se dégage.
Lui, plein de désir sous des mains câlines,
Elle, pleine de désirs sous des mains fouilleuse.
Plus rien ne les retient, la nuit les drape.
La nuit les couvre. Une jupe est remontée à la hâte.
Dans cette folie,
Une seule jambe de collant est enlevée
Pour offrir un sexe gonflé de désir une main glisse à l’intérieur,
Des cuisses chaudes de promesses.
Ballon rouge. Plus rien ne les arrête.

Le siège de la voiture se couche.
Puis lentement, délicieusement chacune des quatre mains déshabille l’autre.
Des baisers avides déchaînent deux corps demande.
Puis, les deux corps s’unissent, s’accouplent.
Tendrement, il pénètre en elle.
Tendrement il la pénètre.
Elle se cabre, l’invitant à rester, l’invitant à se donner.
Sans amour. Tout devient vivant.
Tout devient douleur.
De légers tressaillement envahissent les corps des deux amants.
Impudique dans leurs chairs, ils s’abandonne l’un dans l’autre.
Ils se donnent sans compter.
Ils prennent, ils donnent. Ils prennent.
Fulgurant de haine envers elle, elle joue à l’épanouie.
Le pastique du ballon rouge grince. 
Ballon rouge éclaté, tapis rouge enroulé, nez rouge de clown. 
C’est fini la tempête des sentiments charnels.
Chacun se rhabille mine de rien, mine de tout.
Pas un mot. Pas une promesse, pas un mot d’amour.
Que soulager des envies. La voiture démarre.
Tout est fini. Ne rien dire. 
Ballon rouge et vide grenier. 
Un au revoir, lancé à la hâte.

Demain elle reprendra un bain pour un amant lointain
Miroir ne triche pas, l’odeur qu’elle regarde pue.
Elle sait, le jeu est dégueulant de tristesse.
Une nouvelle histoire courte d’un jour,
Pour ne pas croire.
Mais dans un ventre trop lourd de secret,
Elle continuer son chemin vers une fin sans parole.

Les flics rêvent de te péter pendant que tu dors
Alors tu prends tes jambes à ton cou t'as vu à la télé Diddy
Tu veux mener la même vie que lui

Rapide à la David Villa
Grosses caisses et grandes villas

Parfois un tarot à l'ancienne pour les connaisseurs
Je la joue en finesse pendant des heures
Un brin de charmeur, te catche de voleur
Pas besoin qu'on me pistonne, ce soir c'est open
Y a les princes, les princesses, la G-Funk
Le D.J sort les pièces, les vinyles blancs
On est sur un plan, rare comme Michael sans ses gants

C'est old school dans le sang, c'est le son des anciens
On a le vécu et le franc parler, ne pousser pas dans le fond
Les 0.6, on les récupère par 5
17 pouces en métal, c'est moi qui régale
C'est de la haute gamme, indémodable comme Rekbal
Dans les poumons, j'ai du propane
Je rate la barre

Avec ou sans les potes
Avec ou sans les
J'ai le délire de reur-ti
Je t'attends à la sortie
Avec ou sans l'oseille
J'avoue, c'est pas pareil
J'ai remis le G-Funk à l'ancienne, à l'ancienne

Je me lève quand je kiffe, c'est la devise
Y a pas de trucages, c'est la deuxième prise
Le petit Lacoste, mains dans les poches, toujours assorti
Fais briller les enjoliveurs, je suis de sortie
Un dernier pas, je lève la tête, je suis dans l'espace
Fais pas le radin, fais croquer, fais la passe
C'est le week-end, on est des phénomènes
Ils kiffent la G-Funk, les spécimens

Quand ta meuf te grille, tu bé-bégaye
Fais pas le voyou à l'arrière d'un siège bébé
La trentaine, endurcit, official
Les endroits fashion, c'est les chichas
On est les enfants de la G-Funk
Handek, y a la sono qu'a pris feu
Ma vie est au milieu d'un cercle vicieux
Je paies avec l'oseille des cercles de jeu

Avec ou sans les potes

J'ai remis le G-Funk à l'ancienne, à l'ancienne

Je suis avec mes potes, on est bien
On se bousille sur le refrain
On reconnaît les abonnés
Avec ou sans la maille, c'est toujours eux les premiers

Excités comme des écoliers
Chemise Vuitton en damier
C'est nous les tôliers
Jamais mon collier en grain de café

J'ai remis la G-Funk à l'ancienne, à l'ancienne

Je suis un all black je te plaque comme au rugby
Pour ouvrir le coffre faut le code ou un outil
Essaie de lire dans mes pupilles
Je tourne comme le mécanisme du Breitling
Ma musique te gonfle le torse comme la créatine
On achète pas on fabrique on est de l'école du trafic
Sans demander ton avis a ta table on s'invite

Wanna see the Common in me
And since it's a senseless contradiction
I end up a misfit trying fit in
This ends when I stand up
And see the hands that are standard
Holy is the lamb (Holy is the Lamb)
Now we holding you to man up 'cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from.

Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make
Adamant after what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree and Eden,
If you read it you'd see that Eve was deceived,
But Adam's the one who let her eat it (Man up)
Standing leading no, we ain't leading we (Bump that)
Basically little boys with muscles and a mustache!
The femininity, we need a remedy that God made a
100 percent masculinity

We the last, yeah
Where the men at, seems like they all lost,
None of them are on the scene, seems like they died off.
They extinct but my dream is to rise up,
We chasing the prize of the King, the divine boss,
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi,
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me.
Fellas let's elevate, we through with the lies man.

They lie, go ahead say boy get your shine on
If a sucker try to block you get your 9 on
And what I heard you gotta do to be a man now,
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now.
And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, boy drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man 'cause you feeling yourself
You need to man up!

Sex and models and tippin' bottles
Pack a pile of excuses right next to your bottle caps 
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money buildin' up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck, givin' jokers the cold shoulder 
You drunk off pride plus you loving the hangover
You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain 
Life will never make sense because you never made change  

We got it twisted, sick like a fever
Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up out of that treehouse
Leave them cookies alone, it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, you can call it a freestyle 
Without Christ you won't know what a man is
You a boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in Big

Being a man got nothin' to do with age
You can be a boy 'til the day you lay in your grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made 
'Cause we fallen the ways it's better known as depraved 
Running from responsibility really we crave
The easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they blowing through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving 'em from the gate

Man up!
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men
Man up!
Doesn't matter how you started partner, it's about how you end
Man up!
Jesus is the model follow us we go follow him

Sees the sun going down

12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2002

It's nine-six I'm a bang you with some hits
In two-thousand six I got my son makin' hits
A nine to five it's a job to survive
F--k the lies and connives and all them company bribes

I'm Family Ties for my seeds I'd die
I want the whole f--kin pie save them slice for eighty-fives
And besides, see I never had a million
Got beefs that got millions and in buy-outs worth billions

Knotty n-gga with a plan platinum jam
Found a million fans in the Lexus to the Lands
So whose the cat in the comfy black Ac?
As a matter of fact, I sick/six fingers I'm from fat

My projects be the livest that it gets
Watch me ---- back Tex and do murders in the backsteps
I want that be	---h with a Lex, a house out in New Mex
She disrespect, she buys a Rolex

12 O'Clock sells you stock business
Drive in Benzes, see my dog were tremendous
In case I didn't mention
I'm killin' your whole startin' team and all them n----z on the benches

So please play your distance
I'm givin a sentence that pull more pain than a dentist
Most def, I'm professional

Show me lies, suck my beach
I got fans in Puerto Rico that love what I throw

Jubilant cats they keep pagin' me
Peace what's the signs ock?
Fruit of life like the apricot

Cocktails tossin' em at cops on blocks
Park Hillian, drug hillbillies made billions
Get a gun, kidnap, eight nine Jimmyians
Yo, he had about this amount in his Swiss account

Gunnin' this out we reminisce on this beh's house
Back in time, was a bad fiend
Now I flex mad green get cream seven-fifty n----l gleam
Say hi to chocolate t--I f----d lives

Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'ma inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Fuck, shit up on the hurry up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowin' niggaz back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill

Hit you with the blast

Raise the fear, no one, but self, who's shook?
Bring the plague like the revelations in the holy book

Don't matter what crew, every last one of 'em

I better meal my deal, my career with no fear
That none of ya'll group can touch what's over here

So what, looked up and made the bitches clap
That was because my style's clothes, not the raps
Ain't that shit, props for the clothing
Should of brought a mirror, cuz lyric wasn't rollin'
My rhymes is all that and yours ain't shit
And at a party, your bitch takin' crazy flicks of me
She said I was nigga celebrity
But I'm from the slums, with the bums drinkin' Hennesey
Take a sip of some Jamaican rum
Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns
Make fools out of bitches like I'm Howard Stern

Karma
What goes around comes around right? (right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They gonna slap you back (yer)
Sometimes it hurts
And that's bad karma
Watch out for it

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed
Well I guess I'll have to live day to day
and pray to god that'll I'll be ok, ay ay

[Verse 1]
These fat raps think they fit like they The Iron Man
I got the iron tongue and the iron hand
I make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet so switch the picture
If ya, look in the mirror you bound to get a reflection
Like with, every action there is a reaction
with your, dodgy actions you causing negative drama
And if you know gods law you best watch for karma
Now I'm a bomb ya
Running your traps like tacks
You think you floating on the cream
You and your rat pack
While I'm take that thought back now lets dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and (you's a matador)
I'm seeing red
(You outta swords)
I'm a target like
(Dartsboards)
You floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first while ya shakin I cut off like
umbilicals at birth

[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I look around the city and its all such a pity
everybody trying to be pretty don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block nobodys playing hopscotch
there to busy on the internet surfing that rap

[Verse 3]
Just converse kind of rude like
(so what you trying to prove mate)
I say, (nothing I'm just trying to build the feeling I live like you)
I got plans to take this city up to senate
As lifes one big race and want all entrys to win it
If your not with it, like quitters then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
Your a disgrace with a desire
You need to recon through your fire and look higher higher! look around!
I got sounds that help you get down so you can get up
But oh boy i'm sick of raps that get me fed up
Yer they make me want to throw up cause they gotta grow up
But well I'll be feeling a beard and I'll be Sailing like NOAH

Perth.....Adelaide.... Tassy

Picture on the quota its time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall so
I got a key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And when I unlock the door I'm bringing love to my people
unlike these Fickle Fanatics that want to cause death
cut holes flake praying we fall to hells depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
as what goes up comes down never the less
We're stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
boomerang effect as we all face our karma

His daddy ran off with some broad from the Motown
When momma said ""we're leavin tomorrow""
Jimmy already had his things together

So many days of thinking of the past
The girl he left behind and hanging out in the free streets
Somehow Jimmy had survived his reflections
The broken glass in his hands, a noose before him

Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix and a bottle and he won't complain
Until he's blue in the face

Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson?
You always know what you were missing
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem?
Just a kid with no direction

Some people say it was fright that drove him
But Jimmy knows who's really scared of difference
The whipping boy won't take his beating
It only leaves them alone to their thinking

Of how he knew what they could never know
And he would live and learn
To be himself through his mistakes
Watch and laugh, pretend they were okay
Waiting for things to change is just another day

Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix or a bottle and he won't complain

Yes everyday I fall

And you find yourself longing for a certain drastic context
A dreadful circumstance that will tack great lengths onto your dictionary definition

To soothe your leaden understanding of bread, water, and money
Now arriving by an alternate route at where the absence of such things might leave you
Mind you, this is not more rich confession of a child actor
And as you would agree completely with a gift cyst as it appeared in your throat
And delight your tiny heart a moment with uncontested omnipresence will...

You stretch the pen and cheat the sleep

Tying them off with an x axis c-clamp
And setting them down

You've sewn a cloth copy of your nervous system
To a turtle neck and pair tux pants
Outside the city's dry all covered in primer
You have lost control of you hair
Yesterday you were shot for a magazine cover
Fatigue swapped your body build with all urge and by the door
You heard demo's creaking squeezing a squeal from your guilt against the clinging teeth of their CD-tray
All beneath the inner half of the door knob
Hissing at its other head
Hung in the sun

You're staring at a quill as the lump sum of its parts
And it's begun to look brutal

4 walls of day: and that alone
No empty hallway for you bearing the 100 bright light blocking doors of luck
And here in the favor of life I will
Contrive no device against expectation, only announce
I have learned to respect the color yellow
For one reason or another
And in the insurmountable non strength of one's weight

Out toward dead wee-hour isles.

has the earth come loose from its galactic neck beneath you.
Cut off above the clouds
Gone let go from the space surround it
Dropped down done to the sun system's floor

Cleaved, fell rolling toward a corner of the cosmos

So haven't dreamt and heavily armed
Yet another blues thief told in however and oneday...

and every Monday things begin with indiscriminate street noise
More vague and normal alliance of all those with high levels of work
In their blood and clock in their wake
Up early shaving damp breakfast skulls with fresh lady's leg razor
So that the oneday the moon might hold a half million nice size
Hoods easy
And plenty fast restaurants

And laid low into creature

Depressed and kept from quite some cold ago,
And they look brave, dangerous, man made

And set it up over by the printer and horsehead
Obsessed with your pressing record
To indulge in the shadows of both here and immortal

is it god to name things from thin air
To have the wind blow a few hundred dollar bills into your wallet

to have 100 cc's liquid luck supplement
Dug into your blood
By needle point and distant star

are you busy losing yourself
In the quiet cell of abandoned old oakland
Pants undone, stole eye starting to water
Nailing a sign that speaks fear to a bank at the man made lake

you cop you

will you now resort to black umbrellas in the sight blanching sun
Or stay indoors taking the pill to your face...

striking that lightning on nothing
Attempting to teach yourself the art of cloning at home
In a smock killing single cell sheep for straight weeks
'til you give it all up for photoshop and using your teeth

there in a box with your things, stabbed airholes, and one wing
Or white lung, when your well will you stay

Going the distance on songs for somebody else's compilation.

You have the desperate fair to your eyes
The look of a child who has just swallowed a coin or army man
Almost too attuned to the spoils of loved
Wishing he'd been born some sort of succulent or larvae
But you're too soft for all that
You like your blood kept in the movies
And your head in a jar or a vase in a van on tour
Your guts clumped like dung in a sturdy hatbox
Heart slung safely in the stomach of a clean sock or two
Here you are a bag of milk to do tricks
And not as a function of pennies

13 Winters,"An emptiness seems to fade as I walk in the fog.
I hunger for the darkness, my only will in life.
Wind blows leaves on the ground,
Autumn surrounds me with it's beauty.
I gather myself where I'm not found,
to gaze into the midnight sky.

I try for once to forget everything in my life.
To be at ease with with my tortured mind.
To hide my sorrow that grows inside.
To be by myself, DEAD TO THE WORLD!

I've hated myself for a long,
I need to let the pain out.
Make my mind subside in the light of the Full Moon.

Burning leaves fill the cold air, wrap myself into me.
I want the night to set my heart free.
Will this night comfort me?

Tears fall down my face,
for something can't be placed.
A hold that can;t be filled,
a giant hole inside me.

Will this Autumn night set me free, 
to embrace me with it's beauty?
To comfort me with its full glory?
In this season I feel no misery.",Autumn,2004
1349,"As time floats by I'm stuck
On this point of no return
The world, a stage upon which
A neural play unfolds
Flickering by in shades of grey
Permeated by absurdity
Like a glossy polished reality
Slowly fading into oblivion

Unconscious but aware
Awake, yet dreaming
Alive, still limbonic
Awaiting the libreration

The fallen angel of Doom appears
I behold his fury in fear
Disguised he enters the play
Fulfilling the obscurity
I see the stage crumble
I see the curtains fall
The final act begins
As death reveals it's disguise

Escaping mankind, escaping doom
Outrun (the) fear, outrun Death
Heading for the promised land
To gain immortality
Let the play of liberation begin anew

The circle is ended
A new play begins
No need to witness
Know the end
Let all fears go by
Drift into oblivion",Liberation,2003

Foi assim, como ver o mar
A primeira vez que meus olhos
Se viram no seu olhar
Não tive a intenção de me apaixonar
Mera distração e já era
Momento de se gostar
Quando eu dei por mim
Nem tentei fugir do visgo que me prendeu
Dentro do seu olhar
Quando eu mergulhei no azul do mar
Sabia que era amor
E vinha pra ficar
Daria pra pintar todo o azul do céu
Dava pra encher o universo
Da vida que eu quis pra mim
Tudo que eu fiz foi me confessar
Escravo do seu amor
Livre pra amar
Quando eu mergulhei fundo nesse olhar
Fui dono do mar azul
De todo o azul do mar
Foi assim, como ver o mar
Foi a primeira vez que eu vi o mar
Onda azul, todo o azul do mar
Daria pra beber todo o azul do mar
Foi quando mergulhei no azul do mar...

A vida me fez assim
Doce ou atroz, manso ou feroz
Eu, caçador de mim
Preso a canções
Entregue a paixões que nunca
Tiveram fim
Vou me encontrar longe do meu lugar
Eu, caçador de mim
Nada a temer
Senão o correr da luta
Nada a fazer
Senão esquecer o medo
Abrir o peito à força
Numa procura
Fugir às armadilhas da meta escura
Longe se vai sonhando demais
Mas onde se chega assim
Vou descobrir o que me faz sentir

De querer te abraçar
De correr pela areia

Nos meus olhos tanta coisa
Pressentida de você
Abro a janela inda que tarde
Vejo a cidade
Meu olhar sempre na estação
Na partida do trem
Se esconde no abandono das aldeias
Minha voz fora do tempo
Conta estórias vindas da selva
Despertando outra cor no céu
Do luar do sertão
Não, não há por detrás dessas serras, nasce
Qual chuva de prata
Clareando no chão
Despertando o dia em seu berço
Abro a janela, inda que tarde
Vejo a cidade
Meu olhar sente o nosso adeus
Na partida do trem
Ouço no caminho dos trilhos bate
Aquele refrão que não esconde você
Do abandono das aldeias

Conta estórias vindas da selva
Despertando outra cor no céu
Do luar do sertão

18 Karat,"Ah, ich mach's mir auf der Hantelbank bequem
Mit Gewichten, die sonst nur ein Gabelstapler hebt
Auf der Straße hab ich fame, ich mach' G-Rap mit Flow
Für ein' Rear Naked Choke ist mein Bizeps zu groß
Ah, ich mach' der Sängerin Ciara Kids
Und danach fick ich eine Bitch, und zwar Sierra Kidds
Kurz darauf hat die Bitch in ihrem Hintern Penis drin
Und ich 'ne Anzeige - Verführung von Minderjährigen
Bin im Zerlegen King und geh' ich scheißen in 'nem Zug
Bringt es mir mehr als eine Seite in der JUICE
Und warum sich die Kugeln in deiner Brust befinden
Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort im Bus ganz hinten
Hunde, die bellen, beißen nicht, sagen ein paar im Viertel
Doch Hunde, die bellen, werden am meisten gefürchtet
Asphalt Massaka, der Pate 5, Bitch
2 Milionen Euro, mein Jahresrückblick

Asphalt Massaka, die Trilogie, ich steche dir in deine Givenchy
Ich hab gehört, dass du in Wien auf krass Kanake da machst
Aber in Deutschland bleibst du 'ne Fliege, wie'n Krawattenersatz
Alles Fotzen, außer KC Danke für die Props
Und diese Aussage, doch ihr bleibt Fotzen, ohne Ausnahme
Die Fans haben es gemerkt, dass ihr Heuchler seid
Ihr habt null Loyalität in eurem Freundeskreis
Ihr zeigt euch gegenseitig an und so'n Scheiß
Also irgendwie müsst ihr doch charakterlos sein
Banger-Bro, jeder meiner Crew ist krasser
Die Rebell-Lounge wischt sich mit der JUICE den Arsch ab
Hip-Hop-Medien supporten sanftere Kerle
Denn unsere Schwänze sind zu lang für ihre Ärsche
Ihr unterschreibt bei 'nem Major 'n Deal (Ah, SC, ah)
Und verkauft dann die Hälfte von mir

Jeder hält ein Gewehr, B-A-N-G-E-R
Hurensohn, du machst auf Moslem mit dei'm Bart
Doch wenn's um's Eingemachte geht
Bestellst du dir das Schweinenackensteak
Der King, der Champ, der Chief, sitze mit der Gang im Jeep
Fahren nach Berlin, 'ne Runde Klingelmännchen spiel'n
Merhaba, ich komm' mit annormalen Songs
Und begrüße Rapper mit einem Scha-la-la-la-la-lom
Das ist nicht der Thron, auf dem du Penner grad sitzt
Rapper brauche keinen Flow, sondern 'nen Herrenhaarschnitt
Aha, aha, jeder, der denkt, dass er im Showbiz on top sei
Kriegt von mir das Solingen rostfrei
Oglum, du willst Stress
Ich steh' vor deiner Wohnung mit der Tec
Du kleine Fotze mit Napoleon-Komplex
Bestell' Champagner, denn er ist nach acht Gläsern leer
Dankeschön an unser'n Gastgeber Fler, yeah

Jasko, es ist immer noch der Dreckskanake
Ich ficke B-Tights Mutter wie auf meiner letzten Platte
Der Betrugo hier ist immer noch G
Und deine Mom ist wie Boom Beach, ich hab die Finger im Spiel
Ich seh' nur reihenweise Lutscher, und ich rede nicht von Facebook
Wenn ich sage, wir teilen deine Mutter
Crackdealer Sound für den Häftling im Bau
Ich hol' mehr Fotzen vor die Kamera als Backspin TV
Eine Gatling im Bau, ich mach' alles, außer Spaß
G-Hot, deine Mutter, sie macht alles, außer Arsch
Die Bitch gibt sich Becks in der Wohnung wie ein Penner
Und dein Vater ist 'ne ipne, Homosexueller
Ich zog Novoline im Keller und hab Titten in der Hand
Etwas Lippenstift am Schwanz, ich muss ficken wie ein Mann
Yeah, Banger Musik, echter G-Rap auf deutsch
Fler bleibt ein Hurensohn, auch wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft

Yeah, eyo, Asphalt Massaka 3, ich hab wieder Blut geleckt
Milfhunter-Style, reife Mütter suchen guten Sex
Im Mund von dieser Gina ficken und zwar so tief, bis meine Eier
An ihrem Kinn hängen und sie aussieht wie Peter Griffin
Wieder spitten, du sitzt ahnungslos auf dem Sofa
Willst deine Bitch zurückerobern und trinkst Pisse mit Cola
(Haha) Fick auf Schule, Bruder, jetzt sind Wörter meine Waffe
Als ich wusste, wie man Geld zählt, hab ich aufgehört mit Mathe
Oberbilk, Mann, hier laufen keine Gangs auf Straßen
Um deine Bitch zu haben, muss man mit Paypal zahlen
Denn sie macht Cybersex für Kokaina
Und ist jederzeit eh on, wie Stromanbieter
Finanzamt fickt, doch ich bin am Tricksen - Uri Geller
Und mit Absätzen beschäftigt, wie ein Damenschuhhersteller
Fick die Stars von heute und dein Alter Ego
Ich fick Nazibräute auf Pegida-Demos

M-A-J, ich schieß' auf Schore-Junks
Meine Frau trägt nur noch Röcke
Damit keiner behauptet, sie hätte die Hosen an
Komm' ich mit Turban, du Homo, dann wird es eskalieren
Wie der erfinder vom Sturmstaffel-Logo
Packe die Langhantelstange, habe die Kur in mir drin
Und klatsche deine gesamte Bande im Uhrzeigersinn
Dieser MOK klaut wieder Chips liegt auf der Couch und er frisst
Weil sein Bauch fetter ist als der Mount Everest
Merk' dir, dass dich das Label mit dem Boxhandschuh killt
Er ist so fett, dass ihn nicht einmal die Bosst-TraFo hilft
Bitch, mein Herz ist aus Stahl, sag mir, wer macht auf hart?
Dann beißt er halt ins Gras, wie'n Pferd oder Schaf
Du würdest gern in meiner Haut stecken, so wie Testo-Spritzen
Ich bin auf 180, wie ein gestreckter Winkel
Zu viele Rapper, die sich bücken im Biz
Deswegen AM3, es werden wieder Mütter gefickt, Bitch",Banger Imperium,2017

Rap von echten Straßenjungs in dein Ohr
Es ist 18 Karat, also pump und support!

Wir sind Gangster, Gangster, ihr seid Pisser oder Blender
Wir sind Supremos und kommen nicht auf einen Nenner (niemals)
Keine Ahnung, ob ihr sowas versteht, bei uns zählt Ehre und Loyalität
Denn wir sind, wir sind, wir sind Gangster, Gangster, Schüsse aus dem Benzer
Gangster, Gangster, real recognize real
Wir sind Gangster, Gangster
Wir sind, wir sind, wir sind Gangster, Gangster

Glaubst du mir nicht? Dann frag mal deine Schwester, die ich fick'
Ob ich real bin? Vato, wieso testest du es nicht?
Fick dein Testo, das du spritzt, wenn mein Messer in dir sitzt
Gekommen um zu ficken, ich geh' keine Kompromisse ein
Ich bin ehrlich und direkt, lass ma' diese Sticheleien
Hol mir deine Sicherheit! Was los? Kommt doch!
Und redet nicht im Slang von Betonblocks
Non-stop Ansagen, Non-stop-Wellemacher
Doch so ein Typ wie Cro nennt mich nach 'ner Schelle Papa
Mit der Street nichts zu tun, lass mal diese Faxen sein
Ich komm' in eure Hood gefahren und sammel eure Masken ein

Endlich wieder jemand da der die Szene zerlegt
Und trotz seiner Maske von seinem Leben erzählt
Ich zersäge das Game, ich bin gegen den Fame
Nutte, gegen den Fame, ich bin gegen den Fame

Ich bin 18 Karat und mein eigener Rücken
Deutscher Rap benimmt sich leider wie so 'ne Schlampe
Ohne Maske seht ihr aus wie Kripo-Beamte
Ich trag' die Maske nur, weil ich mit Mafiosos häng'
Sei dir sicher, dass keiner von ihnen Marsimoto kennt
Ich fick' die Szene mit Realness und ein bisschen Taktgefühl
Was ist falsch mit dir? Warum ist deine Maske grün?
Ich hab' frischen Wind gebracht und die Szene abgekühlt
Von der Hölle in die Charts, ich wurde über Nacht berühmt
Die Straße zeigt kein Gesicht
Auch wenn ich jetzt mit Farid in 'nem Nightliner sitz'
Fick auf Likes oder Klicks, jeder weiß wie es ist

Wenn ihr wirklich mich meint, legt die Fakten auf den Tisch
Ich bin nicht Genetikk, Lance Butters, Cro oder sonst wer
Ready to die also kommt her
Ich bin kampfbereit, doch ich werde von euch Hurensöhnen angezeigt
Deutscher Rap hat zu kleine Eier für einen Schwanzvergleich
Verstecken sich wie Bitches hinter Zuhältern
Und spielen dann im Interview Gangster
Supremos ist ein Lebensstil, eine Macht und 'ne Bewegung

Ich bin die neue Ära immer Undercover
Und ficke Rap, denn ich war schon immer Tam der Baba

Ich bin aggressiv, weil ich seit Wochen nichts mehr schreibe
Ich gebe Gas und ich fahre durch die Gegend
Überhole auf der linken Spur einen rasenden Mercedes

Doch ich war stabil und ich bin ein Löwe geblieben
Zwischen bösen Intrigen, zwischen Schlangen und Ratten
Die dir Lügen auftischen und sie anders verpacken
Zwischen Leuten, die Pelz tragen, Koks ziehen und Geld haben
Zwischen Jungs, die seit elf Jahren in Zellen warten
Ich wurde groß mit Brüdern, die kein Baba haben
Was wissen wir schon über eure Paragraphen
Wir leben unsre eigenen Gesetze

Wie ein König, denn die Straße ist mein Königreich
Ich bin ein Löwe, weil ein Löwe in der Höhle bleibt

Ich atme aus ich atme ein
Als kleiner Supremo hast du ‘ne harte Zeit
Und mit der Zeit wirst du diszipliniert
Und auf einmal möchte jeder Zweite Business mit dir
Du musst aussortieren sie sind neben dir, wenn ‘s läuft
Doch sie warten auf ‘ne Möglichkeit und legen dich auf’s Kreuz
Sie benehmen sich wie’n Freund, benebelt von dem Zeug
Ficken ihre Freundschaft und hintergehen sich für paar Joints
Für paar Scheine und Autos
Ich nehm‘ kein Blatt vor dem Mund, Mann, das mein‘ ich genau so (genau so)
Sie lassen sich von Euros verführen
Von der Straße umarmen und vom Teufel berühren, aber

Weil sie genau wissen, ich bin da

Ich handle im Affekt, am nächsten Tag sind sie weg
Kein Spaß, ich bin kriminell und konsequent
Sie laden meine Alben hoch und sehen mich als Konkurrenz
Ich hatte die Top Ten in Sicht

Sie wollen mich im Leichen- oder Streifenwagen, doch sie können mir einen blasen!

Rapper suchen Doppelreime, die kleinen Wissenschaftler
Ihr Schauspieler, macht mir mal nicht auf Dealer!
Eure Uhren sind gefaked und eure Ketten aus China
Ich rapp' die Wahrheit, mir egal, ob ich entertaine
Zeit, um ein Zeichen zu setzen in der Blenderszene
Lang genug habt ihr Scheiße verkauft
Wenn ich will, kauf' ich die Szene und ich schmeiße euch raus
In der Rapwelt ist das Wort Hurensohn vergänglich
Bei uns gehen dafür Brüder ins Gefängnis
Ihr postet den ganzen Tag Bilder von Weedpacks
Ich mach' das hier für meine Jungs, ich will gar kein Feedback
Will keine Features und auch nicht Kollabos
Ich chill' nur mit Echten und rauch' paar Tornados?
Für die meisten Rapper hier ist rappen ein Spiel
Aber ich bin Karat, real recognize real
Yeah, und ihr seid alles Plastiksoldaten
Sag dein'n Jungs, bitte all'n, wer 'ne Schlacht will, soll sagen!
Pusherhandy Blackberry, GPRS-los
Wer von euch will Krieg mit den Ghettos?
Während ihr auf eurer Tour wart und Texte schriebt
War ich auf der Straße und habe Packs gedealt
Mit der Kripo im Nacken ein paar Kilos verpackt
Und die Bull'n hören alles übers Mikrofon ab
Fick alle eure Storys, mein Leben ist ein Buch
Ich rede nicht, ich tu's, deshalb geht es mir so gut
Ihr redet ganz groß, doch ihr klein'n Kinder bleibt schwanzlos
Jahrelanger Beef, alles Internetrambos
Eure große Fresse geht mit dem Ruhm verlor'n
Plötzlich seid ihr keine Gangstarapper, sondern gut versorgt
Trägt Krawatten und seid echo-nominiert
Aber keiner hier präsentiert das Ghetto so wie wir
Von S-Bahn zu CLS fahr'n
Eure Mütter sind euch heilig gut, dann fick' ich eure Schwestern
Respekt ging den Bach runter
Für mich ist Niko von Backspin 'ne Lachnummer, du kleine Sharmuta
Redet mein Album klein, dieser kleine Pissverein
Vielleicht rechnet ihr mit einem Diss, aber nicht mit Blei
Die Straße kennt keine Grenzen
Und jemand, der Eier hat, erhängt nicht mit schwätzen
Ihr sagt, ich hab' alles richtig gemacht
Bin kein Rapper, doch die halbe Szene trifft nicht den Takt
Ihre Texte sind nur sinnloser Müll
Ihre Alben sind mit Skits oder Intros gefüllt
Heute sprech' ich ein Machtwort
Außer Davud gab mir keiner aus der Presse eine Plattform (keiner)
Ja, von ihn'n werd' ich als Bedrohung eingestuft
Vielleicht liegt's an euch, vielleicht liegt es auch an meinem Ruhm
Ich bleibe cool, obwohl nur wenige pushen
Ich war nie so der Typ für dieses Penisgelutsche
Rapper wollten fünf Mille wegen ihren Sechzehnern
Heute schreiben sie mir „Babalied, du bist bester Mann!“
Ich bin enttäuscht von der Szene
Ein Euro pro CD, was bring'n euch eure Verträge?
Ich bin selfmade und ich meine nicht die Gruppe
Deutscher Rap ist heutzutage leider eine Nutte
Viel dreckiger als das Drogengeschäft
Sie rappen „Bling-bling“, aber fahren Opel Kadett
Machen sich vor Vierzehnjährigen zu Clowns
Und die Masche zieht, deshalb rege ich mich auf
Ich nehme es in Kauf, dass ich mir hiermit Feinde mache
Werd' mich nie verstell'n, ich scheiß' auf die breite Masse
Wir sind Nummer eins, ihr seid alle zweite Klasse
Ich weiß, wie du tickst, für dich brauche ich keine Waffe
Meine Maske ist nur zum Schutz da
Vor den Bull'n, aber nicht vor euch Lutscher
Ich bin Pusher, kauft die CD!
Diese ganze Scheiße hier brachte mich auf die Idee
Diesem Game hier zu zeigen, dass das alles nur der Anfang ist (ahuu)
Und jetzt sind Rapper angepisst
Wie hat er das auf die Beine gestellt?
Hat der Junge Köpfchen oder einfach nur Geld?
Er hat beides! Und richtig Disziplin

1964...The Tribute,"I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

1964...The Tribute,"I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won, and have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser 
And I'm not what I appear to be 

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

And I lost someone who's near to me

And I'm not what I appear to be",I'm a Loser,2004
