Emmylou Harris,"Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich 
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
 
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea     
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do (pick for me James)

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh but I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you",Return of the Grievous Angel,2012
Emmylou Harris,"That's all it took
The mention of your name
And all my love for you burst into flames
I tried so hard
To let you got but look 
How I still tremble at your name
That's all it took

That's all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took

That's all it took
To make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker, line and hook
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took",That's All It Took,2012
Emmylou Harris,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that we knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
'Cause we're together again

Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The love that we knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters

No nothing else matters

Emmylou Harris,"Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down",Bottle Let Me Down,2015
Emmylou Harris,"Yes, you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes
Yes, you know how I feel
So it goes
It just couldn't be real
And we know it's wrong
And I don't think it's gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
I've been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you don't want another fight

But you better love
Find some love
You better love me, Jesus Christ

Yes, you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you, baby, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes
I guess you know how I feel
So it goes
Yes, it couldn't be real

And you want me home all night
You just don't want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
Love me baby, Jesus Christ",Hot Burrito No. 2,2015
Emmylou Harris,"(Shel Silverstein)

She arrives in all her splendor 
Each night at nine o'clock 
Her chariot is the crosstown bus 
That stops right down the block 
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in 
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again 

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
She rules this smokey kingdom 
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne 
Now the jesters flock around her tryin' to win her favors 
To see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver Dollar home 

Now her royal dress is satin 
It's shabby and it's torn 
The royal jewels are rhinestones 
The shoes are scuffed and worn 
Of the many roads she's been down, 
And the places that she's seen 
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen 

Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
Is not as haughty as she seems 
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams 
But there's a man who found her 
And he brought her to this world 
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl 

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
I rule this smokey kingdom 
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne 
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors 
To see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver Dollar home 

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar 
I rule this smokey kingdom 
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne 
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors 
To see which one will take the 
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Emmylou Harris,"Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again
Somehow through the day I don't give in

Don't you know don't you know I need you",Sleepless Nights,2015
Emmylou Harris,"We've all got wheels to take ourselves away
We've got the telephones to say what we can't say
We all got higher and higher every day
Come on wheels take this boy away

We're not afraid to ride
We're not afraid to die
So come on wheels take me home today
Come on wheels take this boy away

And when I feel my time is almost up
And destiny is in my right hand
I'll turn to him who made my faith so strong
Come on wheels make this boy a man

So come on wheels take me home today

Emmylou Harris,"It was a teenage wedding 
And the old folks wished them well 
You could see that Pierre 
Did truly love the mademoiselle 
And now the young monsieur and madame 
Have rung the chapel bell 
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks 
It goes to slow you never can tell 

They furnished off an apartment 
With a two room Roebuck sale 
The coolerator was crammed 
With T.V. Dinners and ginger ale 
But when Pierre found work 
The little money comin' worked out well 
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell 

They had a hi-fi phono 
Boy did they let it blast 
Seven hundred little records 
All rockin' rhythm and jazz 
But when the sun went down 
The rapid tempo of the music fell 
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks 
It goes to show you never can tell 

They bought a souped-up Jimmy 
T'was a cherry-red fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans 
To celebrate their anniversary 
It was there that Pierre 
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle

Emmylou Harris,"This old town is filled with sin 
It will swallow you in 
If you've got some money to burn 
Take it home right away 
You've got three years to pay 
But Satan is waiting his turn 
The scientists say 
It will all wash away 
But we don't believe any more 
Cause we've got our recruits 
And our green mohair suits 
So please show your I.D. At the door 
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house 
It seems like this whole town's insane 
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door 
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain 

A friend came around 
Tried to clean up this town 
His ideas made some people mad 
But he trusted his crowd 
So he spoke right out loud 
And they lost the best friend they had 
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house 
It seems like this whole town's insane

Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me, it's plain
I should have known you'll never wear my ring
I know I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Why can't I forget you
Start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you",Sweet Dreams,2015

Je voudrais un bonhomme de neige
Oh, viens jouer avec moi!
Tu te caches, on ne se voit plus
Dis que fais-tu?
Tu n'es plus vraiment toi

Nous étions sœurs et amies
Mais c'est fini
J'aimerais savoir pourquoi!

Je voudrais un bonhomme de neige
Oui, s'il te plaît un bonhomme de neige

(Va-t'en, Anna)
Pense à moi

Je voudrais un bonhomme de neige
Ou faire du vélo dans la cour
Je suis une fille en manque de compagnie
Je parle aux murs et à ces portraits qui m'entourent!

Salut Jeanne d'Arc!

Je suis seule et je m'ennuie
Tu restes de glace
Et moi j'attends que les heures passent

Elsa, peux-tu ouvrir cette porte?
Pourquoi restes-tu enfermée?
On me dit ""sois forte, le temps arrange tout""
Mais j'ai besoin de nous pour oublier

Que nous n'avons plus personne
Plus aucune famille
Quel avenir pour nous?

Emmylou Homs,"J'ai envie de vous dire une chose totalement insensée

Allez-y, je vous en prie!

Toute ma vie je n'ai trouvé que des portes fermées
Jusqu'au jour où je suis tombé sur vous

C'est aussi le sentiment que j'ai, parce que

J'ai passé mon temps à chercher ma bonne étoile
Jusqu'à cette grande fête royale où mon cœur se régale

Avec vous

Avec vous
Je n'hésite plus

Je vous ai vu

Et j'ai découvert un sentiment nouveau
L'amour est un cadeau!
L'amour est un cadeau!
L'amour est un cadeau!

Pour nous!

Pour nous!

Pour nous!

Pour nous!

L'amour est un cadeau

Comment expliquer

Quoi

Qu'un inconnu finisse

Toutes vos phrases!

C'est ce que j'allais vous dire!

Je ne connais personne

Qui me ressemble autant!

Chips!
Chips personnel!

Nos âmes sont comme synchronisées
Une seule façon de l'expliquer

Notre
Amour
Est
Si
Évident!
Dites adieu

Dites adieu

Aux douleurs du passé
Ce qui nous attend est bien plus beau!

L'amour est un cadeau!
L'amour est un cadeau!
Le monde sera plus beau!

Pour nous!

Pour nous!

Pour nous!

Pour nous!

Emmylou Homs,"Ouvrez les volets
Dans le salon
Laissez entrer cet air, il sent si bon
Et mettez les petits plats dans les grands

J'étais seule dans ces longs couloirs
Il n'y avait pas de bal le soir
Enfin nous entrons dans l'air du temps

Les invités seront bien vivants
Et tant pis si cela dérange
Mais, moi, j'avais tellement hâte que ça change!

Et je vais fêter ce renouveau
Dans ma robe de satin
Je vais fêter ce renouveau
En dansant jusqu'au matin
Enflammée, exaltée, surexcitée
Ils peuvent bien dire ce qu'ils veulent
Je vais fêter ce renouveau
Je ne serai plus seule

J'ai hâte d'accueillir tous les invités!
Et si je rencontrais l'homme de ma vie?

Ce soir je serai la plus belle
Dans une tenue des plus formelles
Une jeune fille raffinée et pleine de grâce

Il va apparaître tout à coup
Ce bel inconnu qui saura tout
Le chocolat m'aidera à faire face!

Puis nous parlerons toute la soirée
Et je me sentirai bizarre
Car changer de vie c'est tout un art!

Je vais fêter ce renouveau
Dans la magie d'une histoire!
Je vais fêter ce renouveau
Qui me donne tellement d'espoir
Je sais que ce n'est pas raisonnable
De rêver de romance
Mais je vais fêter ce renouveau
Je tenterai ma chance!

Cache tes pouvoirs
N'en parle pas
Fais attention
Le secret survivra
Sereine
Sans peine
Tu régneras
Un seul faux pas
Et tout le monde saura

Mais ce n'est qu'une seule journée
Ce n'est qu'une seule journée!
La pression est si forte
La pression est si forte!

Dites aux gardes qu'il faut ouvrir les portes!
Les portes!

Je vais fêter ce renouveau

Cache tes pouvoirs n'en parle pas

Qui m'apporte ce dont j'ai rêvé

Fais attention le secret survivra

Je veux quitter ma tour d'ivoire

Sois sage

Trouver l'amour ce soir!

Pas d'états d'âmes
De sentiments

Je sens que c'est le bon moment
C'est maintenant ou jamais
Et je vais fêter ce renouveau
Je vais fêter ce renouveau
Faire ce qui me plaît!",Le  renouveau,2013

'Bout our past (past, past)

Früher hatte ich nichts, ja, wir hatten nicht viel
Mama hat gesagt, du erreichst dein Ziel
Wenn du nicht aufgibst, also trau dich
Aber wenigstens hast du es probiert
Mein Sohn, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, aber wenigstens hast du es probiert

Jeden Tag draußen mit den Jungs chill'n, abhäng'n und schwänzen
Nachts auf das Dach, uns're Stadt war am Glänzen
Grenzen gab's nicht, als Kids schon Rebell'n
Uns're Denkweise war zu oft: Fick diese Welt
AP, von Hip-Hop-Jam zu Hip-Hop-Jam
Ich saß im Zug und lernte Hip Hop kenn'
Kein Geld, broke, früh aus dem Elternhaus raus
Mein Plan war, Ich komm zurück und bau ein Traumhaus
Falsch gedacht, falsch gedacht
Bekam 'ne Wohnung ohne Strom, es war kalt und nass
Vergesse nie den Kühlschrank, der jeden Tag leer war
Köln-Kalk, Hungersnot, jede Nacht schmerzhaft
Kaltes Wasser, Teekerzen leuchten
Lieber Gott, was soll das alles hier bedeuten?
Ein Leben zwischen kriminellen Freunden
Das war nicht die Vision aus meinen Träumen
Und in Berlin war's vielleicht ein Stück besser
Doch ganz bestimmt kein Glückstreffer
Ja, Gott hat mich hier hingeführt und wieder weggebracht
Durch das finst're Tal, doch ich hab's echt geschafft

Alles edel, ihre Nägel

Diesen ganzen Mädels
Doch für sie würd ich mich ändern
Und nie wieder Bitches kenn' lern'
Nie mehr Party, sinnlos ausgeh'n
Sondern sie zu meiner Frau nehm'n
Und ich hoff nur, dass sie mir das alles abkauft
Dann führ ich sie heut Nacht aus

Strahlend weißes Lächeln

Heut' ist es mir egal was auch immer du machst
Klar tut's weh mit anzusehen wie du dein Ding machst
Letztes Jahr noch überlegt welcher Ring passt
Letztes Jahr noch im Urlaub
Und ich vermiss' es  was interessieren mich die Bitches
All dieser Luxus scheiß auf Champagner,
Scheiß' auf die Partys, dass Geld ich war dankbar,
Dass ich dich traf das war Schicksal auf der Miss Wahl
Als ich dich sah und ich dachte echt das mit uns passt
Wir sind Erwachsen also 'nen mir den Grund Schatz,
Deine Augen haben gelogen du bist schön doch vergleichbar mit Rosen
Niemals anfassen es könnte weh tun
Ich hab ein Herz aus Stein doch ich geb's zu.

Schatz ich wünscht' du könntest dich durch meine Augen sehn'
Wie du's geniest zu wissen dass die Jungs so auf dich stehn'
Du wolltest frei sein und so wurd' ich eingetauscht
Du bist Schuld daran dass ich nich' mehr vertrau'

Ich hass' es dich zu lieben
Außer diesem Schmerz ist mir nichts geblieben
Wir waren zu verschieden Streitereien und irgendwie
Genieß' diese Einsamkeit, ich höre oft
Man hat dich hier und dort gesehen mit ihm gesehen
Du konntest nicht Wiederstehen
Auf dem Tisch rumgeknutscht warst nicht zu retten
Dom Pérignon Schlacht mit Servietten
Drei vier Typen Kontakt ausgetauscht eine Frage
Sag wie krass bist du drauf?
Ich erkenn' dich nicht mehr das bist du nicht
Erzähl mir nicht dass du glücklich bist erzähl mir nicht
Dass es sich gelohnt hat, lüg' nich'
Wer macht dir jetzt Frühstück
Wer ist jetzt da wenn du krank bist
Wenn's dir schlecht geht
Du bist weg und es tut echt weh, ich hasse dich.

Emory,"Hey ich bin's
Ich weiß nicht ob deine Nummer noch aktuell is' umm
Ich wollt mich bei dir melden und dir sagen
Dass es mir gut geht und
Ich hier halt glücklich bin und umm
Drum schick ich auch meine Nummer nicht auch nicht mit
Ich glaub es is'besser so
Aber tu mir bitte ein Gefallen und pass auf dich auf
Bis dann tchau

Ich denk an uns und schreib diesen Text jetzt
Ich vermiss dich immernoch und es stresst echt
Mein Pech wächst seit dem Tag
Als du mich verlassen hast, komm allein nicht klar, immer
Partys hier, Partys da, du bist gegangen
My first love, ja, ich hatt' kein Geld
Ich hatt' kein Fame, damals hieß ich noch Kenneth
Es gab kein Kay doch du hast mich geliebt
Geliebt wie ich bin, vielleicht war ich ein Arsch
Doch Liebe macht blind, aber du warst da, mein Superstar
Ich hatt' kein Problem mit dem Zug zu fahren
Egal wo du warst, ich bin gekomm'n
In der Zeit kannt' ich kein Dom Perignon
Ich war broke und ich konnt dich nirgends einladen
Aber trotzdem sprachen wir vom Heiraten
Lass mich dir eins sagen
Ich vermiss diese Zeit
Wär so gern wieder glücklich vereint, aber nein

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt
(My first love) Schatz, ich sag Dankeschön
Für die Zeit, es tut mir Leid
(My first love) Wo du auch bist und was du grad tust
Ich hoff' dir geht's gut
(My first love)

Bis jetzt hat's noch keine geschafft
Mein Herz zu bekommen, ich vergleich dich, mein Schatz
Mit jeder Frau die ich kennenlern' und es nervt echt
Keine hier ist perfekt
Manche sind sehr nett, hey und manche nur hübsch
In manchen steckt auch 'ne Bitch
Es ist wie es ist, es kommt wie es kommt, Schicksal
Als die Quittung kam war klar, ich zahl
Ich sah bei uns Zukunft, doch vielleicht waren wir zu jung
„geh mit ihr gut um!“, drohte dein Daddy
Ich hatt' kein Geld doch kaufte dein Blackberry
Denn mir war's egal, ich hab dich geliebt
Und ohne dich leben, macht depressiv
In der Nacht so aktiv, du raubst mein Schlaf, kein Scheiß
Und da hilft kein Geld, da hilft kein Hype
Denn wahre Liebe kannst du nicht kaufen
Die eine unter 100.000

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt
(My first love) Schatz, ich sag Dankeschön
Für die Zeit, es tut mir Leid

Emory,"Es war 'ne Wahnsinnsnacht, ich erinner mich
Hab dir gezeigt, was ein Candlelight-Dinner ist
Wir tranken Weißwein und schon allein dein
Sommerkleid bleibt mein Highlight, ich lieb dein Style
Dein Outfit war heiß, ich mag dein
Auftreten, du könntest echt ein Star sein
So viel gelacht und diskutiert
Danach hab ich gesagt, woll'n wir nicht zu mir?
Ich könnt dich massier'n, dich studier'n
Ich hab noch ein Geschenk und es ist kariert
Doch es liegt bei mir, jetzt liegt's an dir
Ob wir bald losgeh'n, es wird nichts passier'n
Außer Kuscheln, und du grinst selbst
Wir müssen los, Baby, es wird um 5 hell
Und was in Stuttgart passiert, bleibt auch in Stuttgart
Psch, ich seh doch, dass du Lust hast

Es ist okay
Du musst dich nicht schäm'n
Ich weiß, du bist normalerweise nicht so, versteh ich
Es war doch nur ein One Night Stand
Es war doch nur ein One Night Stand
Auch wenn wir uns nicht richtig kenn'
Nehm ich, dich ins Bett
Ich wusst von Anfang an
Das war ein One Night Stand

Ich wurd' schnell wach und du lagst da
Immer noch halbnackt, Schatz, es war klar
Wir hatten so guten Sex, ich lieb es so
Wenn sich 'ne Frau fallen lässt, zügellos
Meine Kratzer am Rücken, am Hals die Bissspur'n
Und dein Haar duftete nach Gliss-Kur
Leidenschaftlich gezeigt, was 'ne heiße Nacht ist
Und nein, es war nicht meine Absicht
Ich wollt dir nicht wehtun, du hast noch geschlafen
Ich bin gegang'n, ohne etwas zu sagen
Keine Nummer, kein Zettel, hart, ich weiß
Das war nicht nice
Das war nicht cool und ich bin auch nicht stolz drauf
Ich schieb's bestimmt nicht auf den Vollrausch
Aber das mit uns zweien würde niemals gut geh'n
Verdammt, ich geb's zu, ich wollte dir nicht weh tun

Emory,"Ich hab gedacht, dass es leicht wär
Es wird mir klar, ich muss eins lern'
Schmerz geht, doch die Narben sind für immer
Die Hoffnung scheint unauffindbar
War ich zu jung oder nur zu dumm?
Das mit dir hatte Zukunft
Schatz, ich wollte was festes
Es war'n deine Worte, entweder so oder man lässt es
Ich gab dir mein Wort, hab noch geschwor'n
War noch im Studio, machte 'nen Song
Jeden Tag draußen, Kino, spazier'n
All diese Bilder, sie sind noch hier
Verdammt, ich vermiss dich
Komm zurück, ich werd' anders nicht glücklich
Und ja, ich versteh, was du meinst
All meine Fehler, ich seh sie jetzt ein, dass ich
Nicht da war, das tut mir so Leid
Du hast noch versucht, nicht zu wein'
Auch wenn du jetzt glücklich bist
Bitte vergiss mich nicht, Gott beschütze dich

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn ich aufsteh und am Frühstücken bin
Schatz, glaub mir, ich fühl mich so schlimm
Kein Chill'n, kein Kuscheln, kein Sex
Ich sitz nur zuhause und schreib Tracks
Doch jeder Track ist über dich
Ich will, dass es wieder wie früher ist
Weißt du noch, unser erster Kuss
Unser erstes Date, brachte dich zum Bus
Alles war zu schön, doch was ist jetzt?
Das passiert, wenn man jemanden nicht schätzt
Ja, du bist weg, aber wohin?
Sag, warum war ich so blind?
Nein, Geld macht nicht glücklich
Was bringt ein 5-Sterne-Koch, wenn du nichts isst?
Was bringt dir Urlaub allein, Champagner und Wein?
Nein, es bringt dir nichts, wenn du kein' hast zum Teil'n
Jetzt bist du frei, also genieß diese Zeit
Baby, nie wieder Streit und ich will, dass du weißt
Dass ich immer da bin
Bitte pass auf sie auf, amen

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert

Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn wir zwei allein
Jetzt uns're Wege geh'n
Ich hoff, du weißt
Egal, was auch passiert
Ich bin für dich da
Ich hoff, es gibt ein Wiederseh'n

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n

Emory,"Uh, ich seh' dich leiden und du weinst viel
Was ich mein, die Streitereien zum Beispiel
Wie er dich ausnutzt, deine Gutmütigkeit
Und ehrlich, mir tut's für dich Leid
Was du alles für Ihn tust
Die Wünsche von den Lippen liest
Ein Tipp von mir, geh und vergiss den Typ
Er hat dich nicht verdient, du hast es mitgespielt
Ich guck in dein Augen, dein Blick genügt
Ich würd' dir gern diese Entscheidung nehmen
Versuch dir beizustehen
Verdammt ich kann dich nicht mehr weinen sehen
Der Glanz in deinen Augen ist längst nicht mehr da
Ich hoff' dass du dich trennst von dem Arsch
Denk doch mal nach, es wird nicht wie früher
Einmal ein Lügner, für immer ein Lügner, Betrüger
Er wird es nie verstehen
Bei dir fließen Tränen
Es ist zu viel geschehen

Das Spiel, dass er mit dir spielt
Ist falsch weil er nichts mehr fühlt
Ja, du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind
Sag, wie oft willst du ihm noch verzeihen?
Verschwende nicht deine kostbare Zeit
Du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind (bist du blind)

Du bist blind, bist geblendet, bist verliebt
Dieser Typ hat die Geschenke nicht verdient
Du glaubst mir nicht, kein Ding, frag nach eurem Jahrestag
Und weißt du was die Antwort sein wird „Warte mal“
Du hast ihn deinen Eltern vorgestellt
Jetzt bereust du es, hast du's dir so vorgestellt?
Du warst für ihn da, als es ihm so scheiße ging
Eine Woche später, 'ne andere begleitet ihn
Du hast ihm gleich verziehn', obwohl's geschmerzt hat
Obwohl du wusstest, dass dieser Mann kein Herz hat
Ich hoff' du lernst was daraus
Denn die meisten Typen erkennen
Einfach nicht den Wert einer Frau
Es ist schwer zu vertrauen
Doch du hast es nicht kommen sehen
Merk dir eins, schlechte Menschen kommen und gehen
Er wird es nie verstehen
Bei dir fließen Tränen
Es ist zu viel geschehen

Das Spiel, dass er mit dir spielt
Ist falsch weil er nichts mehr fühlt
Ja, du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind
Sag, wie oft willst du ihm noch verzeihen?
Verschwende nicht deine kostbare Zeit
Du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind

Und ich frage mich bloß
Warum du noch bleibst
Du glaubst seiner Show, ich seh' doch wie du weinst
Doch es gibt kein Happy-End
Und glaub mir du verdienst einen besseren

Und ich frage mich bloß

On in the weary body to stray 
But we shall walk beside the still waters 
With the Good Shepherd leading The Way 

Those who have strayed were sought by The Master 
He who once gave His life for the sheep 
Out on the mountain still He is searching 
Bringing them in forever to keep 

Going up home to live in green pastures 
Where we shall live and die never more 
Even The Lord will be in that number 
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore 

We will not heed the voice of the stranger 
For he would lead us to despair 
Following on with Jesus our savior 
We shall all reach that country so fair

He proclaimed his destruction of a mortal coil
In the end it seemed
This was his only possession

Of filth and lies
And he has reached out to stop time

It swallowed him in a dark and heavy cloud

[5:12]

Every time this year
This dark fog will appear
Up from the tombs it comes
To take one more life that can be near
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long time ago gone,
It is thin and so beautiful
But also so dark and mysterious

Once again the priest is messing
May the God bless us all
The fog is here again
That will complete this funeral
From a place empty of life
Only dead trees are growing here
As it comes from a far
Only dead trees are growing here

Funeral fog. [4x]

So sweet, cool and so fair

Cause trust is just something you just don't get involved

Forget your allegations and your investigations

I did it for you
I wish to be your love and save you
I tried to turn back the time
I’ve got to reach against the ages
And now I realise
You were the one I always run to
O, darling

I wanna go
I just wanna ride with you
‘Cause then I know I'll be by your side
With you tonight

I wanna go
I just wanna ride with you
‘Cause then I know I'll be by your side
With you tonight

I I’d rather think it's time we go
Oh, I’ll let it go

I don't know myself
When you are not around
I won't realize
All I got until it’s gone
Just let the fire, fire burn
O, darling

I wanna go
I just wanna ride with you
‘Cause then I know I'll be by your side
With you tonight

We slept to the radio
Gentle as my heart beats now
Turn up the fuse all over again, my friend

Just to take me away

Rewind, be my DNA

Rewind, there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime, it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts, now they beat the same

There is a thread that runs along
The seam of all the paths we've crossed
A colour wheel that spins around
Weave all into one
The price of getting setting suns
We're running to the beat of the drum
We are the creatures, rays and larks
Relax

On our own island
Just out of choice

Guiding us on (can't you hear us calling you)

Emry Arthur,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2001
Emry Arthur,"There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of a many poor boy
And me, oh God, for one

Then fill the glasses to the brim
Let the drinks go merrily around
And we'll drink to the health of a rounder poor boy
Who goes from town to town

The only thing that a rounder needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Now boys, don't believe what a girl tells you
Though her eyes be blue or brown
Unless she's on some scaffold high
Saying, ""Boys, I can't come down""

Go tell my youngest brother
Not to do the things I've done
But to shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

I'm going back, back to New Orleans
For my race is nearly run
Gonna spend the rest of my wicked life
Beneath that Rising Sun

giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times,

But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.

And something warm to come to

That somehow we are the same

Careless whispers of a nation
That somehow was caught trapped in the dark

The sooner I take more responsibilities
I can truly say
I am grateful for my world

Is whatever you do, some will undo
And sometimes destroy
And there's someone still left in darkness

What we see today
Are the results of the mistakes they made yesterday
And what we see tomorrow
Will be the results of what we do today

Has been replaced with money and power
The children, they are the futures
So teach them how to love themselves
And they will love others

Verse 1
Many say
That I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from.
But you will see
It's just a matter of time
My love surely make you mine

(1)
Well, I'm
Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight
Nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on
With my man
People out there can understand

(2)
I'm givin him somethin he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

So much joy for us it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
(hey, oh yeah)
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true.
You tell me 'what does it mean'.",Giving Him Something He Can Feel,1992

We were being asked to the dance floor 
Before I got his name 
He was hittin' on me strong 
But I knew from the conversation 
He was a little bit too young 
 
[Chorus]

Brown leather combat sales tag on his hat 
He wore his clothes inside-out (yo mental tip, oh) 
He had a funky step and I thought he was so cute 
But as far as hooking up with him 
He had to come harder than that, yeah

When the set was over 
We headed out to the car 
He politely asked to walk me out 
He's playng good so far 
The minute I blinked my eyes 
He snuck in a little kiss

It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings

Here's a flow
An En Vogue hip-hop intro
Time to rap talk about the info
Pertaining to the four
Who re-opened the harmony door
(And let the vocals soar)

(Shoo wop shoo wop)

All of the gossipin' it put us in a recite mode
Unloadin' while the grooves explodin'
Just steppin' and keepin' pepin'

About our history and our passin'
How long (steady, strong)
Will the En Vogue be lastin'?
Askin' or predictin'
The quad squad will roll
(And continue to kick it wicked)
Wicked doubts about the en-v

Trying to down Dawn, Maxine, Terry or Cindy
Black, beautiful, intelligent
Well structured and strong
It's gonna be along for ever hold on

repeat chorus

(It ain't over)

So, continuing my flow
Goin' back about two years ago
Lip-synching was the way to go, though
a face to a voice, a voice to a face
All the real talent was just going to waste

The word was out
A talent-search was on
Auditioned with ambition
A vision
En Vogue was born
To sing, the essential ingredients mended
Four individuals perfectly blended
Strong mind, positive, attitude is a must
Group trust
Eliminated the outside rush
Using lies as alibis to get to us it's strange
Negative attenion you gain in the world while you entertain
Stuck up - of course not
Just the knives in our back
Those coming from behind on a publicity attack
Not easy duplicating the four
There's a lot more in store
Until the fat lady roars

repeat chorus

People wonder if we're rich
I'll tell you this
More money now than before the music hit
And our hair, of course it's real
We just jazz it up a bit for the sex appeal
And no we don't lip-synch
It's all from the heart
2 Tuff-Enuff Productions put us on the charts
A few answers I thought I should give
For the minds who enquire how the En Vogue lives
Born to sing, and we proved it
A gift from the man above
Peace to our fans, and to competitors
One love
Sorry, not in it for the competition status-quo
Our only perspective is to grow
And to blow, ya know

You used to have time for me

Could not communicate

Instead I was blind
Ignoring what people would say

Everytime someone asks
What I'm shooting for in life
I would hide my true feelings
And when I spoke up to my friends
They made fun of my dreams
So then times got too rough
I would think back on one thing
My momma would say to me

Forces of evil struck back and forth
Throughout my younger days
Because I would listen
And care what other people would say

And built my own tiny world with respect

To fall in love with each other

I want to take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found someone that can make me laugh

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Say it again y'all
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a nucca out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that

I got a good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man,
What a mighty good man

So why do people insist on lies

Coming back home with a dumb expression
Written on a face that he's guilty as a criminal
It's time to change your attitude
People do you hear me, don't listen
To a funky rhyme that's kickin' knowledge that we need
We lie about our hair
And we know we got a weave
Politicians lie about the things they're gonna do
And everybody's tale affects me and you
A smoker lies about the money that he stole
And a dope dealer never tells you how he got his gold

 Those endeavors, that you're hiding

 So high I can't get over it
 So wide I can't get around it

 When you got home, hello is all I got from you
 Don't cha think that's kinda strange

En Vogue,"Verse 1:
Nobody touches my heart like you do (ohh, ohh)
I swear I'm just hopelessly fatal for you
Cause I can't go through a day without
Thinkin' bout kissin' you places all over
All over your body and your body all over me
(don't you know)

[Chorus]
You, you are the man I want
There is no other love
You give me what I need
You are the only man for me

You can see it in my eyes how much I'm feelin' you
There's nobody else in this world I would do,
I would do
Cause you will, you will go places
That I'm not usually tasted
And it just makes me go crazy
And I can't deny I'm obsessed over you

[Chorus]

'Cause you
Long time ago stole my heart
You broke me down from the start
And nothin' has changed since the first day
That we made sweet love

Falling in love
It grabs me; it scares me
It knows how to inform me
Falling in love
It takes me on a journey
Of emotions deep inside me
Falling in love
Nothing prepared me
For this feeling that I'm feeling
Falling in love
It's draining; it's wearing
I surrender completely

Ooh I wasn't ready for this
It's good it's bad
I'm happy and I'm sad
A mystery to behold
It speaks only to heart and soul
Like a melody deep inside of me
I saw that love keeps playing on and on
A symphony so glad I hear
Angels whispering

[Chorus]

I never knew that life could be
So heavenly I'm feeling free
Oh how could something be so satisfying?
And yet a feeling of fearfulness
Is lurking in the mist of the bliss
Inside my heart, but I know that's all a part

I'm a business queen
In a courtroom kingdom
But when it comes to love
There's no software made for that

En Vogue,"Me and my friends, we went out last night
To a small simple club on the nights
It didn`t have much room, but hell they never do
Just chairs, a few tables, and some food

A small cramped band started playing, and all the room was swaying
Soon I found myself dancing, with a tall dark man
I was in a trance, a sort of romance
Between the rhythm and my soul, ohh

[Chorus]
Oooh, I wake up in the morning
And it`s all me, I can hear the calling
And it`s haunting each and everything
I didn`t know my Latin love was oh so strong
Even in the middle of romancing, really love the rhythm when I`m dancing
Can`t deny the spirit when you feel the Latin soul

After that night, my life had changed
I had no control and now I would behave
Every chance I got, I was at the club
Wining and dining like there was no tomorrow

Ooooh, oooh, So free
Ooooh, oooh, So me, yea yea
Ooooh, oooh, So lifting
And I don`t want it to stop, no

[Chorus: x]

If your life can`t seem to get going, hopelessness is showing
To your soul, and to Latin
Get into the sounds, of the rhythms beating out
'Cause when your dancing, your spirit will be free, yea

Ooh, ooh, So me, yea yea
Ooh, ooh, So uplifting, yea

Won't change my ways

And they're not into me
That's my history
I can't change it now
Cause those dogs are still on the prowl

[Chorus]
Dogs are puppies that grow up wild
And they don't do what you want them to
Treat you nice just to get a prize
And once they get it 
Then they're through with you

Get your digits to call you back
You'll never hear from him again, that's whack
He tells you you're the only one that's phat
Then hits your friend up behind your back

[Chorus]

He asked you out to see a show
And lost his wallet, how? He doesn't know
He asked you if you'd pay the bill
He'll pay you back, oh yeah, I bet he will

I bet he will
I bet he won't
He'll probably use it for a bag of smoke
A bag of smoke
You know the kind
That makes you tipsy like a bottle of wine

They like to bite
They like to fight
They like to howl at every girl in sight
They like to beg
They like to whine
They like to smell at every stray behind

A stray behind
You know the kind
They're big and round and they're easy to find
Easy to find
They are for dogs
As for a dog's life, it's a world of fun

I ain't no dog, you know I ain't no dog
How you goin' come at me like that
You know me better than that
Don't try to come and say men are dogs
Without saying that you all dogs too
The reflection of a man is the woman, it's true
And I'm here to let you know about a boo
Who tried to give her everything
Which really doesn't seem quite enough
That's why some of us give up so easy
Relationships gettin' too tough
All of a sudden there goes your friend
Flossin' around like she's sexy
What you don't know is that she'll let me
If she get a chance to get in my pants
Once or twice for her it's nice
She be schemin' from the start
Waiting for us to fall apart
I leave a little stuff inside my car

[Chorus]

Now a dog's a dog, that's just gon' be
In a group, in a single, or in different breeds
Past my fast life, perpetrating the front
Schemin' on opposite sex for what you want
Whoo, whoo, when you hear 'em callin'
Back up wit' the dog who ballin'
Take advice from the wise
When you see him comin'
It's when you slip up, we'll all be hummin'
Cause the grave's cold and the ground's wet
Tryin' to trick love on the cost of bets
See they're skank in every state
And only you can seal your fate
You twist and turn in the burnin' wreck
I leave a memory that he'll never forget

To give an example to all why y'all",Those Dogs,2000

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame

And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine

I'd never ask for anything again

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

And tenement halls""

Enchanette,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Enchant,"When I spoke with you today
I didn't know what to say
It's been so long, so long
I said I'm doing fine
But what haunts my troubled mind
Is where it all went wrong, so wrong
I did not suspect
That we would not connect
And end up strangers
I could dance with you all night
Make love by candlelight
We could talk and talk but it's all in spite
Because you'll never be my friend
I could walk with you through the rain
We could share each other's pain
We could do all this but it's all in vain
Because you'll never be my friend
As time goes flying by
I have to wonder why
I don't see you anymore
they call it chemistry
What will or will not be
What's missing between you and me
When I spoke with you today
I didn't know what to say
Maybe so long, so long
If you chance on me some night
Underneath some lone streetlight
Just wave and say,""So long ,so long""
I do not regret
The chance I shan't forget
And we're no longer strangers
You could dance with me all night
Make love by candlelight
We could talk and talk but it's all in spite
Because I'll never be your friend
You could walk with me through the rain
We could share each other's pain
We could do all this but it's all in vain
Because I'll never be your friend
Never be my friend,my friend
You wouldn't be my friend
And I couldn't be your friend
So long,so long...",Acquaintance,1995
Enchant,"I run my desperate trembling hands
Along the floor were you once walked
Fighting tears that come from loss
I brave the rooms where we once talked
You took a part of me I never can reclaim
Your spirit's in my heart
But you know it's not the same
Straining to beat this blur of tears
Swollen eyes beg for my dead friend
Reminiscing with a photograph
Drives home (that) what was won't be again
I will to guarantee my reason will prevail
Pain breeds the need for make believe
To soothe a heart that's fail
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
I drop down to my knees and plead with the sky
Of course it does no good
But I'll give anything a try
Gazing,thinking,standing on a cliff
That guards the blue-green of the sea
I accept the blueprint of the world,that
All must pass away that's come to be
You meant so much to me
That's why there's all this pain
So much improved from our exchange
It will never be same
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
We all suffer loss
As surely day changes into night",At Death's Door,1995

",Mae Dae,1995
Enchant,"My destination is unknown
And I've lost my way
But I still have water
With my rations running low
I am so fatigued
Can I go much further?
Lost and all alone
In the blazing heat
And it just gets hotter
Sweat drips down my skin
And string my eyes
As I look toward the distance
Blistered hands block the sun
That blinds my sight
And dances on the horizon
Is there something up ahead?
Or just a mirage
Fooling me again
Another dried up waterhole
Lacking nourishment
Quench my thirst and feed my mind
The place that I seek is so far away
And I don't know which way to go
The vision I see is a holy place
That is tranquil to the soul
Just a nomad sailing across this earthly sea
Searching on and on for sanctuary
Weary from the chase of life's eluding dream
Strive to reach that goal but it's never ending
Raise my canteen to parched lips
Taste the water so sweet
Take one last swallow
So many miles I have come
So many more to go
Down the path I follow
Funny how we lose our way
Through this desolate land
Lives are grains of sand
Which way will the wind blow?
Sifting through our hands
To fall wherever they may
The place that I seek is so far away
And I don't know which way to go
The vision I see is a holy place
That is tranquil to the soul",Oasis,1995
Enchant,"Take a look outside your window
And tell me what you see
Does everything look fine to you?
It seems the air is a little hazy
And the grass is much too green
What's this world coming to?
I see you haven't noticed
What's happening around you
Tell me who is fooling who?
If you choose not to take notice
And you look the other way
The path's not yours to choose
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
How is the view looking through closed eyes
It must seem very dim
Living life in such fear
Like a blind man in the darkness
Clutches to familiar things
Until he's sure the path is clear
See the walls you've built around you
It's a fortress that you've made
Such a lonely solitude
But your fortress is a prision
And you locked yourself away
Sheltered from the truth
Open eyes
If you opened up your eyes
Open eyes
You would see through the disguise
Open eyes
Accept the truth refute the lies
Open eyes
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
So think about who's thinking for you
Do you have a life to waste
Seeing what they want you to see?
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
Having the choice means everything
See the walls you've built around you
Too much trouble to escape
Well I guess that you're doomed
To live a life of indecision
You're buried alive,too late
Shall I seal up your tomb?
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes",Open Eyes,1995
Enchant,"There's a man who is lonely
This could change if he'd only
Take a chance and risk stepping outside himself
There's a girl he's been seeing
From afar he's been dreaming
he could have her if he were someone else
So he silently awaits
A major change in fate
A change that comes too late
And you're reaching for a star
But can you reach that far
Standing where you are?
The wanting was too much
You're longing for her touch
It's not within your clutch
There's a man who's been thinking
To himself he's been dreaming
How to build a skyscraper to the stars
Now he starts to go to it
He's so sure he can do it
Though he's lacking the knowledge of design
Now his dream comes crashing around him
And tumbles to the sea
Along with all he wanted to be
A realization strikes him
A harsh reality
He doesn't know everything
When the student tries to teach
The knowledge that you seek
Lies just outside your reach
There's a thirst you have to learn
A hunger inside burns
Time for the page to turn
It's the wanting,It's the hoping,It's the longing
There's a flame within your soul
To strive to reach your goal
But dreaming takes its toll
It's nature's own device
To grab and roll the dice
But each toss has its price
Emotions starts to flow
Your heart takes control
And steers you down the road
Your destination is no concern
The impulsive never learn
Just another bridge to burn
It's the wanting,It's the hoping,It's the longing...",The Thirst,1995
Enchant,"Not what I've done, not what I've spoken
Not what I've shown, not that I lied
Just holding on would render me broken
But weak as I am, my hands remain tied

Fear of wrath, fear of pain
Fear of facing what I am
Fear this might, leave a stain
Of your blood on my hands

My face is scarred, my hands unclean
Can't wash away the fool I've been
Murder one or suicide
Which would be the greater sin?

Straining to hold each breath I'm taking
A shackle that pulls, I can't set it free
Not quite below, but slowly I'm breaking
In saving you I, I would be killing me

Fear of wind, fear of rain
We built this house on shifting sand
Fear this might, leave a stain
Of my own blood on my hands

My face is scarred, my hands unclean
Can't wash away the fool I've been
Murder one or suicide
Which would be the greater sin?

A wave that hits from behind me
A weight that pulls from beneath
A storm that blows all around me
A fear inside that has bound me

Fear of wrath, fear of pain
Fear of facing what I am
Fear this might, leave a stain
Of your blood on my hands

My face is scarred, my hands unclean
Can't wash away the fool I've been
Murder one or suicide
Which would be the greater sin?
",Broken,1997
Enchant,"Standing alone in a crowded room
He hears it
A voice so familiar, not unlike his own
He fears it
His name being called out from across the room
But he can't see

He's willingly blindfolded starting towards the voice
But each step leads
Into a dance with a different stranger
His purpose he quickly forgets
Each dance delights till the song is through
But the silence between the songs
Reminds him what he'd intended to do

But the voice it knows no time, waits patiently
Can't record a wrong, his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever, it'll still be there
Waiting jealously

He moves towards the voice
More determined now but still can't see
The music begins and he's pulled away again by flattery
Just as with a drug the words purposely inoculate
All puffed up but silence
When the music ends, quickly deflates

Now the voice, though never changing
Begins to sound to him like a shriek
He covers his ears with his hands
Now deaf and blind, he wanders aimlessly
Submerged in the darkness
He's forgotten what he was to be

But the voice it knows no time, waits jealously
Can't record a wrong, his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever, it'll still be there
Waiting patiently, waiting patiently

He cannot see the floor is wet
Nor does he hear the strangers warn
He slips onto his back and lying paralyzed
He feels forlorn

The music begins and strangers whom he trusted
Leave him there
Helpless and immobile lying on the floor
And no one cares
But the voice that once was distant
Sounds as though it's right next to his ear
And no longer the shrieking does he hear

The voice says, ""Walk"" and suddenly
He knew he would
It says, ""Remove the blindfold"", suddenly he knew
He always could

But the voice it knows no time, waits patiently
Can't record a wrong, his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever, it'll still be there
Waiting jealously, waiting jealously

But the voice it knows no time, waits jealously
Can't record a wrong, his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever, it'll still be there
Waiting patiently

Enchant,"I look into a sea of blue in your eyes
And see a full and swollen moon
Resplendent in a stormy sky
I look through your gaze, its source is pure and uncorrupted
And see a wilderness of dunes, untouched,uninterrupted

Pessimis protects me
Limp hope won't let me down
Still i lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around

I swear,I won't unravel this time...
I banish ""too good to be true"" from my mind
I'm steeled in my resolve by this gem I never thought I'd find
The echoes of your laughter fall upon me,like the calming rain
They intimate a surreal world,smooth-surfaced and free of stain

Pessimis protects me
Limp hope won't let me down
Still i lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around
I swear,I won't unravel this time...

Enchant,"This is the ending of an age,the closing of a chapter that
Was just beginning...
Battered senseless, this is not what you deserve
Stripped and left defenseless, this is not what you deserve
Stabbed and left to die,all alone forsaken
Life palns gone awry, precious life blood taken
And your dignity is gone
You thought you had found something that was stable
Now you're finding you were wrong
And the promise made nothing but a fable
Blindsided, this is not what you deserve
Purposely misguided, this is not what you deserve
No foresight for this, words that kept you blind
Betrayed with a kiss, life plans undermined
And you'll never love again
You thought you had found something that was stable
Hearts can change just like the wind
So it's best to keep them safe beneath the table
Actions telling lies
Ring, an empty token
Formal-wear disguise
Vows recklessly broken

[Lyrics: T.Leonard]




",Blind Sided,1999
Enchant,"No quarter shall be called loud
His cries echo by, like a river's endless flow
To wear away the stone, carve his life like a knife
The scars he'll never show

Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts and lacking the will
I'm unstoppable, untouchable

The battle's just begun, he's standing ground
Tall and proud, despite the wind that blows
As most his comrades fall like toppled trees
In the breeze where roots none deep had grown
Roots none deep had grown

Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts lacking the will
I'm unstoppable, untouchable

In your dance of indecision
I never realized just how frail you'd be
Cracks have shown in your foundation
Castles made of sand crumble eventually

Soon the smoke will clear then we'll see
You and me, just who's king of the hill
The oceans swell with rage, earth did quakes
The bow may break, know I'll be standing still
I'll be standing still

Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts and lacking the will
I'm unstoppable, untouchable
I'm invincible, splintered hearts, untouchable

Enchant,"Can you look into my eyes before I look away?
Can you catch my gaze?
Can you see what's deep inside a lost and lonely man?
Can you understand that I wear a mask of fear?

To interact with the other side
Instead I act alone, decisions are my own
Look,listen
Me,myself and I - we will be all right
Living all alone in a dark and empty home
Just a loner trying to survive
Needing companionship to keep oneself alive
My body and soul are mine alone to share
Making conversation with someone who isn't there
If I could just
Interact,minds making contact
Interact,when chemicals react
How can you reach this burning man?
You sense his pain and passion, in a silent scream he cries
His tale is told through his eyes
You cannot look to long before you hear his song
Look,listen
Me,myself and I - we are doing fine
Kid myself I must,there's no one else I trust

But pride it comes before the fall
It's time I started believing

Broken by life's deceptions
Mended by one who saw through, ohh

Fall to the ground before you
My judgment came too late
I don't deserve forgiveness, ohh
My sins are far too great

There's no way to make this end
Words are of no value here

This need has got to be restrained

Where is the treasure? I know there is one

Fill this hole, seems like nothing can

No sign of blood
But this taste won't go away
Even if a wound does heal
Its scar might never fade

Unwelcome words can pierce
And drain the soul
Like aphids on the blossoms, leave a hole

Sometimes the heart and mind won't work together
And one gets left behind
While the other pulls ahead
Naive of where it treads

The residue of harmful words outlasts a seeming pardon
Little can undo the work of aphids in the garden

[Chorus:]
I can't believe that I hurt You with the words I've said
I can't conceive how I fooled my heart and lost my head
But as I watched with wonder as your jaw seemed to hit the ground
I realized that I stuck my foot right in my mouth
And what a big foot it is...

I wish that I could turn back time
Alter memory or pay some kind of fine
Anything to make amends
Fix this break to where it bends

The residue of harmful words outlasts a seeming pardon
Little can undo the work of aphids in the garden

Gazing at a rainbow, a brilliant vast array
Staggered by it's beauty, saddened by it's modest stay
Taken all for granted, or innocence betrayed
A lesson in mortality: eventually every color fades

The novelty of love, feelings within my clutch
I try to savor but it doesn't taste the same
Senses numbed and jaded a little day by day

She sets free momentarily
Everyone she sees

So this is what they've all talked about
So bountiful that you never run out, a love unmeasured
I feel her pain, I feel her delight
I feel removed from myself in her sight, an infinite treasure

She elates and illuminates
Every stranger's face
She sets free momentarily
Everyone she sees

I count the days till she looks at me
And says the words that she's heard so repeatedly
Then again I wish time would slow down

Enchant,"A sense of place, a sense of waste, don't know how this can be
The silence that envelops me whispers something subtly
Exhale and change the atmosphere
They've left a trace of their fear

[Chorus:]
How could something like this have happened in a place like this?
Such mindless violence
The surroundings hold their secrets
How could something like this have happened in a place like this?
A new day is here, but there's a trace of yesterday

Here the trees can speak in voices weak that suggest a tale of pain
Of tears shed in the pouring rain
But at that they halt their sad refrain
Look up at the vault of starts and the calming harvest moon
A witness to the unspeakable, and easily repeatable
Cry out to change the atmosphere
Some kind of presence is here

Red wine spilled on the carpet; we can clean it up
Tracks left on the beach that the tides wash away

There are traces of yesterday
This place is stained; what will it take to wash them away?",Traces,2000
Enchant,"Look in her eyes as if to say that she fears nothing
All knowing smile like nothing has changed
She thinks, I'm asleep while at night she goes on trembling
She thinks, I don't know how her life's been rearranged

Can't move my arms, can't move my legs
Can barely move my eyes
To take in the last view I'll ever see
It's on the stand beside my bed a picture of my son
It's constantly staring back at me
Want to tell him that I swear that if I can I'll be there
Watching over him and every step he takes

How do I say soon comes the day
When I must go away
What would adhere to a seven-year-old ear?
Words that would make it clear

I hope that you don't forget me
Don't let my memory fade, it's my greatest fear

My back is numb, my feet are cold
I fear that it's only a matter of time now
There's just one thing
I've got to muster the strength to say

Know that my love is forever
Know that and try to remember
Don't let my memory fade
Don't let my memory fade
Don't let my memory fade
Don't let my memory fade
Don't let my memory fade

So it's over

Stow away memories of yesterday

Run away, the truth you can't betray
Or pushover

Yeah, there's silence as we break
'Cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake

Look to yourself and do the same
Painful thing to admit
This puzzle piece just won't fit

But we tried, and we pushed so hard
'Til something had to give
Still we cried, and I screamed so loud
I'm sure you had to hear

Now my fingers bleed and I need some relief
Because my back it breaks
So, I let you down before you fall
But still my heart it aches

Judgment day, the good and bad we weigh
And look over
Cast away your negative display
And start over

Yeah, there's silence as we break

Enchant,"Some nights I lie in forced awakeness
My thoughts won't let me go
A sleep like death has claimed the world outside
The silence reshapes my solitude, from a refuge to a prison
Distractionless, nowhere to hide

Aloneness holds the mirror
I see things I just can't work through
Some things you'll never shine any light into
Like how to read what will be, from what has been
Like what's in store for me, and you

I wonder what my life will be
What lies ahead for the people close to me?
How can I make my peace with uncertainty 
In a sea of risk, swim with serenity?

Some nights my thoughts drag me to a cold, cold place: the dark side of mortality
Who will be the next to go -- their light blown out forever, in that merciless finality?

Lives are running novels; at times you read, at times you write
The choice of which to do might keep you awake at night
Should I just accept or act against this pressing moment
Should I run for cover or stand and fight?

I wonder what my life will be, a public failure or success in obscurity?
How can I make my peace with uncertainty -- in a sea of risk, swim with serenity?

I wonder what my life will be, what lies ahead for you and me?
Can I make my peace with uncertainty? I wonder what my life will be: I wonder:",In the Dark,2001
Enchant,"So safe within this cozy little cell
No risk at all throwing coins into a well
I lust for gold, but shutter at the price
Reward I want, but not the sacrifice

But my hands won't release the bow
I've been pulling back on it so long
I've forgotten how to let it go
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone
And I fear I won't succeed so I'm holding on

A life passes by, I watch passively
I'm haunted by time, my enemy
I fear that I'm bound, I fear that I'm free
And haunted by time, my enemy

I'm frozen by the fast approaching night
A dear that stares into oncoming light
It's time for me to come down from the fence
But either side invites a consequence

Waiting for the door to open wide
Waiting for the stones to find their place
The price it never seems to leave my hands
Intentions never help me in the race
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone

Enchant,"I was set loose as a child
To find my way out in the wild
Fell asleep inside a cage
And woke up in middle age

I felt like I was living a lie
And had to escape it all
With mortal fears I shaved off the years
And went from a walk to a crawl

I know I'm reaping what I've sown
But I never thought I'd die alone
I guess I signed up for this fate
By sowing the seeds of hate

And when I finally shook the phase
I was lost and miles away
Got too hard to turn around
I've left no bread crumbs on the ground

I felt like I should have apologized
But that was so overdue
And by your eyes knew I was despised
I guess I was afraid of you

I know I'm reaping what I've sown
But I never thought I'd die alone
I guess I signed up for this fate
By sowing the seeds of hate

So please believe this will that you read
That I thought of you everyday
I grant to you my hollow legacy
Please don't live your life this way

Authentically raw wit it, see I augmented this industry
To submit to my will, all attempts to limit me
Can kneel, peel caps wit ill raps
Nothing convenes here till your camp gets smeared like pap
What you tryin to tell me, skills never found me
Workin for peanuts amongst jelly MC's, really ain't my steez
Peep game
I plot on different ways to make these styles ricochet through main frames
The day-to-day theme is turn these fake teams gangreen
My main vein's the only thing about me mainstream
You doubt me like the foes of Noah, embarkin in this Ark, the soul controller
While fools caught up in this Del used to blow up
You're inundating wit the out-dated
See all of why'all fall when this cascade hits
Yo D, watch these watered-down clowns get drowned
And lounge sound broken down in Cuba
Tryin to build ships off shit they bit
I spit that major play saliva, taylor-made for cypher sole survivor
Pay the piper if you plan to go inside my covenant
Better come in two's, matta fact come a crew to get you back
Executives, we wet you wit the hymns that leave you and your man
Packin, attackin wit verbal cataclysms
Leavin the average rapper drenched and grab a trench 
Guard against my El Nino lingo

To be an end to his constant misery

The cross he bears around his neck

And so he prays for this to end

Tired and weakened now
Demons are his only company
So, give up the ghost
Ten years shy of a century

Till summer comes along
And in our winter world of love,
You see, we always will remember
That as the snow lay on the ground,
We found our winter world of love.

Because the nights are longer,
We'll have the time to say such tender things
Before each day.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

And then, when love is stronger,
Perhaps, you'll give your heart
And promise that we'll never part, oh, no.

I've known that girl for so long
I hope I'm not doin' wrong

To lose her from my mind somehow
For those she's gone, she haunts me now
I think I should make a start
To put her out of my heart

Give me another glass of wine
To heal this broken heart of mine
And help me ease my achin' mind 
Of all the sorrow

For now, the wine's the only way
To help me pass the lonely day
Afraid of sleepless nights
And broken dreams tomorrow

It seems an old familiar score
That girl has left me twice before
Not long ago in my dreams
My dreams have come true, it seems

She'll call me on the phone and then
She'll say she wants me back again
But this time it was the end
Can't stand this game of pretend

Engelbert Humperdinck,"Yesterday's world is a dream
Like a river that runs through my mind
Made of fields and the white pebble stream
That I knew as a child
Butterfly wings in the sun
Taught me all that I needed to see
For they sang, sang to my heart
""Oh look at me, oh look at me""
""Free as the wind, free as the wind""
""That is the way you should be""

Love was the dream of my life
And I gave it the best I know how
So it always brings tears to my eyes
When I think of it now
Gone like the butterfly days
And the boy that I once used to be
But my heart still hears a voice
Tellin' me ""look, look and you'll see""
""Free as the wind, free as the wind""
""That is the way you should be""

There's no regret that I feel
For the bittersweet taste of it all
If you love, there's a chance you may fly
If you fall, well you fall
Rather the butterfly's life
To have lived for a day and been free
For my heart still hears that voice
Tellin' me ""look and you'll see""
""Free as the wind, free as the wind""
""That is the way you should be""
""Free as the wind, free as the wind""
""That is the way you should be""",Free as the Wind,1974

Killing me softly with his song,

Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.
But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.",Killing Me Softly With His Song,1974

Engelbert Humperdinck,"I took my chances thinking something might be saved
Growing tired of broken promises
And dreams you never made
And I wanted to be more than just a friend
Not knowing I would hurt so in the end
So I swore I'd never call you home again

Took time to see through all the glitter that you made
I was blinded by your fire light
And swept myself away
And I guess I couldn't bring myself to see
You had taken all the very best of me
So I'm leaving while there's something left of me

Just like a child, I keep on running back for more
You know I thought I knew the answers
'Cause I've been hurt before
And one more time around won't break me
You will never see that side of me
No, no, no, no, I don't break easily

I told my service to pick up all my calls
And I've taken down our photographs
That lined our bedroom walls
And the outside door no longer has your name

All your clothes are gone
My welcome mat's been changed
But the key's still there
And I've left the door unchained

Just like a child, I keep running back for more

But my, oh, my, my, my, I'll take it all

When I say goodnight in your little room
The only place where we can be alone
When I say goodnight in your little room
To hold you close this way, you say is wrong

But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'

Until the morning light shines in your eyes
So love me now, we'll get along some how

She will hear a love song
And a melody
And even if the words are not so tender
She will always remember

And I laugh and hide the pain

She whispered softly to me love can hurt a thousand ways

And I tried to say I love you please don't go away
But all the time I knew you can't catch moonlight angels
And I saw her disappearing in the darkness of the night

When I tried to walk behind her just to find the Promised Land
There were no footsteps, footsteps in the sand

Marie
I can't bear to see the children without bread
Oh Marie
They deserve a decent roof above their heads
Trust me now
And when I leave for town, my darling, don't be sad
Or ask me how
But tomorrow, we're have all the things we never had
But if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun goes down
Take the train, change your name
And get the children out of town
Yes, if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun has gone
Forget me, my Marie
And move on
Marie
Ah, you've never had a new dress you could wear
Oh Marie
You look so pretty with a ribbon in your hair
For too long
You've gone without the life that I once promised you
Right or wrong
But today I'll find a way to make it all come true
But if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun goes down
Take the train, change your name
And get the children out of town
Yes, if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun has gone
Forget me, my Marie
And move on

So cry no more on the shore of dreams
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes and dream and you can be with me
Neath the waves through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out. let it all begin

Once a story's told it can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear

And it will be all right

Trust in your dreams, run with no fear
And if you should stumble remember I'm near
As a ghost I will walk, I'll look deep in my soul
I might find another, you gave me that hope

So as you kiss him in the moonlight
With heavy words I say

If you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever and the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free

Walk without my arm about you, Baby

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Quando eu abro a janela
Quando eu abro o jornal
Eu vejo a cara dela:
A Terceira Guerra Mundial
Jogam bombas em Nova Iorque
Jogam bombas em Moscou
Como se jogassem beijos pra torcida
Depois de marcar um gol
Falam tanto sobre guerra e paz
Mas tanto faz falar ou não
Todas as bombas e os generais
São restos mortais da civilização
Rebeldes sem rebeldia
Viciados em anestesia
Fantasmas sem fantasia
Gripados na guerra fria
Pão e circo, que pé no saco
Quem não fica frio, fica fraco
Procuro entender qualé a desses caras
Procuro um cigarro no bolso do casaco
Em todo lugar, um pedaço do fim
Um furo de bala, um muro de berlim
Muito sangue sai da tela do ""drive-in""
Um Filme de guerra, um filme sem fim

Somos quem podemos ser
Sonhos que podemos ter

Que as nuvens não eram de algodão
Um dia me disseram
Que os ventos às vezes erram a direção

Quem oculta o crime também
Quem duvida da vida tem culpa
Quem evita a dúvida também tem, também tem

Engenheiros Do Hawaii,"Hora do mergulho
(Humberto Gessinger)
Feche a porta, esqueça o barulho
Feche os olhos, tome ar: é hora do mergulho
Eu sou moço, seu moço, e o poço não é tão fundo
Super-homem, não supera a superfície
Nós mortais, viemos do fundo
Eu sou velho, meu velho, tão velho quanto o mundo
Eu Quero paz:
Uma trégua, do lilás-neon-Las Vegas
Profundidade: 20.000 léguas
""Se queres paz, te prepara para a guerra""
""Se não queres nada, descansa em paz""
""Luz"" - pediu o poeta
(últimas palavras, lucidez completa)
Depois: Silêncio
Esqueça a luz... respire o fundo
Eu sou um déspota esclarecido
Nessa escura e profunda mediocracia

Sabe exatamente onde vai parar

Mas não precisamos saber pra onde vamos
Nós só precisamos ir
Não queremos ter o que não temos
Nós só queremos viver
Sem motivos, nem objetivos
Nós estamos vivos e é tudo
É sobretudo a lei
Dessa infinita highway

Quando eu vivia e morria na cidade
Eu não tinha nada, nada a temer
Mas eu tinha medo, medo dessa estrada
Olhe só, veja você
Quando eu vivia e morria na cidade
Eu tinha de tudo, tudo ao meu redor
Mas tudo que eu sentia era que algo me faltava
E à noite eu acordava banhado em suor

Nós só queremos viver
Não queremos aprender o que sabemos
Não queremos nem saber
Sem motivos, nem objetivos

Só obedecemos a lei

Dessas que a gente nunca canta sem razão
Me diga, garota: será a estrada uma prisão?
Eu acho que sim, você finge que não
Mas nem por isso ficaremos parados

Estamos vivos, sem motivos
Que motivos temos pra estar?

Eu posso estar correndo pro lado errado

É inútil ter certeza

""não corra, não morra, não fume""
Eu vejo as placas cortando o horizonte
Elas parecem facas de dois gumes

Por isso não me acuse de ser irracional
Escute, garota, façamos um trato
Você desliga o telefone se eu ficar um pé no saco.

Em muito pouco tempo o fogo apaga tudo

Ontem a noite eu conheci uma guria
Já era tarde era quase dia
Era o princípio
Num precipício, era o meu corpo que caía
Ontem a noite, a noite tava fria
Tudo queimava, nada aquecia

Parecia que era minha aquela solidão
Ontem à noite eu conheci uma guria
Que eu já conhecia de outros carnavais
Com outras fantasias
Ela apareceu, parecia tão sozinha
Parecia que era minha aquela solidão
No início era um precipício
(um corpo que caía)
Depois virou um vício
Foi tão difícil acordar no outro dia
Ela apareceu, parecia tão sozinho
Parecia que era minha aquela solidão

No fim das contas as nações unidas 
'Tão sempre prontas pra desunião 

Não tenho medo de perder você 
Desde o início eu sabia 
Era só questão de dias 
Um dia iria acontecer 

Preciso beber qualquer coisa 
Não me lembre que eu não bebo 
O que só nós dois sabemos 
Nós sabemos que é segredo 

Há um guarda em cada esquina 
Esperando o sinal 
Pra transformar um banho de piscina 
Numa batalha naval 

Agora sinto um medo infantil 
Mas na hora certa afundaremos o navio 
Então dê um copo de aguardente 
Para um corpo sentindo frio 

Preciso beber qualquer coisa 
Você sabe que eu preciso 
E o que só nós dois sabemos 
Já não é mais segredo 

Se alguém, seja lá quem for 
Tiver que morrer, na guerra ou no amor, 
Não me peça pra entender 
Não me peça pra esquecer 

Não me peça para entender 
Não me peça pra escolher 
Entre o fio ciumento da navalha 
E o frio de um campo de batalha 

Chegamos ao fim do dia 
Chegamos, quem diria? 
Ninguém é bastante lúcido 
Pra andar tão rápido 

Chegamos ao fim do século 
Voltamos enfim ao início 
Quando se anda em círculos 
Nunca se é bastante rápido","Filmes de Guerra, Canções de Amor",2005

It had to be you.

The wind was cold we huddled together
Looking back I should have known better
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look what I've done.

Gone too far, I don't know how I did it
Gone too far and I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Gone too far, there's nothing I can do now
Gone too far, it'll work out somehow
But I spend all my time thinking of you

Seems before, I didn't know what was missing
Maybe I did, but I just wouldn't listen
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look What I've done.

Gone too far, I don't know how I did it
Gone too far and I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you

Maybe somewhere along the line
I knew it would happen to me
Now I look in those smiling eyes
And for days now that's all I can see",Gone Too Far,1979
England Dan & John Ford Coley,"Met you on a springtime day
You were mindin' your life
And I was mindin' mine, too
Lady when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation
And, darlin' that's when I knew...
That it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Oh, I wake up in the night
And I reach beside me
Hopin' you will be there
But instead I find someone
Who believe in me when I said
""I'd always care""
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
So I lived my life in a dreamworld
For the rest of my days
Just you and me walkin' hand in hand
In a wishful memory
Oh, I guess that's all
That it would ever be
Wish I had a time machine
I could make myself go back
Until the day I was born
And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that I'll be
Your's from now on
Oh it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along",It's Sad to Belong,1979
England Dan & John Ford Coley,"Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore

But there's no easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls

Love is the answer (let it shine)
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer (you know the answer is love)

Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?
What are the chances?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers

And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
When you're all alone, love one another
When you're far from home, love one another
When you're down and out, love one another
All your hope's run out, love one another
When you need a friend, love one another
When you're near the end, love
We got to love, we got to love one another

Light of the world, you got to shine on me

Shine on us all (know that love can save the day)

England Dan & John Ford Coley,"The morning clouds are gathering around as I stand on the bridge of the river
Years have gone since I was here and I wonder how I differ
Taxicabs keep rolling by and a blind man asks for change
And here I stand a soldier in the rain.

Coming home was all I thought of ... seeing my family and friends
They say love knows no distance but the lonely never ends
And all along the dreams that possessed my heart never were to plain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain

I remember years ago? I had so many plans
And now I watch the river flow ? time has brought me here
With empty hands
I remember years ago? I had so many plans

And now I watch the river flow? time has brought me here
With empty hands
The morning clouds are gathering around and the streets are full of reflections

I've thought about why I'm here its just too hard to explain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain",Soldier in the Rain,1979
England Dan & John Ford Coley,"Many highways I've been on
Since I went out chasing a song
And I left you standing alone
In the soft morning sunlight

Now the summer's just like it was then
You were waving goodbye in the wind
And I heard you ask if I intend to ever settle down

Lady
Do you still seek the mysteries of life?
Or have you become some businessman's wife?
And do you still long to be free?
Lady
When you stare up at the stars out in the night
Do you still think this old world could turn out right?
And do you ever think of me?

The moon lit and danced on your hair
We sat for some time on the stairs
And I'd give anything that we could share
Those moments once again

But I'm surrounded by velvet and gold
And strangers who offer their souls
But they all seem so hollow and cold
When I remember you

Lady
Do you still seek the mysteries of life?
Or have you become some businessman's wife?
And do you still long to be free?

England Dan & John Ford Coley,"If I could only touch your heart
Maybe I could feel what you're going through
If I could only read your thoughts
Maybe I know what I need to do
Something's pulling us together
Something's stronger that we knew

It's part of me, part of you
Reaching out for part of something new
Loving me, loving you
And I wonder if you feel it too
I wish I knew

If I could feel the way you feel

England Dan & John Ford Coley,"Take us to the prisoner
Let us gaze into his eyes
To see what kind of man
It takes a nation to despise
Take us to the prisoner
Let us look upon his face
To see why twenty thousand men
Would gladly take his place
Won't someone give a drink to him?
Remove the chains and let him live, let him live

Take us to the prisoner
Let us listen to his voice
To see why worlds of wisdom's
In a cell without a choice
Take us to the prisoner
Torn and bent beneath the chains
We wonder if the world is really
Worthy of his name'
Won't someone give a drink to him?
Remove the chains and let him live, let him live

We know where we're going
For we heard the new winds blowing
And we're got to know for ourselves
It won't help to listen to someone else

Take us to the prisoner
With his eyes so full of grace
The priests have lied
And kings have died
Filled with their own disgrace
Won't someone give a drink to him?
Remove the chains and let him live
Let him live
Let him live

England Dan & John Ford Coley,"Tonight I'll board the Delta Queen
Abound for New Orleans
And again I'll get that feeling that I'm free
Her paddle wheels will churn
And her smoke stacks they will burn
And slowly I'll be carried to the sea

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

I know every river ship 'cause I've taken every trip
And I know every captain by his name
In the eyes of every man, I can tell what's in his hand
I guess that I have played in every game

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

Tonight I'm a-sittin' here beneath a chandelier
There's a lady here to light my big cigar
And if luck will be my friend, we'll be finished up by ten
And we'll be standin' on the decks beneath the stars

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

'Cause I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
I make my livin' on the run
I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

I'm a rambler, a showboat gambler
Big Muddy will always be my home

I would not go through all this pain
I'd find someone else

Some things take some time

I spend with you again

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow-ow-ow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, lo-o-ong ago

Heaven canno-ot hold him, nor-or earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
Lord Go-od A-almighty, Je-esu-us Christ

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day
A brea-east full of milk, and a manger full of hay
Enough for Him, Whom angels fa-a-all before
The ox and ass and camel whi-ich a-adore

Angels and arc angels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thro-onged the air
But for hi-i-is mother, in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the Belove-ed wi-ith a-a kiss

Wha-at can I give him, poor-oor as I am
If I were a shepherd, I would give a lamb
If I were a wise man, I would do my part
But wha-at can I gi-ive Him, gi-ive my heart...
