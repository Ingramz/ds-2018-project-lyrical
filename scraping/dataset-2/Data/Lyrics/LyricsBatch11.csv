Adrina Thorpe,"In a world of desire
oh who would come and catch you when you fall
in the wind and the fire?
oh who would come to save you?

High above any danger
Locked inside the tower of your mind
dreams are veiled; passion blinded
Safe from fear and fire

Oh who will find me?
In your midnight eyes I see a summer sunrise
Fly far beyond these silver winter skies
I see a beautiful life Oh come and get away

Do you see the horizon?
Walk upon the water you will find
all is still and yet alive
in the morning light

Oh who will find me?
In your midnight eyes I see a summer sunrise
Fly far beyond these silver winter skies
I see a beautiful life Oh come and get away

Dance dance in the morning light
Open your darkened eyes
Hey hey it’s a beautiful day
It’ll be ok It’ll be ok

Take a look spin around this is where I find you… where the roses bloom
Leave your cares leave your fears leave them all behind you… yeayah
It’s a beautiful day in the city of shining light
It’s a beautiful day This is where I find you, yeah yeah",Who Will Find Me,2007

Adult Choir,"[Chorus:]
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 

[Chorus]

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you

Advent,"I will testify though I walk this road alone
Though all my brothers fade away, I will hold to you

Conviction has stripped away with time
The flame of passionate love
That once burned deep inside has blown away
And washed out with the rain

The tower of your faith has crumbled to the ground
Crushing those that held to you
And in your place, we dug a shallow grave
Hoping to see a change, a resurrection

And so we fight for the heart
Holding nothing back till we see the sun on the horizon
Bringing light to this barren wasteland, power of ages old
Held in the mighty hands of God
Pushed out and thrown away like a painful memory

Two feet in the grave we march relentlessly
Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation
Two feet in the grave we march relentlessly
Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation

Broken in two, our faith has fallen victim to shame
Run from the truth, run from the freedom of absolutes

Is there anyone left who still cares?
Reconcile, take back our stolen hearts
Reconcile, take back what is rightfully yours

Set apart
Set us apart, set us apart
Set apart our hearts only for you

Advent,"I'm sorry, so sorry
That I was such a fool
I didn't know love could so cruel

You tell me mistakes
Are part being young,

I'm sorry, so sorry
Please accept my apology,

But love is blind
And I was too blind to see",I'm Sorry,2006

What it could be like,
And I was all set to come back home.
You were after nothing I could give long.
Have you ever wondered,
What it could be like,
And I was standing back on my feet.
There's nothing there,
So now you want better

And I know I should have held you closer,
And I know I should have treated you better,
In a perfect world,
But we're not always,
What we promised to be.
You caught my words in mid-air.
The silence hung as you caught my eye,
Conversations locked away in my mind.

I know I should have held you closer,
I know I should have treated you better.

And I know I should have treated you better

Adxette,"In a time where the sun descends alone,
I ran a long long way from home
to find a heart that's made out of stone.

I will try,
I just need a little time
to get your face right out of my mind,
to see the world through different eyes

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why?
When I scream there's no reply,
when I reach out there's nothing to find,
when I sleep I break down and cry

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Fading like a rose,
fading like a rose,
beaten by the storm,
talking to myself,
getting washed by the rain,
it's such a cold cold town.",Fading Like a Flower [Alex K Remix][Live],2005
Ady Suleiman,"A sad story, might find it boring
Lost his mum to a drug named Heroin
Father's gone, so grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin
I never really knew him when he was growing up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up to
Just a brother whom I knew was a dodgy fuck
Shit, I used to think he was a dick
Tried too hard to fit
And never grow out of it

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Never left his home town
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
That he didn't want to go and get it
Occupied by fitting in where minds
A small west, small things
Make the small things feel so tall
Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
It wouldn't help his case
Oh, I couldn't ever say

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

But wait my life's out, a night out
Brothers in town, some doubt, a few fights
Now kicked out clubs, shit the suns up
One look's all it took for his girl to cuss at another
Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girl's man decides to clench his fists
And then he threw and missed
Brother's hit, as did his
Dropped him quick, then one kick to the head
Oh shit other man is dead

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

And now he's locked away
Twenty-one years of age
How many lives must go to waste?
As far as graves
Until I see some fucking change
And I don't even know how
We continue to
Fight one another now

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
 
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough

E a vontade que não tenha fim, este sol

I wrinkle in my mind another fear
With ears beside the bedroom door
I close my eyes to keep inside the tears

Where's my Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same

He loves and then he hurts some more
It takes a generous man to lose something
Will I know what it means to see the pain through different eyes?
But nothing seems to work this time
I'll live inside the burden till I've healed

I'm still Pablo at the park
I'll find Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same

But nothing seems to work this time
I'm still Pablo at the park
And I've got Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much

Like goldfish in a bowl

I stand on a distant shore
The turning tide
Breathes all the mystery of you...

O my dreams
Are lost with the autumn leaves
That turn to gold
That fall in the memory of you...

Mists of Avalon 
Cover my heart
Carry my voice on the wind
Over the waters that keep us apart
I will remember you still...
I will remember you still...

Aer,"She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you
She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you

When she's drunk she calls me a punk
She blow my phone up, she don't know what's up
When she drink that Jack
She won't call back, and when she off that rum
She acts so dumb
She tells me grow up! I say you know what?
She won't let me finish, she starts to go nuts
Stop throwing stuff, time to own up
I'm so done baby I'm so done
All I need to do is turn my back, and she'll be gone for good
Finished packing my bags, going where I know I should
It's only right for me to move on to what's next
But when she texts me with those three words it gets me like

She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you
She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you

She's gotta quit showing off to all of her friends
And go pick someone else who can handle her shit
I'm so sick of this and I can't pretend
But I'll be stuck with this girl like wet cement, yeah
I don't want her following in my footsteps
But I think my shadow needs it
Despite her good side, and some good sex
I'd rather go through amnesia
Like forget all about it
No reason to always get so dramatic
I'm more manual, she automatic
Oh oh
Tryna get rid of her static
I got smacked last night, it makes sense tonight
Well it's time to tell her I've had enough

She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you
She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you

Take my hand
Let's start new
I wasn't planning on it but I'm likin' you
And we just met
But I get you
You seem like the type that got something to prove
Come on and dance
Let's see you move
This ain't the first time that I noticed you
Take off those heels
Let's keep um new
Now bring that body closer for a few

Aerobic-Stars,"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long.
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song.
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed.
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read:

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean.
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine.
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad.
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad.

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne.
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape.
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape.""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place.
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face.
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew"".

""That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
You're the love that I've looked for, come with me, and escape.""

Bare backed, riding like a running man, nightmares,
And he can't hold the candle to my dreams!

We flew into burning skies, the thunder and rain, and finally realized,
What it is, what it does, and what it come to say!

No, no, no, no, then came the light.

No stablize,
No one try to please,
Nobody's eyes.

And then they go get stiff

Cause nothing gonna change
If we stay around here

We gotta do what it takes
Cause it's all in our hands
We all make mistakes
But it's never too late to start again

Take another breath
And say another prayer

And fly away from here
Anywhere, I don't care
We'll just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

We won't let them pass us by
We'll just fly

If this life, gets any harder now
Don't ever mind, you got me by your side
And any time you want
We can catch a train and find a better place
Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down

Maybe you and I
Should pack our bags and say goodbye

And fly away from here
Anywhere, I don't care
We'll just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams
Are out there somewhere

We won't let times pass us by
We'll just fly

You could have a better life now

They can try but we won't let them

Spent my nights awake and I wonder

I will end up lost in confusion

Plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great
Wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks
If I gotta go blind I'mma do it for the love of all television kind
And that's fine, and that's fine

Make me a star, I want to touch gold
Hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen
Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
Crucify my little future to the monitor
Damn it feels good, turn on, tune in
Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
But the children seem to love it
Yes mother, me and wild discovery
And heard the static flock to where I sleep

By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
Tangled in the star spangled wiring
I can turn from toxicated visuals
And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
F*** the fortress
Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
I'll be dead by morning anyway
Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
I want commercials twenty four-seven
I want to shop from my bed and set an
Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren
I bond with a six string ? correspondence
And lurking circuitry circus

With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
Channel zero addict, immaculate
It goes big screen, little screen, any screen'll do
Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you
Plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze
Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
I want to see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance
So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance

Plug it in, turn it on, silent fix better than nothing
Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest
Touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something?
Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon
Fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom

It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention
But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences
Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me
Your majesty, I love you, I despise you

Aesop Rock,"Well, so we meet again
(He said he's grown spiritually since the last one)

OK, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
Where the jackals sit and watch the pedigods last flesh
Poison functions accompanied by six armor clad
Black horse and buggy mechanism
Tugged a portion of my severed vision
The gathering of loose ends in a bucket
Wit a shoestring budget
Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now)
But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen
Fee fie et cetera
I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'
I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home
I get sprung with a vibe and alliance of clean intention
By eclipsing doom midigons hatched to bash these picket fences
Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sword festering
Now when the groom presents the ring
The bride commence to blistering
This textbook magnificently crude
Prototype king berserker modulate
Serve the vertical thirst, burst horizontal
Treasure, loose cannons span the star bit power
The clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure
Cabin fever meter pegging ludicrous
Beautiful cartoon trooper
swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
I rock ready aim fire, while y'all rock ready fire aim
Then blame the stationary target when the prey escapes the frame
Merit badge marksman, a poacher, it's all the same
So I lay across the woods perpendicular to the grain

I gotta be a big bang, gotta be
Never want to be hear a probably, I want to see or hear a ""Yes sir, sir""
YES SIR!
Armed with a tome, cross, sore to the bone
Warn the other brothers that was born forlorn
Big bang, sharper than a big dick
Hotter than a tunnel of big dreams that think big things

I'm just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population
Bottle neck effect, sorta born deaf
Alien of shallow alchemy
If you gon' meta-morph the basemetal to precious
Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants
I'm floating the homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window
Left an SOS infested bottle nestled in his grip so
With a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow
I observed him fly ten feet then dropped the bottles to the devils
Fertile circle turn pertal crescent via bad investment
Despised every second, but I GUESS I LEARNED MY LESSON!
If I made an angel in the snow for every rotted victim
There'd be wings to float this mother ship up out the goblin system
Sticky panoramic contaminate planet
In conjunction with phantom assumption
Gutterbug alumnus candidates
Well, I promise you I man the lighthouse
Just to help guide in your ship
If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)
Godspeed, straitjacket and ragged approach
To circle suns via folklore pollutants to rhyme strictly
From a BC generation disgust
Community movement alluding to a
""No blood given, no recognition""
Life matter, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer
Trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams are gathered

OK, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bare the others farewell
I shook the buddy system wisdom till the similar repel
I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwits syndicate jackals
I'm broken arrow to the fuckin' bone (broken poem)
I don't really believe in God
But God, I'm scared to death of God?
I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans
Nor tear the pod
It's like  I hike an acre unimpressed
And slept on the saber's edge
Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge
I want to know myself
Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves
And still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls
I push the ghouls to man overboard
Pull the bulls onto my sword
And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor
Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
Got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, slide over
The recipe's design unplug the appetite continuity
By stitching together esteemed congruent (beautifully)
I peel back carts and lodge Greek physics in the chambers
Quartarized the wound and heads like ""Gimme gimme something major""

Aesop Rock,"Verse One:

The harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
I imagine sloppy seed handling avoke the stroke of tardy planting
And the crops we'd have harnessed in mid November
It only brushed the blossom bracket then soon sacrificed
Lives to icicle jackets when the frosted
I sunk to find the walk beneath the mosses
Where the planted tunnel pass after the rains have run their courses
But alas the portraits of these frosted corpses tortured in the grass
Off of distorts or pour the one tall glass and nauseous
And I'm asking you, why's this spy supply hiding in strangers
When they know atop the food chains I could spot biters for acres
Now be gracious, these minstools turn a bully's psycho civil
By dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
Yelp bringing the self-stop freedom brigade investors
And the studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
Puts it down, and it's down beneath your sappy sing alongs
So stick it further down where the daunted decide which ring I'm on
Nova yell just took positions and advance march
Parts playing a scheme parking the rain in my canteen now I'm like
Point I guess I could spare a splash for a couple of heads
Counterpoint during my famine I never got broke your bread
Well equation of intrigue, yes, yes, let me fed sit for a bit
These 'tensils need soaking before I hand out token
""Shut the fuck up"" drama like Kabuki with a heart of dirt
Skull fucked cross bones hence my birth it hurts

Chorus:

Must not sleep must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut
And I'm like must not sleep must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I'm trying to walk on top of sunshine
But it's ridiculous at times that's why I tore 'em with this warning

Verse Two:

Wanting the glory of our advance fire ants to water beetles
Free masons adjacent debasing on pins and needles
Pupil turned pedagogue benedicts into my dream
Beam in a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
I pluck the pedals off a classic blood rose one at a time
Gripping the stem and right invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
A metaphor for nighttime, ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
To salute the moon of our paradise lost and you're a spectator
Stringent, inch by sacred inch shoveling colon in my earthworm soul
Borough up through the dirt with bloody digit lick my knuckles clean
Noting the corporate clusters holding hands round the abode of the dam
And what's your poison? Starlight and amaze her with a nicotine chaser
Sip it clean savor the taste then sit and dream later
The ollage pay their back upon they hinges twenty miles
Across the glassy eye window of one less to passes by
Now I'm six foot four with a sick flow walk up just to recline
With no free time, the alarm storms at nine
My daytime's on some, yes sir, okay sir, right away sir
Sir do you mind if I breathe sir oh you do? Well excuse me sir fuck you
I breathe slow, I'm running with these fantastic amalgams
Painting casket bound careers to pierce gunning with classic albums
Security's the javelin, catch it; labor
Clocked in at seven six and haven't clocked out ever since

Chorus:

Must not sleep must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I milk my habitat for almost everything I want
Sometimes I take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut
And I'm like must not sleep must warn others
Trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
I'm trying to walk on top of sunshine

Aesop Rock,"I'm twice born, once and seven something
Once is the resurrection of honorable function
Been shoveling a coal as the engine's doctor
Long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in a posture 
The metenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
Was, is, and forever will be a luxury
I'm a soubrette columnist fathering doom document
Cursed version of a certain Virgin Mary womb occupant

[Verse One]
I know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
Sure it's blurry may have had them speeennnd breeezzzzze
Stuck until my friend leaves puppet for the plummet committee
Sputtering bum numb enough to stomach the city
Who's that hugging a silhouette of willows with a hill's crest pan out?
On the candy coated crab apples, sugar dipped deadpan outs
I got a plan, I'll turnaquet my quest
Defeat a needle into battling to mute the mess
With patience galas with absentee balance I shove in the button
Strutting to exhibit mankind's hostility function
With a, ppppppppp paling in comparison a methias Goliath
Live to riggedy frame in a wicked silence
I top and ate my nameless square then I bumped eyelids
With a Christ we saw the same thing through a second
What's that? The grand mosaic depicting historical glory in a legend
Nurse me through the time stick and stone mixes hex my fertile crescent
Now all's well, I'm laughing on the inside I swear
Just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
My imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
So every second the discontent's locked accordingly
Let's turn mummy's shut up affection a berserk glory condition
And pray for the day a star child tugs the ribbon
Meddle in a two-hand grip when that spoon full of sugar medical chaser
Credible crasser antidote's terrible taste the
Water with a stolen soul pen left picture mad rhythm pinned
Never set a grin and fly health
Consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid plan of fabrics
I deemed practical, now is you is or is you ain't compatible
I feel a wind in my opinions plus hyper clutch
Crush one's ginger bread tenement awful,
It's like the date of Grado Methasawmill
A lifeline of spectacular expansion leaves the reaper
At the hand of what man's hand jokes
My friend's got a book about dreams, I look and laugh
I dream a book about my friends and still can't decipher the half
Ch-chatter boooox, now let a soothe sayer major
Cater to a king green battered on the brink of disease
I am, skin and bones, I am, sin and poems, I am, tin and chrome
You grin and groans fuck it I'm tinted when accrete zone
Blow the pedals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
And felt as if I'd actually accomplish something  
Fortify the bullies of the jokes soaking in treatment
Sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
On a ghost up in a fuse a lot second before the cock dropped
In the Styx and stared him down until he fixed it

Fashion, it's cool and all but what about God?
 [Oh God, well he's the man, but what about reading?]
What, like novels, man that don't hold my attention, what about television?
 [Television hurts my brain, how about walking in the rain?]
I hate walking, it's boring, how about some old fashioned gone fishin'
 [Yeah, fishing's great but I can't stand hooking the bait, lets dance]
I've got too left feet plus motion sickness, how about breakfast?
 [Man, I'm hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money]

Let's sell lemonade [Let's drink]

I'll make the waterfall out of order in autumn saw the quarter
When the gods mimic the vintage knuckle drag sacked in a coffin
I affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
Clattering the yesterday ain't shed a tear since
Hear me, wrote the Old Yeller community cartoon
The carousel balloon extravagant aware, inviting it
I'm swore to Adam and matter and saddling
Warhead thorax and abdomen to primitive horse back galloping
My index fingers rest in my talisman branded up in the jackals skin
One must pardon yee old common street detour
Weaving graceful through the prom directed column
Greater virus retreats to a lot in Valom
Bean stalk where the fiend walk and my name is mud
But that's got a ring to it so my swill welcomes the flood
I walk through God's practical joke on man practically broke
And if they raise my rent again I'll spend my nights practically soaked
Who spits silk dimensions with a noose looped by the raft?
After lack of reasoning jedi 3, 2, 1,
Oooh I'm hung, I've clung to hope but see you in hell
I'll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt

Aesop Rock,"[Aesop Rock]
Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolesent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self pride at Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the hot that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self pass the word, eyeing stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And someone, I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like 
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffiene team players 
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel heartstring Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding ""Gimme that""
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, ending
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It can roast my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
'cause every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general 
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pasttimes 
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage 
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Your response, dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in 
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God it's the year of the underpaid employee

And trying to rape earth on my off time

So you can run run run

With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
'Why Is It Like This!' Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals]
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution
(I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)
Abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)
Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing
Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it)
Table talk, salt and pepper conversation
Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca
It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do

Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, act of development first of madness

Steadily searching for something new under the sun

In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts and ravelin, pacing

I apologize for the faulty academics
But they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the face lift
Just ain't working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
To intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
Together specimens from the promise land
This for the thinkers
This for the merchants allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions

Fending tragic fatality successful dodging violets

Saw the wicked war phantom mansion beyond the pickets
The house next door to when the stick ball clears the fence

Pterodactyl circling turtle
I bite the bullet in a wingspan shadow
Suck and rust the oxygen gulps
And spit the metal directly back up the barrel
We ice grill the silhouettes (right)
The common decency factors a low ball estimate of zero
My testament is striking B-boy stances
Dancing past the foggy mirror
With wipes clean the billy goat beard, camouflage the spirit

Aesop Rock,"Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was joshua, age 10
Bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree, and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo
parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passers-by
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attachin lines to concrete
But she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
""Hey little Lucy, want to come jump double dutch?""
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
""I'm busy, thank you much""
Well, well, one year passed
And believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk,
And she stopped-
""Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today??""
She said:
""I'm not giving in, I'm finished,"" and walked away

(Chorus: x2)
1 2 3
That's the speed of the seed
A be	 see
That's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream
Or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it
'cause dreamers always chase
But never get it

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
(Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors,
Actin nice, although she was a strange girl, really
Say, ""Lucy, want to join me for some lunch??""
Lucy would smile and say ""I'm busy, thank you much""
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'cause while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece

(Chorus x2)

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed, 'bout 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock o' nothin
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
""Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you want to do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So i've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!""
Well!
The nurse jumped back,
She'd never heard Lucy even talk,
'Specially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died.

I got a job at a business place I chose not to name
Ask me how did I achieve this so quick? Yes you may
Back when I was  compiled a stunning resume
I didn't value way back then, but boy it helped today
I'm pushin' every single thought of rebellin' away
I'm workin' real hard, and my pockets are swellin', and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams, I swear she's meant for me
We've been together over 2 years, goin' on 3
We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be

Blackjack, big spender
He was married once
Till he bet her ring finger
Seen leaving Las Vegas
With a pick up truck, diamond
forty large, and beautiful wife piece
Than what he came with
Itched to get rich found nickels in the couch
Hitched back to the casino with in an hour
Said ""I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents""
And was immediately shot to his death over debts

By the EMS survived
Said that he could be revived but they lied
Afterlife realized that water from the skies
Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise

Once sought a life thought it right to write about

I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar
No cell
But hell, you jump the bar so well
Parted your partners veil and dipped
I'm New York harbor
Tale of a sail, ripped sorta
Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace
But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday
Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway
He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wow
Same one she used to hold in both smiles
? instinctual last shout if it killed me
So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free
One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back
Sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks
They never missed it
Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the sink
Shoebox, with a flicks of lipstick
I'll love you forever, 'cause you know me better
For the record, at one time, would have married you in a second
But killed all our kindling dreams, and never get the friendship
Or else by the time the stress wears out we'll both be dead and friendless",11:35,2003

Kings at the ready
Now the walls won?t win

Aesop Rock
Storms on the harbor, like a harbinger of bore
Gore?s my harbinger, pardon the art of war
Get your door?s darkened by the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus or
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Take important conference calls
In corner office walls
Stealin buckets
A bunch of these punch numbers
Five punch just say no to company functions
And I duck into the dungeons
Nothing says kill it 
Like a day of pinching paperclips and staplers for the privilege
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I?m boredom with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent?
Day job great
Make rap records matter fact thanks!
Peace!

In a getaway car 
In a getaway car, car, car, car

In a getaway car

In a getaway car, car, car, car


Six in the morning
And the walls close in
High noon calls
And the walls on him
Kings at the ready
Now the walls won?t win

I?m leaving?

Aesop Rock,"[Dead men tell no tales.
Up push the daisies till the soil is stale
In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale
Mr. big sleep with the carp and kelp]

Once upon a time in the days of yore
When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
Peg leg navigator starboard to port
By the nautical star of male an the harbor is yours
And you should tell them where you situate the gold
That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy j-j-j-Jones.

Like ""walk the plank"" for whom the shark thank
Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs.
Come all the shiny spoils piled higher every year
He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
Ten summers prior on a night like this
Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
Swore it blew him a kiss
When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
F-f-f-fish.

""What the heck!"" grabbed for his telescope
Shatter gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
To deck circled the vessel the 360 swiftly
Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey.
Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar,
He'll be the laughing stock of the barbary coast war
Like this dude either got two glass eyes
Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side

Now he knew what he saw
But had to prove he was raw
So he raped and he pillaged and
And he'd feud and he'd brawl
Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
And battle always find him though he never told cutthroats
Meanwhile, back in the now, Got a brand new skeleton crew
On the move out When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth

Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed.
And he was aching from his boots to the feather in his cap
Till his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
One look down and lept off the dock,
See if you can guess where X marked the spot
The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave,
Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid.

Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much.
Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
But see the vitamin deficiency was strong
So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
An area high tide so grand it's the one that put the one that put
The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land

I wish I could tell you that it ended happy
Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water.
No lie, scout's honor, got a million more
From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
Before your visions of grandeur go to slow those sails
Remember that dead men tell no t-t-t-tales",The Harbor Is Yours,2007
Aesop Rock,"(for want of a name the shoe was lost)
(for want of a shoe the horse was lost)
(for want of a horse the rider was lost)
(for want of a rider the battle was lost)
(for want of a battle the kingdom was lost)
(and all for the want of a horse shoe...)

There is a hole in front of the shovel, shovel in front of the brawn
Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
Each withered his mule-ish days to choose his tool of trade
Dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames
If you would clue the crew into the civil
Just get the food and land like you the man who flew the coop over the pit-bulls
Dash back flashy to compassionate nano police
Sat beneath an avalanche and jagged and nautical seas
And I would stop the violence more than I was Pontius Pilate
Cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
A is gullible he figure all man equal no brainer
Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
Moms raised the babies through a very church-y eighties
Sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of Haties
And he brazen but apparently infernal bound now
For when a man had coughed recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck
Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
Observing how the giveth is disproportionate to the taketh away decide to maketh his day
All the stoic odium glowing a coal holster
When he coulda stood easily in the tub juggling toasters

[Chorus]
No mountain too high
No city too far
No coma tonight
No city tomorrow
No fire too live
No city too charred
To treaty to sign
No city to guard

I pick the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
Skin crawlin off the drawl and now it clawed the awkward tone up
I'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive
Coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
Holmes, the barnicles that chew upon the flesh of man
Have clued into suitor's capital to a beggars hand
Comfortably, sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat
Umm, what? !?
The chinny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma
Along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer
Now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver
If you make no friends on the way to the top rung
There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck
But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons
All kings hang em for the cliff side drip dry
Will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive
If he live, will he survive the milligrams of middle ground
They pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town
Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles
Dipped in military hells bells and whistles
Riders to the east
Now the wild tribes
Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miled high

Aesop Rock,"Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'mma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, but the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass
None shall pass
 
Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
'Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready, go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass
None shall pass

You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve

Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this
Duty and death; anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.y. Chew through the machine

Check horizons, read the flight plan
Spread the lifespan
Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps
We only try to get free from the spider's web
Gotta murder all the messing around
Carry the burden of work, never setting it down
With a spot like now, my shot, my chance
Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants

I'm packing double, getting up too early
I'm actually trouble, kind of acting 7: 30
Attracted to this Earth, maybe acting kinda worldly
But running on my work that says ""Ev I better hurry""
I'd rather worry death than being pushed in the line
Still a perfect ?, never late when I fly
Epic ? so this time when I rhyme
Not an ounce of death dying, stay late to the sky
Late for my prime, something that was shaped by design
I been running while the others hurt from racing a line
Making it great coincides with making it mine
Coincides with the hate that I'm making in signs
Let me start from the beginning, I rewind to the top
Pitch my heart in every inning like I did with the ?
And it don't stop, a body in motion stays in motion
Coasting in between the wings of this flowing

From a chicken wire frame
And a house of wax
To a rocket exploding into a cloud of bats

And train tunnels moving through people like a Peterbilt

Sneak around a thousand crows peppering the front lawn

Så nu går man ut gymnasiet och ekonomin den är lika med noll

Eller så jobbar man svart japp mellan morgon och natt

Putting people in faceless categories.
Knowledge isn't what it used to be.
Military tactics to control a nation.
Who wants to be a president or king? Me!
Mother Nature is gonna work against you.
Nothing in your power that you can do.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
You and I know it, the Bible tells you.
If we don't start to look for a better life,
The world will be destroyed in a time zone!
Iæ?¦ in a time zone (x3) Speak about destruction (x1) Iæ?¦ in a time zone (x3)
Speak about destruction (x1)

Afrika Bambaataa,"I'm gonna kick 'em out

Well I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby
'Cause we all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy now, baby

I know how you want it, child,
Hot, sweet, and tight
The girls can't stand it
When you're doing it right When they're up on the stand
And then they kick out the jams, yes
Kick out the jams, I like to kick 'em out

Yes I'm startin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feelin'
And the sound that abounds and
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
When you get the feelin'
You've got the sounds above
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Yes, kick out the jams, got to kick 'em out

So you got to get it up
And then can't get enough
That's what  ?
'Cause it gets in your brain
It drives you insane, makes you crazy
The ? the faster you funk
If you wanna feed my rocket
Till the morning comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yes kick out the jams
I done kick 'em out",Kick out the James,1986

Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 
Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
On down through the Middle Ages 
When the earth kept going through changes 
There's a business going on, cars continue to change 
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne 
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X 
They were renegades of the atomic age 
So many renegades 

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
We are the force of another creation 
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen 
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance 
Like astrology 
Like technology 
Like God's Creation 
Like the Zulu station 
Like to the nation 
Like destroy all nations 
Like militants 
Like down in sand 
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same 
Oh renegades 

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy 
They change the course of history 
Everyday people like you and me 
You know they have their secret notions 
And time is endless motion 
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century 
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time 
A state of mind and a sense of pride 
A renegade, yes a renegade 
Of this time and age 
So many renegades 
Who's that 
Now hand clap 
The renegades 

We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
(Repeat) 

We're teachers of the funk 
And not of empty popping 
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of 
electronics 
With the bass, and the treble 
The horns and our vocals 
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man on the dance floor 
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force 
We're talking about Mr.B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E 
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age 
So many renegades 
What's that 
It's a hand clap

Say groove, sucker 
Say groove, sucker

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this now 

Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 
Renegades of this atomic age 
This atomic age for renegades 

Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
On down through the Middle Ages 
When the earth kept going through changes 
There's a business going on, cars continue to change 
Nothing stays the same, there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne 
Like Martin Luther King, Malcom X 
They were renegades of the atomic age 
So many renegades 

Hand clap, hand clap, the renegades 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
We are the force of another creation 
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical message to help the others listen 
Improve momentum and seek the electonic chance 
Like astrology 
Like technology 
Like God's Creation 
Like the Zulu station 
Like to the nation 
Like destroy all nations 
Like militants 
Like down in sand 
Like through changes ,nothing stays the same 
Oh renegades 

Now renegades are people with their own philosophy 
They change the course of history 
Everyday people like you and me 
You know they have their secret notions 
And time is endless motion 
All people of the moderate ages here in this twentieth century 
You have to keep up in time with the moderate time 
A state of mind and a sense of pride 
A renegade, yes a renegade 
Of this time and age 
So many renegades 
Who's that 
Now hand clap 
The renegades 

We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop 
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
(Repeat) 

We're teachers of the funk 
And not of empty popping 
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of 
electronics 
With the bass, and the treble 
The horns and our vocals 
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man on the dance floor 
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force 
We're talking about Mr.B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E 
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age 
So many renegades 
What's that 
It's a hand clap

Say groove, sucker 
Say groove, sucker 
Say dance, sucker

We're blessed with the Force and the sight of

With the bass, and the treble 
The horns and our vocals 
You know everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Bay Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down on the Bay sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man on the dance floor 
Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force 
We're talking about Mr.B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E 
Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age

Speak about destruction. (x3)
This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Countries are fighting with chemical warfare.
Not giving a damn about the people who live.
Nostradamus predicts the coming of the Antichrist.
Hey, look out, the third world nations are on the rise.
The Democratic-Communist Relationship,
Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force.
The CIA is looking for other detectives.
The KGB is smarter than you think.
Brainwash mentalities to control the system.
Using TV and movies - religions of course.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
Is it a nuclear war?
What are you asking for?
This is a world destruction. Your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
The rich get richer.
The poor are getting poorer.
Fascist, chauvinistic government fools.
People, Moslems, Christians and Hindus.
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth.
Who are you to think you're a superior race?
Facing forth your everlasting doom.
We are Time Zone. We've come to drop a bomb on you.

This is the world destruction, your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Nationalities are fighting with each other.
Why is this? Because the system tells you.
Putting people in faceless categories.
Knowledge isn't what it used to be.
Military tactics to control a nation.
Who wants to be a president or king? Me!
Mother Nature is gonna work against you.
Nothing in your power that you can do.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
You and I know it, the Bible tells you.
If we don't start to look for a better life,
The world will be destroyed in a time zone!

Tonight, I'm tryin' to make this real clear, dear
I've no time to whisper in your ear
No time to remove our fears
I just wanna get near
Get butt naked and roll around
Move our bodies like up and down
Do that stuff that your mama calls smut
Girl, Let's Get Butt Naked And Fuck!

Come on, you know you want to do it too
It's good to me, and it's good to you
I only speak what's true
You say you don't, but I know you do
Come on up to my room
We'll undress by the light of the moon
Lay down and I'll caress that butt

I know what you want, so you don't have to ask me

You're trying to rap but they give you frustration
Nose in the air, turnin' you down

Kickin' conversation, ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
When all that's really on your mind is what?

""Yo baby L.G.B.N.A.F.""
That's right if you're a man you want it
If you're a woman you tease him and flaunt it
But my crew got to have it
And after they dog it, I autograph it
The SYNDICATE don't lecture
We move in a group, seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
The girls will get butt naked and fuck that night

Afro Celt Sound System,"When I'm travelling far from home 
On the white horizon, 
I can feel you're still around, 
And the dream overtakes me. 

Then I know 
You'll stay in this moment 
We'll go where its flowing. 
You'll be what you want to be 

Right here with me. 
When I'm out here on my own, 
And it all cuts through me. 
I see you're safe alone, 

Oh then it hits me. 
And I know 
You're here in this moment, 
Right where its flowing. 

You are what you want to be 
Right here with me.

Afro Celt Sound System,"Everyday, you crawl into the night 
A fallen angel, with your wings set alight 
When you hit the ground 
Everything turns to blue 
I can't get through the smoke 
That's surrounding you 

'Cause when you're falling 
I can't tell which way is down 
And when you're screaming 
Somehow I don't hear a sound 
And when you're seeing things 
Then your feet don't touch the ground 
'Cause when you're falling 
I can't tell which way is down 

I can see through the clouds 
I can walk right through the walls 
Hang me off the ceiling 
But I can't take the fall 
Should I cross the river 
When I may get swept away 
Out there on the water 
You can still see me wave 

'Cause when you're falling 
I can't tell which way is down 
When you're falling 
I can't tell which way is down 
I can see all those things 
My feet don't touch the ground 

'Cause when you're falling 
I can't tell which way is down 
And when you're screaming 
Somehow I don't hear a sound 
And when you're seeing things 
Then your feet dont touch the ground

Afro Celt Sound System,"Crackin' walls inside my head
With a bottle full of rain
I promised to the coaster
I wouldn't tear it up again

Flick a peanut, break a glass
I wish I didn't sleep at Mass
And everything is closin' up
And yet again I come in last

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
And everything was blue
Everything was fine

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Rise above it, rise above it, rise above it

I see her on the ceiling
She's staring down in her gown
I had to make allowances
Between my love and goin' out

Now everything is closing up
The last call is well asleep
At gigs I danced with a Blue Nun
Now heartburn is goin' cheap

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
Everything was true
Everything sublime

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
You were always mine

Rise above, rise above it
I wouldn't tear it up again

Afro Cool Concept,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me

Afro-Blues Quintet + 1,"When I became of age my mother called me to her side,
She said,""Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride.

There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now.""

Oh yeah, you better shop around."" (shop, shop around)

Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando

El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido

Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

No lo ha podido el saber

Ni el más ancho pensamiento

De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros

Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto

Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes

Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17,2005

Die anderen Rapper fuckt das ab, habt ihr was? Dann kommt doch her
Aber bitte wer schafft es nur so ungefähr
So wie wir? Mikrofone brennen weil wir Funken spucken
Alter, wir sind nicht wie jeder machen's nicht mit jeder
Besitzen mehr Größenwahn als'n Ami, schwingt bei uns die Feder
Wie das größte Schwert Auf dem höchsten Pferd
Durch die Industrie kommen wir in Frieden wie Ganja oder Gandhi

Denn wenn wir hier sind seid ihr besser da
Und ihr wisst wer besser ist in diesem wie in jedem Jahr)
Vielleicht ist unser Rapstyle euch viel zu kompliziert
Das ist mir scheißegal, auch wenn ihr uns voll ignoriert
Ich lieb den Scheiß steh dahinter eintausend Prozent
Jeder der mich kennt, weiß ich bin der Rapper der wie Feuer brennt
Und das zeichnet einen guten MC aus
Er versteht sein Werk (und macht das beste draus)
Gar nichts fordert ihn heraus

Dafür sind andere MCs jetzt abgefuckt
Wie tight der Typ die Texte auf Takte packt
Das Ding dabei: Ich hab nicht mal nachgedacht
Sie nur nach ner durchgemachten Nacht aufs Blatt gebracht
Was geht ab? Dies hier ist extra für euch
Ihr wurdet von zu vielen Rappern in deutsch bitter enttäuscht
Zwar haben alle jetzt tolle teure Video-Clips
Aber ist das ein Ausgleich für alle die billigen Hits?

Hier kommt das Reime-Monster, gegen das ihr keine Chance habt
Wenn ihr mich nicht kennt, dann geht in'n Laden und checkt meine Songs ab
Und hört euch den MC an. Den Champion
Weil keiner am Mic kann, so wie's Samy kann. (Du kennst ihn, man)
Ich rap nicht für Sänger, Models und Schauspieler
Ich rap für Penner, Volltrottel und Hauptschüler
Rap nicht für Celebrities aus der High Society
Ich bin ein rude boy, piss an dein Polizeirevier
Krieg sogar Props von Häftlingen, das ich def kling
Und der Chef bin in diesem verbalen Wrestling
Und deswegen mach' ich am Mic so auf Dicken
Denn die Jungs komm'n bald raus, und ich hab sie im Rücken
Spaß beiseite, dies ist bitterer Ernst
In Sachen Rap könnt ihr noch von Euren Müttern was lernen
Ich übernehm Bühnen, bring Typen ab vom MCn
Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun, wie James Dean

Mein Mann Afrob macht den Hook, du fragst: Wie geht denn das?
Ganz einfach, Mann. Die echten Styler halten zusammen

let's go, let's go!

Alle wollen den Rapper sehen
Rapper kommen, Rapper gehen
Entertain, Rapper Fame
Netter Song, fett im Game
Beat droppt, mach ihn laut
Rap' auf, pack es aus, achtet auf
Den Afrokamm, kämm die Matte aus
Power look, power Hook
Angespannt, Dauerdruck
Aufgebaut, aufgesaugt
Eingekauft, ausgespuckt
Yeah, pump diese, diese
Pump, pump fiese Beats
Rick Marvel macht es und ich Hip Hop Musik
Sechser in Mathe, aber nie in der Lotterie
Hart auf der Bühne bis man die Schweißtropfen sieht
BRD, Übersee, überall überlebt
Ich steh' im Schatten, deshalb bin ich leicht zu übersehen
Ich tret' ins Licht, um das Mikrofon zu übernehmen
Der Rest lehnt ab, ich bin grad zu unbequem
So echt, so fresh, so back, so Rap, so ?

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Ich liebe diesen Rap Shit, so sieht das aus
Oh ja klar, oh ja klar! (Was geht ab?)

Es ist wieder Zeit und ich schließe den Kreis
Hip Hop braucht mich mehr denn je, ohne Scheiß
Solange ich das Gras Rauch und nicht in das beiß'
Roll' ich mit Hip Hop, ihr wisst ab jetzt Bescheid
Hatte reichliche Fehler für peinliche Hater
Doch jeder der mich fühlt, ist ein heimlicher Neger
Es gibt kein Lager für mich
Aller, ja ja, bla bla, laber
Ich hab diese Nummer drauf, so wie kein Zweiter
Es ist dieser Eifer nach Beifall und Neidern
Im Backstage die Cypher, es geht immer weiter
Mir fällt immer etwas neues ein wie MacGyver
Echt mal, echt mal
Egal Lan, wie lang ich weg war
Hab Hunger, Kannibal wie Hannibal Lecter
Test' und fress' diese sogenannten Rapstars
Als Rentner im Rollstuhl, mit Pampers

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf

Denn es geht immer weiter

Ich liebe diesen Rap Shit, so sieht das aus
Oh ja klar, oh ja klar! (Was geht ab?)

Ich bin ein Rap-Vet-Veteran
Mach den Track fett du hast mich verpasst
So wie die letzte Bahn
Der Elefant im Raum
Bin elegant zum Sound, bin penetrant, redgewandt
Ich habe einen Traum, raus aus der Matrix
Fernsehfanatisch
Bringe euch den Frühling (let's go)
Auf Arabisch
Merhaba, Selamat
Der Boss ist da
Egal, welcher Wochentag
Ich bin hart im nehmen, ich bin klar zu sehen
Guck' mich genau an, ich bin ein Problem
Geh mir aus dem Weg, ich mach keine Gefangenen
Ich kill' sie alle, wie ein nach dem anderen

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

Es hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Hört nie auf, hört nie auf
Denn es geht immer weiter

„Eines hab ich gelernt, das in ´ner Beziehung immer
Jeder seine eigene Wahrheit hat
Is auch vollkommen okay so
Das schwierige daran is nur, zu wissen wann Schluss ist
Das muss man immer wissen wann Schluss ist
(yeah, check this)

Als ich dich das erste Mal sah, war ich wie verzaubert
So wie jeder Mann, Augenaufschlag, Let´s Go!
Ich dachte ich wär am Ende meiner Suche
Gute Frau, gutes Haus, selbständig, gute Schule
Es war Liebe auf den zweiten Blick
Eigentlich könnte das schon Fail sein, ich weiß es nicht, wer weiß es?
Wer will schon den Partner seines Lebens spät treffen?
Man setzt sich unter Druck, ist vom Gedanken besessen
(Ey)
Die Zeit rennt, und du hinterher
Der Spagat zwischen Frei sein und Beziehungen ist immer schwer
Wie dem auch sei
Das Wasser ist geweiht
Der Priester steht bereit
Und die Braut kommt in weis
So wär´s gekommen, ich hätte dich fast gefragt
Heute sind wir beide froh, denn es kam nie der Tag
Ich hatte
Viel für sie übrig
Die Freunde war´n von Anfang an gegen mich, wie üblich
Denn
Der Afrob-Faktor ist Fluch und auch Segen
Sie tat sich damit schwer, und konnte nie damit leben
Zweifel kommen früh, doch die Einsicht sehr spät
Besser als nie, jeder geht seinen Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg

Manchmal gehört etwas einfach nicht zusammen
Du kannst es kleben, nageln, schweißen, auch ein Kind
ändert nichts daran
Hast du schon wieder in mein Handy geguckt
Mit wem ich skype, twitter oder app auf facebook?
Man verliert sich im Kleinen
Bei den großen Sachen waren wir miteinander im Reinen
Komm
Frisch aus dem Knast, ich verließ meine Stadt
Albträume in der Nacht, Kopfkissen immer nass
Was, das zwischenmenschliche mal hilft
Wenn es einem nicht gut geht
Das heißt noch nicht das man als Partner alles durchsteht
Man trennt sich und kommt wieder zusammen
Um sich, wieder zu trennen
Um dann
Wieder zusammen zu kommen
Was für ein Schwachsinn, on und off wie 18
Stürz mich ins Nachtleben, muss was von meinem Saft geben
Geben, geben, geben, geben, geben
Besser als nie, jeder geht sein Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg
Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein, seinen Weg seinen Weg seinen Weg seinen Weg
Jeder geht seinen Weg seinen Weg

Hoffnung ist ein schlechter Ratgeber
Ich war Opfer, war Täter
Wurd´ schwach, war sch…
Es vergeht kein Feiertag ohne Streit, geh ich weg oder bleib ich?
Was kommt bloß danach, man? Ich weiß nicht
Es kann immer schlimmer kommen
Ich suche Gründe für die Zukunft in guten Erinnerungen
Ich tapp im Dunkeln
Topfschlagen hasste ich als Kind
Denn ich hab das scheiss Ding nie gefunden
Mein Herz aus Stein, und ich wein nicht, nicht mal heimlich
Man redet es sich schön, nur wenn man allein ist, yeah..
Besser als nie, jeder geht sein Weg

Ich geh mein Weg
Geh mein Weg
Jeder geht sein
Seinen Weg
Ich geh mein Weg

Afrob,"Sie gaben mir einen Namen, ich trug ihn lang mit Stolz
Ich ging den harten Weg, die Anderen dann Gold
Viele meinen rappen sei ein Zuckerschlecken
Morddrohungen, Haters, MCs, nicht gleich über Mutter sprechen
Es gibt viele aus dem Game, die in der Klapse sind
Man ist unzufrieden, obwohl die Kasse stimmt
Ich hass den roten Teppich, geh ungern auf den Echo
Alles Borgs, voll auf Koks, Widerstand ist zwecklos
Immer mehr sehn die Radieschen von unten
Es ist der Krebs, er hat seine Kunden gefunden
Spar dir den Spaten, um Afrob zu begraben
Ich bin euch etwas schuldig und zahle in Raten
Kokain ist sehr, sehr gefährlich
Es ist ein geiler Turn, jetzt ma ehrlich
Und deshalb wirst du es auch immer wieder tun
Einmal Kokser, immer Kokser, es lässt dich nie in Ruh

Beim Schreiben führt der Teufel neulich meine Hand
Ich komm nicht in das Paradies

Gottverdammt, es ist Haram
Als wenn ich auf einen Pfarrer schieß
Einige hätten es so verdient
Bei Ritualen kleine Kindern die Roben überziehen
Frag die Grünen, denn alle Teenager sind voll auf Linie
Glauben an CO2 und hassen Familie
Ich tu mir nie einen Gefallen mit dem was ich sag
Der Verfassungsschutz, ein Mittel wegen Letzter seiner Art
Ich glaub an keine Theorie, ich glaub an die Verschwörung
Der Königsmacher ist der King, auch ohne Krönung
Ich brauch die letzte Ölung, vor der Versöhnung
In letzter Zeit träum ich sehr oft von meiner Tötung
Ein dünner Wichser der sich jetzt mit Rap zu Helfen weiß
Rap hat mich gerettet, mich erzogen, mir die Welt gezeigt

An die Medien, an die Politik, den ganzen Apparat
Wah! Es sind Barbaren am Werk

Keiner sagte mir, dass ich der Bank gehör - Fick dich!
Keiner sagte mir, dass sie das Land zerstörn

Alter ist relativ, manche werden früh erwachsen
Und manche hatten nie die Chance, ein Kind zu sein
Ob Plattenbau, Großstadtvilla oder Kinderheim
Wie fühlt es sich jetzt an, noch manchmal Kind zu sein

Ich spreitz' die Flügel, ich will fliegen, so wie Peter Pan
Doch wo ist die Balance zwischen Vernunft und dem Jugendwahn
Und wieso fühl' ich mich bei Mutter wie ein Kind
Vielleicht weil ich es für sie auch immer bin

Kinder über dreißig schmieden das Eisen
Solange es noch heiß ist, oh
Sind wir denn jetzt schon erwachsen? Ich weiß nicht, ich weiß nicht
Hoffentlich werden wir's merken, wenn's soweit ist

Was ist schon erwachsen, nicht mehr rauchen, nicht mehr saufen
Nicht mehr kiffen, nicht mehr schlauchen, nicht mehr glauben, sondern wißen
Geht man nicht mehr sooft raus, liegt man lieber auf der Couch
Bekommt man ein' dicken Bauch, hat man eine feste Frau

Hat man keinen Spaß mehr oder nur noch Sex nach Plan
Ist man zu sehr abgeklärt und viel weniger spontan
Ich jogge in der Innenstadt und zahle pünktlich meine Rechnungen, zieh' die Gardine zu um Mitternacht

Tipp mich nicht an, das macht aggressiv
Bitte halt' dich fern

Verballern viele, damit diese Penner nicht mehr stören

Ich geb' einen Fick und lache sie an
Ich lache sie aus

Komm sabber mich voll
Guck mit welcher Mama ich roll
Überlebe mit der Melodie
So wie Michael Myers Halloween

Alle meine Narben
All die Namen, die sie mir mal gaben
In diesen Tagen, was hast du gesagt?
Ich hätte doch so gerne zugeschlagen
Ich sagte mir, ich muss mein Inneres nach außen tragen
Trotzdem mache ich noch sehr oft zu viele Fehler
Manchmal hohe Berge, doch öfters tiefe Täler
Ich such die tiefsten auf, nicht nur weil ich Wiesen rauch'
Sondern weil ich diesen brauch, Flash
Und wir schießen drauf
Nimm' ein Magazin und dann eine Kugel
Das dann im Rudel, ein Sieg doch kein Jubel
Dunkel und so kalt die Nächte, böse Mächte
Scheiß auf meine Pflichten, denn ich habe keine Rechte
Vergiss die Bullen, Alter, Mann die helfen dir nicht weiter
Warum soll ich noch schweigen, heute nenn' ich Ross und Reiter
Hab die ganze Welt verflucht, hatte es zu oft versucht
Machte mehr als einen Schritt, auf meinen Gegenüberzug
Der Afroasiate, Alter, was da alles wiederkam
War der Stoff, den ich für meine Lieder nahm
Ich bin keiner von euch und ich werd' das niemals sein
Ich möchte auch nicht mehr, lieber sterbe ich allein und sag

Komm zu dem Wind, ich will 'ne Jungfrau zu dem Kind
Warte auf den Sturm bis er kommt und mich dann nimmt
Kam schon sehr viel raus und da ist noch viel mehr drin
Manche Leute machen um mich einfach zu viel Wind, und sagen
Komm zu dem Wind, ich will 'ne Jungfrau zu dem Kind
Warte auf den Sturm bis er kommt und mich dann nimmt
Ich hatte keine Ahnung, denn ich wusste, dass es stimmt
Alles ist so wahr, wer's nicht sah, ist voll blind

Seitdem ich denken kann, leb ich in nem' fremden Land
Das ist nicht meine Heimat und kein Ort an dem ich Frieden fand
Man sucht vergeblich eine Antwort wer man ?
Deshalb red' ich, schreib' den Brief und ihr versteht nicht
Die Regierenden, in der Wirtschaft führenden
Nicht ?, nicht zu schweigen, ich bin einer mit 'ner blühenden
Nennt es wie ihr wollt, ich weiß ihr seid unantastbar
Wie kann man so was sagen, weil der Kohl noch nicht im Knast war
Könnt es nicht verhindern, meine Wirkung nicht mehr mindern
Ihr könnt es nicht verschweigen, ich erzähl es euern Kindern
Keine Gute Nacht Geschichte, von einem Gleichaltrigen
Der nach'm Anschlag niemals mehr das Licht der Welt erblickte
Mich niemals aufgebe, ständig such ich Auswege
Hielt da oben alles was ihr sagt, wie 'ne Ausrede
Entfache keinen Krieg in mir, das Opfer wär zu schade
Wie viel Opfer warn der Sache wert, nach einer Niederlage?
Immer sterben meine Leute auf den deutschen Straßen
Wir sind unerwünscht, so wie in 'nem Körper Metastasen
Wie lange ich das durchgeh', bevor ich durchdreh'
Therapier mich selbst, mit vielen Augen feucht sehen

Watch me, watch me, ueaj

Vergieße keine Träne, ich fixiere die Probleme
Es gibt auch nichts zu weinen, nicht weil ich mich dafür schäme
Sondern weil es keine Rolle spielt, os oft ich es erwähne
Keiner hört hier diesen Schrei in der deutschen Hip-Hop Szene
Eines wurd' mir klar, denn ich stieße in Gefahr
Und ich hab keine Comunnity, wen juckt es was ich sag?
Also, beschränk ich mich, auf die Wenigen da draußen
Betroffene, Erschrockene, ich mein den ganzen Haufen
Doch immer mehr verstehen und täglich steigt ihre Zahl
Alter, was soll ich denn tun?
Mach ein Kreuz bei jeder Wahl
Alles zu seiner Zeit, seid ihr sicher, dass es wird?
Glaubt man uns als 'ne Einheit, oder eine, die es wird

Afrob,"„Meli, mein Schatz, du hast alles richtig gemacht
Hast mir kein Wort geglaubt
Das war das Beste, was du tun konntest
Let's go“

Halb eins, Stuttgart Mitte, es ist Samstag Nacht
Ich hab' 'n Babe mit mir, Mädchen aus der Nachbarschaft
Sie fand die Action geil, überall der Eintritt frei
Die Diva von der ersten Liga hatte auch ihren Shiva dabei
Wir rockten fett ab in jedem Club der Innenstadt
Jeder fragte: „Wer ist die da, 'ne Schlampe, wie sie jeder hat?“
Auf keinen Fall, schau' sie dir doch an und dann
Erzähl' mir, dass sie keine Lady ist, sie lässt nicht jeden ran
Das Gelalle von den Leuten ging mir auf die Eier
Es war kein Spaß, den wir hatten
Auf zur nächsten Feier
Noch 'n Tankstellenstop, brauchte Papers und noch mehr
Kaufte uns zwei Piccolos, das gefiel ihr sehr
Fanden uns bei ihr wieder, Zeit für einen riesen Weeder
Setz' dich nieder, der Plattenspieler spielte nur noch sanfte Lieder
Ich war zu schüchtern, vielleicht zu nüchtern, weil ich sie mag
Sie schlief ein, ich ging heim, Baby, schöner Tag

Ich wollt', es wär' so einfach
Doch ich weiß, dass ich dich nicht für mich allein hab'
Siehst du Himmel, lügst du Blaues, ich kann dir nicht trauen
Tausend Phrasen, tausend Frauen, was soll ich dir glauben?

Schaue in den den Spiegel, ey, mein neuer Pulli steht dir gut
Damit geh' ich raus, wie man das mit neuen Sachen tut
Chille in der Nachbarschaft, ich treff' sie wieder
Die Diva mit dem vielen Shiva, damals aus der geilen Nacht
Nervös im Kopf, feucht die Hände, Haare heute blonde
Schwarzes Top, Minirock
Mann, sie war die Bombe!
Ich merkte, sie gefällt mir sehr, dachte
Mann, da geht noch mehr
„Vielleicht ruf' ich dich an, sagte sie“
Das war schon lange her
Mein Phone schwieg, blieb still, hängte ab, Lauryn Hill
Und wenn es klingelte, dann war sie's wieder nicht
Ey Mann, ich chill'
Mach' mich locker, leb' mein Leben weiter
Gott sei Dank! Ich kenn' so viele Typen, ey, die machte sowas krank
Für sie brauchst du Energie, Mann, ich geb' ihr mehr als das
Schreib' ihr tausend schöne Lieder, alle ohne Beat und Bass
Ich lag daheim im Bett, es traf mich wie 'n Brett, dachte: Nett!
Gesteh' ich meine Liebe oder lauf' ich weiter von ihr weg?

Ich wollt', es wär' so einfach
Doch ich weiß, dass ich dich nicht für mich allein hab'
Siehst du Himmel, lügst du Blaues, ich kann dir nicht trauen
Tausend Phrasen, tausend Frauen, was soll ich dir glauben?

Afrob,"Relaxe, Typ, lehn' dich endlich zurück
Zu dem neuen Sound von Afrob und Samy Deluxe
Vergiss schnell den Alltag, schalt' das Telefon aus
Weil du hier all diese Leute und ihr Gerede nicht brauchst
Jeder versucht dir Deine Zeit zu rauben
Fernsehen will uns dazu bringen jeden Scheiß zu glauben
Scheinbar ist die Lösung für Probleme einzukaufen
Irgendwelche neuen Produkte, die wir meist nicht brauchen
Aber Hauptsache ist, du denkst nicht nach über dich
Und über's Leben an sich, darüber redet man nicht
Man wartet lieber einfach ab, was für Befehle man kriegt
Vom bösen Mann mit dem kleinen Bart, mir geht es gegen den Strich
Ständig neue Schreckensmeldungen: Massenmorde und Krieg!
Zum Ablenken gibt es Filme, Sex, Sport und Musik
Doch man hat niemals echte Ruhe, Zeit zum entspannen
Deshalb hör' zu, relax' mit uns beiden zusammen!

Hey du, nimm dir kurz Zeit und hör' mal zu!

Ich wach' auf, ganz normal, und geh' meinen Job nach
Schau' auf das Papier, das ich nachts in den Korb warf
Leg' auf dicke Beats meinen Text, denn der muss wirken
Wirk', wirk', Zauberspruch, hilf mir bei den Hürden
Ich dank' bei meinem Team für Unterstützung bis zum letzten
Hatten alle Strophen drauf und waren laut am texten
Ich hatte nie die Ambition Rapper Nummer Eins zu sein
Ich wollt' ein Eigenheim, mit Made in Germany ein Meilenstein
Bin befreit von all dem Stress oder Druck
Ich mach' Musik, nur weil ich will, nicht weil ich muss
Ich bin zu bodenständig, deshalb fürchte ich den Flieger
Gehör' nicht in die Luft, Alter, ich chill' lieber
Mit den Jungs, Beats aus den Autos
Wir sehen die Leute auf der Straße laufen
Check' das aus, dieses Mixtape zum besten
Wir teilen uns die Verse, das kann nichts ersetzen

Es gibt nur eins, was wirklich hilft, wenn all die Scheiße mich stresst
Das ist Musik extrem laut, Nachbarn, haltet Euch fest
Ich dreh' den Sound auf und space ab wie Astronaut
Dreh' gern den Bass zu laut, bin fast schon taub
Ey yo, pass mal auf, gute Musik ist wie 'n Heilmittel
Versetzt mich zurück in die alten Zeiten nach Eimsbüttel
An den Gänsemarkt, an den Jungfernstieg
Wisst ihr noch, wie's damals war, spürt Ihr den Unterschied?

Der Beat ist Hypnose, ich denke oft an die Kolchose
Das war frisch, nicht aus der Dose
Stuttgart Neunzehnhundertdreiundneunzig
Das Level war gehoben und die Ziele war 'n eindeutig
Atme tief durch, mochte diese Zeit
Doch wo ich herkomm' ist jetzt nicht mehr, wo ich bleib'
Wunder gibt es jeden Tag, ich seh's mit eigenen Augen
Das Gute kann mir keiner nehmen oder rauben!

Marie angraben ohne Rücksicht auf 'n Nachbeben
Nightrider, exzessiv, Hasselhoff
Tassen hoch, masel tov
Denn wenn wir kommen dann geht was
Er und ich, Freeman und De Niro in Las Vegas
Die alte Schule in der Diskothek
Die alten Tricks auspacken, sehen ob das noch geht
Die alten Hits hören und laut dazu rappen
Die alten Knochen können nix mehr außer two steppen
Zwei nach rechts und zwei nach links
Eine Hand an ihrer Hüfte, eine Hand am Drink
Aber bitte Mädels nicht so ran schmeißen

Ey yo, der Himmel färbt sich grau, wenn ich nach oben schau
Es wird gleich regnen, ja genau
Komisch, vorhin war er doch noch baby-blau
Riech' den Pflaster, meine Nachbarn ihre Pasta
Schau' dem Regen zu und rauch' 'n bisschen von meinem Laster
Jetzt hab' ich crazy visions, setz' mich hin und schreibe was
Nur auf 'm Beat und Bass

Sitzt zu Hause, wählt die Reps und sagt auch immer „Scheiß Kanacke“

In der Schule rennen sie rum und stressen jeden, der nicht Deutscher ist
Wussten nicht, von was sie reden, ich hielt die Faust dagegen
Es half kein Diskutieren, Mann, ich wollt' auch nicht mehr

Am gleichen Platz, rauchten Gras
Glaub mir das, wenn ich's dir sag!
Hatten nichts zu tun, arbeitslos
Denn ihre Sorgen um die Zukunft waren noch nie besonders groß
Immer nur das Gleiche, Langeweile bringt dich um, macht dich zur Leiche
Ihr Viertel war bekannt für Arme, nicht für Reiche
Hatten Träume so wie ihr, ey, wie alle
Auf die Schule hatten sie keinen Bock, bla bla, zu viel Gelalle
Also kein Abi, kein Franz
„Common ça va ma belle?“
Viele wurden kriminell, von heut' auf morgen, es ging so schnell
Jugendhaus war kein Thema, die scheiß Pädagogen wussten nicht wovon sie reden
Alter, ungelogen!
Viele kommen klar, gutes Elternhaus
Ah ja! Dem geht das Geld nie aus, wie wahr!
In der Clique sind sie auch der Star
Ich traf Menschen, Typen, Leute, Charaktere
Wüsste nicht, wo ich ohne sie heute wäre
Ich kannte einen, der war ein krasser
Im Gesicht ein blasser, früher meint er nur: „LSD ins Trinkwasser“
Ich vermutete, dass er stark blutete, tief in sich
Hilfe gab es nicht, nur immer Ärger, doch er wehrte sich
Wie konnt' es anders sein? Armes Schwein, so allein
Seine Eltern machten Druck und drohten immer mit dem Heim
Dann war es mal so weit, irgendwann mal gab es Streit
Zu Hause flogen voll die Fetzen, denn sein Vater war es leid
Siehst du, was die Menge treibt? Hörst du, was die Menge schreit?
Unberechenbar durch ihre Unzufriedenheit
Als ich sagte: „Babylon ist, wo ich wohn'“
Meint' ich die Verlogenheit der Verfallskorruption

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Alles nehm' ich mit

Ich wein wie ein Mann, brauch mich dafür nicht zu schämen
Jeder sucht sein Glück, mancher findet es sofort
Noch immer kein Fuß in Berlin, der falsche Ort
Ich laufe rückwärts gewagt
Deshalb seh ich nie was vor mir liegt und der Zustand hält an
Man hat die Wahl zwischen resignieren und abtreten
Ich hab die Wahl zwischen fokussieren und maßnehmen
Ich rück' mein' Kragen zurecht, wie Phönix aus der Asche

Für das Eigenheim

Sogar der deutsche Fußball wird, auch der wird nicht mehr respektiert
Es findet sich auch kein Bundestrainer für den armen Haufen hier
Das alles passt zu meiner Stimmung, wenn ich an mein' Briefkasten geh'
Wenn ich in mein' Briefkasten seh'
Da stapeln sich die Rechnungen, Strom, Telefon
Und ich habe  klar 'n Handy, scheiß Tarif bei Vodafone
Für das Fernseh-Glotzen, wart' mal, zahl' ich GEZ und Kabel
Benzin ist mir zu teuer, ich mach' jetzt einen auf Erik Zabel
Miete, Haftpflicht-, Kranken-, Kfz-Versicherung
Wenn ich mal 'was trinken geh' erfolgt sehr schnell Ernüchterung
Hab' DSL zum Ziel, weil ich mir CDs nicht leisten kann
An Urlaub ist noch nicht zu denken, fang' erst nicht das Reisen an
Mein Arbeitgeber streicht die Weihnachtsgelder, bange um mein' Job
Aktionäre wollen Entlassungen, die Firma sei bankrott
Zum Glück leb' ich alleine, es reicht ja vorne und auch hinten nicht
Manche wollen's nicht sehen, denen schick' ich es in Blindenschrift

Afrob,"Ich hörte schon im Kindergarten, Leute zu mir Nigga sagen
Grad wenn man für etwas steht, erfährt man sehr oft Niederlagen
Wollte nie 'n Prediger sein, eher 'n Aufklärer
Wollte mich nicht boxen, ich war eher so der Lautsprecher
Wuchs auf, fremd im eigenen Land, kein Ausländer
Schrieb drinnen Texte, hoffte, dass sich was da draußen ändert
Aber die Texte werden jährlich aktueller
Ich will, dass mich Leute hören, deshalb rap ich Acapella, wuh
Schwarzer Panter wie T'Challa in Wakanda, Brothers Keepers
Scheint wir kriegen keinen Obama, ich will Torch als Bundeskanzler
Und fick H&M, Handelsembargo, Frieden für alle Farben
Ein Remix für Adriano

Yeah, woo, jau, woo

Das geht eins, zwei, drei, let's go

Jetzt ist die Zeit, hier ist der Ort
Hier, heute ist die Nacht, Torchmann hat das Wort
Denk' ich an Deutschland in der Nacht
Bin ich um meinen Schlaf gebracht
Mein Bruder Adriano wurde umgebracht
Hautfarbe, schwarz, Blut, rot, Schweigen ist Gold
Gedanken sind tiefblau
Ein Bürger hat Angst vor seinem Volk
Ein Wintermärchen aus Deutschland, blauer Samt
Als Kind schon erkannt, hier bin ich fremd im eigenen Land
Operation Artikel 3, da habt ihr gelacht
Jungs, das ist mein Leben, das ha'm wir uns nicht ausgedacht
In all den Jahren in denen wir Airplay verschwendet haben
Man könnte denken, wir Rapper hätten nichts zu sagen
Doch es rächt sich, ihr werdet sehen, es holt uns ein
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein (oh, oh)
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (yeah)
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende
Was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Ich rapp' für meinen Bruder, denn ich könnte auch das Opfer sein
Falscher Ort, falsche Zeit, da hilft dir auch nicht tapfer sein
Wie viel Blut muss fließen in innerdeutschen Krisen
Alter, schau die letzen Jahre haben das mir zu oft bewiesen
Dass die Menschen sich erheben, wenn die Leute nicht mehr leben
Doch dann ist es zu spät, ihr solltet öfters drüber reden
Also, wie ist das möglich? Manchmal ist es doch tödlich
Gerechtigkeit, denn nicht nur Adriano hat es nötig

Zu viele Promis machen politische Promo-Gigs
Ich hoff' der Track hier ist 'n Dildo, der die Zone fickt
Ich will nix mehr erzählen zum Nationalbefreien
Ich sage K, sage Z, sage Nazis rein
Ich will nicht labern, denn ich kenn' mein Vaterland
Macht es mich krank wie Masern, dann verspür ich Tatendrang
Ich fühle mich eingeengt und will statt Prominenz
Und statt großer Fans, Nazis, die wie Poster hängen

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung (woo)
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung (ja, Mann)
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt (ah)
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (yeah)
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende
Und was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände (ah)
Euer Niedergang für immer
Und was wir hören werden, ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Zuviel ungereimte Scheiße, nicht genug Protest
Rechter Terror wird verharmlost so wie Schulhofstress
Trotz Beweisen, Wahrheitsfindung bleibt ein Suchprozess
Keine Gerechtigkeit beim NSU-Prozess
Zu viele, die immer wieder weggesehen haben
Keiner redet hier gerne von echten Fehlern
Rechte Politik gefällt den rechten Wählern
Rechte Polizisten helfen rechten Tätern
Rechte Zellen in unserm Heer kommen nicht von ungefähr
Wehrmachtsveteranen starteten die Bundeswehr
Für viele ist das nur Geschichte und nicht mehr
Die alten Geschichten interessieren die Jungen nicht mehr
Sie sagen, „Reg dich ab, lass es hinter dir“
Aber wenn der Fremdenhass nicht endet, was beginnt dann hier?
Und wie erzieh ich mein Kind dann hier?
Asylantenheime brennen noch immer hier, was

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung
Wir fallen dort ein, wo ihr auffallt
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich Aufhalt (okay)

Und was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände
Euer Niedergang für immer

Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

Ich sag, woo
Sie nennen uns Mimimis
Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Leute fragen mich, woher ich komm'
Ich sage, ich komme aus Hamburg City
Sie sagen: „Ne, du weißt schon, was ich meine!“
Dabei war die Antwort richtig
Sie sagen, ich spreche ja toll deutsch
Fragen mich, wo hab' ich das so gut gelernt
Ich muss runterkomm', ich schwör', ich roll' 'n Joint
Und, und höre auf, den Menschen zuzuhören
Ich schwör', genauso wie es damals war
Ist es noch immer in der Gegenwart, eh
Ich kenn' das seit mei'm ersten Lebensjahr
Die Leute wollen's nicht einsehen, doch ich leb' hier schon mein Leben lang
Und wenn ich mecker' über dieses Land
Sagen sie: „Geh doch hin woher du kommst!“
Okay, dann geh' ich halt nach Eppendorf
Ich hab' auch angefangen mit Rappen dort
Aber das ist nicht, was du meintest, ne
Du willst, dass ich in meine Heimat geh'
Ich schwör', dies' Land hier ist so ignorant
Was? Wahrscheinlich bricht es bald 'n Weltrekord
Ich hab' hier niemandem 'n Job geklaut
Yeah, ich hab' hier vielen Leuten Jobs gegeben
Guck ma, dies hier geht raus an meine Mimimis
Sie mögen es nicht, wenn wir offen reden
Halb deutsch, halb Ausländer
Es heißt, ich führe ein Doppelleben
Und ich schaue hoch in Himmel, um zu Gott zu beten
Sag mal, kennt ihr auch ein paar Mimimis?
Mimimis, Mimimis, „Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

„Und jetzt der nächste Mimimi
Hier live und direkt
Illegal immigriert aus Ostafrika
Mein Mann Afrob“

Yeah, ey ey, Alter, was diese „Mimimi""?
Ich bin Intensivtäter, German Dream
Das ist Afrob made in Germany
Das Boot ist voll, Deutschland, Hysterie
Huh, sie nennen mich „Public Enemy“ (Enemy)
Im Fadenkreuz der AFD (AFD)
Sie sagen, ich wär primitiv (was?)
Lügenpresse ARD, ja, Leute, das ist Hassliebe
Ich hab keine Zeit, Mann, ich hab Krise
Ich mach Plus und ich mach Miese
Arbeite an Maschinen, bevor sie mich abschieben
Leute machen falschen Vergleich (Vergleich)
Es geht nicht um schwarz oder weiß (oh, nein)
Es geht um arm oder reich
Und wer das nicht begreift, ja, na dann tut's mir leid
Alter, was diese „Mimimi“?
Liegestuhl, Kampf am Strandbad von Rimini?
Kein Problem, da mach ich auch mit, ich bitte Sie
Gern billige Arbeitskraft für die Industrie
Ah, ich kenne alle deutschen Kaiser
Peter, Alexander und noch Hans Meiser
Sing das Lied der Deutschen, doch nicht alle drei Strophen
Eine ist erlaubt und die zwei sind verboten
Ich bin ein Immigrant, ein Gigant, Asylant
Braungebrannt, für dich bin ich sogar militant
„Oh mein Gott, die Kanaken nehmen überhand“
Jetzt ist sie weg, diese übergroße Toleranz
Die BRD wird überrant
Brauchen jetzt den nationalen Widerstand
Der Untergang des Abendlands, Lage ist sehr angespannt
So brisant, keine Angst, denn ich bin doch nur ein

Mimimi, Mimimi, Mimimi
„Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund“

„Yo! Und der nächste Mimimi
Macht einmal Applaus
Für meinen Mann MoTrip
Aus'm Libanon hierher gekommen“

Ah, eine Frage: bin ich wirklich deutsch
Oder gebe ich mich nur als Deutscher aus?
Umm, was soll ich sagen, Mann, ich fühl mich deutsch, yeah
Doch ich seh nicht wie ein Deutscher aus
Und jeder denkt, er wüsste, wer du bist
Terrorist, davon gehen die Deutschen aus
Okay, nicht alle, doch ich kenn mich mit Deutschen aus
Seit neustem grenzen mich die Deutschen aus
Geh und sag den Deutschen, Ausländer sind nur Menschen
Auf der Flucht, deshalb rennen wir über Grenzen
Ich hab dazu gelernt, ich kenn' die Konsequenzen
Doch ich putze keine Schuhe mehr, ich kämpfe, um zu glänzen
Sie reden ständig nur von Ängsten
Lenken, was du denkst auf allen Sendern und Frequenzen
Und auch wenn wir uns am Ende doch ergänzen
Denken sich die Menschen
Lass mal mit den fremden Kontinenten
Wo soll das enden? Shit, ich glaub, dass es aus ist (aus ist)
So mancher hier verfault, bis er braun ist (braun ist)
Auf der Vergangenheit 'ne faustdicke Staubschicht
Ein ganz schmaler Grad zwischen Klausnitz und Auschwitz
Und diese Ghettos haben wir selbst gemacht
Viele Kinder wachsen auf ohne Aussicht (ja)
Ja, ich weiß, wir leben beide in der selben Stadt
Doch ich spüre dein Vertrauen überhaupt nicht
Und geh ich raus, gibt's Probleme mit den Rechten
Und vor Gericht dann Probleme mit den Rechten
Wenn du das mit Menschen machst
Dann endet das im Fremdenhass
Und heutzutage nenn' wir das Probleme, die sich rächten
Halb Mensch, halb Mimimi, yeah
Kein Killer, wie man ihn im Krimi sieht
Wir sind clean, doch sehen aus wie auf Tilidin
Mein Lieblingslied ist bis heute „Billie Jean“, ja, ich bin ein

Hier heut' Abend sehen?
Ihr müsst noch 'n bisschen warten

Yeah, ich sag dies' der Re-mi-mi-mix
Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Remix, viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Die Menschlichkeit ist ein Minimum
Sie schalten unsre Stimmen stumm
Sie nannten uns als Kinder dumm
Wir waren wie DJ Khaled, sie wollen nicht, dass wir gewinnen
Und schauten uns mit Mitleid an, als wär' es 'ne Behinderung
Hoo, heute rulen Mimimis
Boateng hängt mit Jigga rum
Gäb es hier keine Mimimis, huh
Dann gäb es hier auch keine Entwicklung, Statement
Robert kam damals aus Afrika, ah
So wie auch viele andere Habescha
Heut ist er ein nationaler Star
Und gewinnt Awards in Kanada, Gratulation
Uh, ich bin stoned, Mann, wo waren wir grad?
Ohladidadida, so viele Nazis da, so krasse Party grad
Lass mich diesen Beat hier killen
Eko hat 'ne Serie und einen eigenen Kinofilm
Nicht schlecht für'n Quotentürken, lass den Flow hier wirken
Dies geht an alle Mimimis in allen Wohnbezirken
Trip kam aus Libanon, nahm ein Mikrofon
Heute hat er viel Erfolg, Mimimis kriegen Gold, woo
„Hey, mach mal'n Song gegen Nazis, Sam“
Warum? Ich versteh das nicht
Ich hab noch nie was gegen die gehabt (sag es)
Die hatten immer etwas gegen mich
Lasst uns Fremden doch die Hand geben, yo

Und ohne viel Kollateralschäden
Hier in Frieden in diesem Land leben, alle meine

Ich bin der Vorzeige Kanake (Kanake)
Aber kann besser als viele deutsch (viele deutsch)
Jeder Türke klopft mir auf die Schulter (klopf klopf!)
Aber keiner, der sich Freezy käuft
Bisschen Fremdenhass liegt in der Luft
Gruß geht an die Pegida (Hoo Hoo)
Ich geh Samstagabend in den Puff (und?)
Und frage: „Ist die Peggi da?“
Manche machen einen auf korrekt
Dann nimm doch einen Flüchtling auf
Ich bin kein strenger Musilman
Aber esse Mama Müsli auf
Tja, das ist wie der Ek so ist
Ich date heut Beate Zschäpe
Sie sieht aus wie bei Exorzist (aber?)
Aber kennst ja, einmal blasen geht, ne?
Ja, ich bin ein Mimimi
Heul doch, Digga, Mimimi
Kanaken hören Jiggi-Beats
Verkaufen dir das Billigweed für ziemlich viel, hihihi

Und Samy ist aus Afrika (Afrika)

„Noch ein special Mimimi
Mein Mann Chefket aus Berlin
Via der Türkei
Let's go, Bro“

Dis is' Chefket, kein Vorzeigetürke, Rapshit
Ich komm so rein, dann gibt es später kein Missverständnis
Ich hab das beste aus zwei Kulturen in mir vereint
Am plakativsten wär' jetzt 'n bisschen Spätzle und Chai
Bilingual mit zwei, trilingual mit zehn
In zwei Ländern zu Hause und ich kann alles verstehen
Doch viele wollten mich verarschen während ich mit Farben klecker'
Sie kommen und sagen: „Nur eine Farbe wäre besser“
Ich war nie gut im Mal- und Kunstunterricht
Schwarzweiß kann ich nicht malen, wenn alles bunt ist für mich
Und wenn man sich den Kopf über die fremde Dummheit zerbricht
Stellt sich die Frage: Warum eigentlich?
Einerseits, andererseits, ich bin mitten drin
Isst du Schweinefleisch? Nur wenn sie beschnitten sind
Identität kann für mich nichts damit zu tun
Irgendwelche Nationalhymnen mitzusingen

It’s all I want
And I got a feeling, that you’re gonna give me some
It’s all I want

You know the type of women that I like
The ones that understand my life
The ones that understand wrong is right
Let’s do some wrong tonight
You name it I’ll do it, all is the fluid,
I'm Spanish fluent, that means my tongue is bilingual
Ready to play with that spot that you tingle
Uh got a dingo, she’s a star, Ringo
Her and two friends? Mm, I like that lingo
She asked if I’m single
I said of course not, and she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public

You know I love an open mind (mind)
So I can see what you thinking (thinking)
That way I could give you exactly what you want
Matter of fact what you drinking
Some call it pimping, I call it leverage
I call it slipṗing, they call it marriage
She got me up like the Eiffel tower
No Paris, momma you can fuck like the rabbits
But no diamonds, no karates
She asked if I was single, I said of course not
And she loved it

Staying out, sleeping when we can

I take my money, I spend it all
Standing on the couch just showing love
Don't give a damn

Somewhere out the space, never on the ground
Always turning up, never turning down

It was this blind man, right?
Man, check this out- it was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick, right?
Hey, he walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'?
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said,
Woo, good morning, ladies.

You like that shit, man? 
Hey, man, I got a gang of that shit, man.

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns,

Sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.
So roll, roll, roll my joint. 
Pick out the seeds and stems.
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims.
So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville.
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, 
I bet my caddy will.

Well it was just sundown in a small white town. 
They call it Eastside Palmdale.
When the Afroman walked through the white land, houses went up for sale.
Well, I was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cd's 
When I met a little girl named Jan.
I let her ride in my Caddy 
Cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan.
We fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', 
Fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro.
Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right. 
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white.
I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a Zebra!
I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way, 
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet.
I ran, I jumped out the back window, 
But her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4.
Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. 
The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night.
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy I ever had.
I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. 
I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time.

I met this lady in Hollywood. 
She had green hair, but damn she looked good.
I took her to my house, cause she was fine, 
But she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine.
I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African.
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice. 
I ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice.
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. 
I met a woman in the heart of Australia.
Had a big butt and big titties, too, 
So I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo.
See, I met this lady from Hawaii. 
Stuck it in her ass, and she said, ay!
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, 
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch.
Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky. 
She said, I'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me.
I came in her mouth. 
It was a crisis. 
I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices.

Her titties were filled with Hennesy.
That country music nearly drove me crazy, 
But I rode that ass and said, Yes, Miss Daisy!
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma.
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again.
Met a real black girl in South Carolina, 
Fucked her 'til she turned into a white albino.
Fucked this hooker in Iowa. 
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her.
Fucked this girl, down in Georgia; came in her mouth. 
Man, I thought I told ya.
Met this beautiful sexy ho; 
She just ran cross the border of Mexico.

Have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck, 
But the pussy just ain't no good? (say what?)
And then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet, 
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood?
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy, 
But it takes her so long to cum (say what?)
Then a dude walks in. That's her big boyfriend, 
And he asks you where you from? (Where you from, man?)

So you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (I don't bang.), 
You start talkin' real fast.
But he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife, 
So he starts beatin' on your ass.
Now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody, 
Your dick was hard but now it's soft. (what?)
You thought you had a girl to rock your world, 
Now you still gotta go jack off.

Yeah I be actin' crazy, rappin' nasty
But don't get me wrong, I got sense
I'ma thank God on this song man
This song is dedicated to all the homeboys that almost died
But for some strange coincidental
Ironic reason you lived through it homeboy
But I'm here to tell you man
It's not a coincidence and it's not ironic
God got a plan and purpose for your life man
The Quarter Peace Quartet gon' help me sing it right about now, uh

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has (come on why'all) smiled on me (yeah)
He has set me free (like when them bullets just fly past you)
Ohhh God has smiled on me and He's been good to me (yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
Before I was a wild juvenile
I used to be a mild Christian young child
I used to seek and seek, search and search
Analyze everybody in my church
A 1-2, I've seen a lot of hypocrites, religious fakers

Deacon whore mongers and offer takers
When I turned thirteen I thought church was fake
I took all I could take so I took a little break
I went to the world, bought a geri curl
And some crack to slice so I can do my own thang
The street life I didn't understand good
So I started gangbangin' to prove my manhood
Yeah, had fun packin' the gun
The baddest kid on the block was a Christian son
Went to the county jail not once but twice
Gamblin' with my life with the dealin' dice
{*chicken cluck*}

[Hook: Quarter Peace Quartet]
God has smiled on me (yeah)
He has set me free (haha yeah)
Ohhh God has smiled on me and He's been good to me
(uh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I got released in '94
Told my mamma I don't want to get in trouble no mo'
I want to find a job, obtain some wealth
Be independent like you and take care of myself
{*chicken cluck*}
I stopped bangin' (yeah) I really quit
But not the people I got into it wit'
Back in the day from Palmdale to L.A
They got beef wit me homie up until this day
To make a long story short I stepped out the tub
Walked around the corner to the local night club
Sittin' at a table, just doin' my thang
This when I got approached by this rival gang
His gang and my gang just got into it (just got into it)
I tried to explain I didn't do it (uh)
I told ya bro, since '94
I been straight man, I don't mess around no mo'

You know what he said man? he got smart with me
He said call the mortuary, order some flowers
You quit your game but we ain't never quit ours
{*faint chicken cluck*}
It got excitin', we started fist fightin'
Like Mike Tyson I was scratchin' and bitin' {*chicken cluck*}
A bunch of them started mobbin' me (mobbin' me)
Threw me on the floor and started robbin' me (robbin' me)
The things that they took from me wasn't nothin' major

Wallet, walkman, cheap little pager
They took my food stamps, took my knife
Took me and tried to take my life {*chicken cluck*}
I tried to fight back but my efforts was useless
Ain't know need to makin' up excuses, hey man
I was on the ground (ground) gettin' beat down (down)
Eight different people kickin' me around
I thought about all the bad things I did
When I ran from God as a little bitty kid
No sign, no reason, no clue, no warnin'
No fair nobody cared, 2 o'clock in the mornin'
Heavy licks they was layin' on me
But at the same time my momma, she was prayin' for me
Lights from the helicopter filled the air
And the police cars came everywhere, uh
I told Jesus ""I don't deserve You
But let me live and I'll serve You""
God has smiled on me

God has (come on why'all) smiled on me
He has set me free (can you sing it again?)
Ohhh God has (yeah) smiled on me and He's been good to me

[Outro]
Yeah man, uh, sometimes when I'm drinkin' man
I think about my close calls, you know what I'm sayin'
Times I almost got shot
Times I was commitin' crimes, almost got caught by the police
Man I think about car accidents that never happened
I think about homeboys I speak to one day
Next day they catch 50-60 years
Maybe even rest in peace, you know what I'm sayin'
So check this out man, yeah, we still alive, right?
God ain't through with us
So let's put it down man, stop all this madness
You know what I'm sayin'
Go on take care of some situations we need to take care of
And to all the homeboys that robbed me, hey man I'm still alive
So if why'all be so kind, go down there and buy my tape man
That'll make up them food stamps why'all took from me right

I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight

Maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yell tonight
I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight
Find a woman that want to make love tonight
A yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Let's get dumb
Drink some rum
Make my teeth and gum feel real numb
We'll be thinking bout survivin
While we're drinkin and we're drivin
Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry
Sober up lookin at an all white jury
Judge don't like no drunk like me
Punk might give me strike number three
Cause when I'm drunk and when I'm high
I don't give a damn bout a DUI
Let's just get lit
Dance like a nitwit
Try to talk to the women that we can't get with
Me and my staff make everybody laugh
If the beer runs out we can all go half
It's Friday night got the perfect weather
Let's get drunk together

Bacardi, Colt .45
Let's party we still alive
Tomorrow brings pain and sorrow
but tonight, we're all right
Drink that beer till your belly can't hold it
Tell the homeboys we fittin to get loaded
Rollin through the Ante-dope Valley out there
Hope the cops don't smell that beer on my breath
Cause if the sheriff
Catch a whiff
Of that fifth
It'll probably knock him stiff
Don't look dumb if my breath on hum
Stick your hand in you're pocket please, pass some gum
So the cops can't tell my breath smell
We won't go to jail
We'll go to Palmdale
With the beautiful women and the beautiful weather
We can both get drunk together

Baby I beg your pardon
But your outfit's givin me a hardon
Maybe some way, maybe some how
You could dance with me, right here, right now
Been lookin at you all night long
That DJ's playin my favorite song
Everything's splendid, don't mean no harm
Don't get offended when I pull your arm
I ain't felt this good since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again
It's Friday night, beautiful weather

Just like bums, we used to stay
In the slums of LA, by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for reps
Sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride
But my mamma never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school
Started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat
Shot an enemy from across the street

Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class
Rubbin' little white girls on the ass

Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt

I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world
So I bought me some khakis and a Gheri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL
I went to East Palmdale and started slangin' yell
Fo' sho'! I was makin' crazy dough
Shoulda dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut
Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whiskey and Bacardi
I sold dope to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes
Took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
A white man drove up to my spot
He said, â??Hey homeboy, what you got?â??
I put a fat rock inside his hand
About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
â??Get down, punk.â??

Jammed his head up against the bunk
Socked that Cholo in his chin
Black mother fuckers scared to jump in
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor
I kept talkin' shit cause I want some more
Back in town, we get along with the brown
Now I'm in jail, they tryin' to beat me down

Playin' in the NFL

Zeno plays for Colorado State 
I wish my homeboys much success

I avoid the cops, I use a decoy
See my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
To avoid the cops, I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

All my life I did nothin' but dealin'
Learned to rely on my gut feelin'
Yo name is what? What? I know you from where? Where?
I don't mean to seem vicious but you look suspicious

Stop talking 'bout drugs on the telephone
Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home
Stop fuckin' up, call me before you come
Stop telling these bitches where you got it from

How long can I sell?
The Sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges

Havin' conversations with my gang assailants
Do you think, we under police surveillance?

Asking questions giving suggestions
Pulling Smith an' Wessons on strange pedestrians
Cookin' crack up, dollar bills stacked up
Hope the cops don't backup, here they come man

How long, stop runnin', stop runnin', can I sell?
The Sheriff department's right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Hurry up, pass the tabs, turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go and snitch
Before the DEA kick the door off the hinges

Maybe I oughta stop sellin' water
Spend more time with my son and my daughter
But my drug life drug me away from my wife
She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife

The cocaine rockin' and the hood rats jockin'
The late night knockin' the drive way blockin'
Late at night I fantasize 'bout rappin'
But I gotta sell dope till it happen
For how long?

Hey, who is that, who is that man?
See you all fuckin' up, I got these looks
Yo man little rich kids comin' over here
That's what I'm saying now

You know they gonna snitch, they can't even lie to their parents
What the fuck you think they gonna do when the police pressure 'em?
Get to crying and shit, Afroman sold it to me mommy
He stays over there

How long can I sell?

Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges

I'm so paranoid, now God lay me down to sleep
Before the cops rape, please give me a beat
If they accidently kill me and I don't escape
Pray some white person, gotta video tape

Twinkle twinkle little little star
That looks like a police car
Shining on my dope spot
A police raid

I hope not
Little little homie hold my gun
I'm gonna fuckin' run
Where I run, I don't care

Throw that dope, anywhere
Cops chase me, through the hood
Straight in to the woods camera
Fly like lepord's

I hear, German Shepards
Freeze, hold it right there
Drug dealers, nightmare
Busted crack, criminal court
No black support

Handcuffs very tight, Baptist jury all white
They could never be my peers, sentence me twenty years
This rap so damn real, I'm glad I gotta record deal
If I don't sell a mill, this could, could happen still
What a predicament

Afroman,"Yes! Yes! Thank you for inviting me here for my final speech.
Ladies and gentlemen, homosexuals, lesbians, and transvestites,
Allow me to introduce myself as the Hungry Hustler, Afroman.
I am the American Dream. Even though the government tried to experiment with me
By placing me in the projects, I'm still the American Dream.
Surrounded by drugs,
Jeopardized my life by living around thugs,
But I'm still the American Dream.
Kicked outta Palmdale High School
Because I was considered a distraction to the educational process.
I've traveled through the complete metamorphosis of the justice system,
And I'm still the American Dream.
Entered Juvenile Hall as a tadpole;
Hopped outta prison as a bull frog,
But I'm still the American Dream.
The most rejected, disrespected,
When I went for a job I was never selected,
But I am still the American Dream.
And right about now,
I find it quite serendipitous to see that all of you some-timin',
Wishy-washy, two-faced, back-stabbin',
Coniving hypocrites have accumulated here in my midst to persecute my character
With such flagrant slanderousity,
But I counter-attack by calling it constructive criticism,
And all of your negativity has been recycled into motivation,
And I am still the American Dream.
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found; was blind, but now I see.
There's a lot of people out there who can identify with me.
Young lady right here, you may be a single teenaged mother,
But you are still the American Dream.
The lady next to you, yes. Your breasts may not be as big as men think they should be,
But you are still the American Dream.
Young man, you may not be a baller, shot caller,
With 20 inch blades on the impala, but you are still the American Dream.
Young man right here, you may have spent all your money on a hood rat bitch
And didn't get no pussy last night, but you are still the American Dream.
Yes sir, I am just like Ham. I'm for the black man,
The mexican, and even poor white,
All human beings that have no rights. So put down your past, pick up your future,
Follow me as we journey through the Red Sea,
Cause I have been to the mountain top,
I've seen the Promised Land,
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Underground Category.
My mind has been delivered.
My spirit has been reinstated from the Corporate World's modern-day slavery.
I've been emancipated. Free at last! Free at last! Fuck a drug test,
I'm fittin' to roll some grass. Love, peace, and Afro grease, Fro-ever! Buccooocc!

Oh my lord, Oh my lord, what shall I do

I gotta feelin, that everything's gonna be all right
I gotta feelin everything's gonna be all right
I gotta feelin that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right
Be all right
Be all right

(A man it's funny cause I learnt this song when I was a little kid
When I went to visit my granddaddy down there in Mobile, Alabama
He stayed in this place called Trendy Garden you know what I'm sayin?
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And every now and then he'd get me to help him out know what I'm sayin?
And as he was like weedin out his garden and everything
He'd sing all kinda tunes and hymns know what I'm sayin?
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
You know what I'm sayin?
He'd get tired of singin the words
Sometimes he'd take a sip of his water outta that glass jar, set it back down
And while we was plantin them collard greens, he'd hum it
Just like this right here, help me out 'cause, you know how we used to do it)

{*humming*}

It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me want to sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth
And then I lose control
Cause I, I got this feelin, that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right
Be all right
Be all right",Hush,2001

Before South Central, Palmdale flossin
I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing
Hattiesburg, Mississippi
Smokin marijuana like a Woodstock hippy
All my homies in Laurel
Beg borrow
Buy my rap tape tomorrow 
Tell DJ Pumpkin ?Keep it crunckin Clyde?
Request my tape when you go inside
So I can take Jane and girl
To Waynesboro
Fuck their little homegirl
Make her toes curl
Rock their world
Leave with their Auntie Sheryl
She sucks me sucks me
Fucks me fucks me
Cries every time I leave Biloxi
But I hops in the Coup
Cause I gots to go
Scoop another ho
From Tupelo
Hit it once hit it twice, then I hit it again
Hit it in Meridian
Make that bitch rub her clit again
Pinch the nipples on her tit again
Suck my dick until she spit again

Please take me back home (Hell yeah)

I'm doin the most
Grab your 40 ounce, let's toast.

I sold rock cocaine down in Ellisville
Baseheads hit the pipe, they can tell it's real
Kept my dope stashed with this hoochie
Way down yonder in East Bouche

Sniffin my car with a hound dog
Separate me from my bitch and shit
Tryin to get my bitch to fuckin snitch and shit
Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane
Runnin warrant checks on the Afroman
But I can't be no hip hop star
Cuffed in the back of some police car
Did you find the gun? NO!
Did you find the dope? NO!
Open up the back door ?Well son, you're free to go?
A-F-are-O marijuana cargo
Flossed like a cholow
In a clean low glow
Come on let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Get nervous
As I swerve this
Cadillac through Purvis
Hope I don't crash when I hit Petal
Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto
Prejudice police won't let me go
So I'ma drive slow
Hide my fro
I was dumb, now I'm dumber y'all
last summer y'all
I fucked all the little girls down in Sumrall
Grabbed my guitar and started pickin a tune
For Nikki and June
Down in Picayune, baby
Just like a shovel I be diggin
All the pretty young women in Wiggins
On the boat
Gulfport
I got my dick down some girl's throat
I can't help it I'm a Crip baby
I think you need to wipe your lip baby
Hula Hula Hula
The whole house ruler
What's up with all the bitches down in Pascagoula
Small towns, small cities
But they still got big ole asses plus titties
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
It's the hungry hustler Afroman
Flyin through the air in my underwear
Geri curl activator in my hair
I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson
Always gettin plenty panty action
McClaine, even McComb
Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home
Yazoo, Columbia and Natchez
I got the weed brother, who got the matches?
Who got the funky DJ that scratches?
Depend on me like my name was patches
First it was a black thing, just the big Willies
Now I roll Phillies
With all the Hillbillies
Never ever thought I'd see the Klu Klux Klan
Buying front row seats for the Afroman
Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth
It's a beautiful thing jumpin off in the South
Afroman, I'm a part of it
Hattiesburg hip hop I'm the start of it
I'm the latest
I'm the greatest
And all you haters, I'll mash you like potatoes
I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream
Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens

She won't let me fuck, honey, yeah

Hey, check this out
It's so frustrating, yeah, being a man, yeah

If you want, you can take them both, baby

In the year 2000, I see thousands
Of pretty young women I find arousin'
Grocery store shopping, magazine browsin'
Many different ways they keep their hair styles

And full of boredom, I walk toward 'em
Get 'em close to me, 'cause I'm supposed to be
Be male aggressor, female impresser
Say the right things, possibly undress her

But that's the post game, this is still the pre game
Silly woman she game, baby, what's your name?
Even though I'm a freak, I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak

With intellect to the woman I select
Hoping that she won't detect
My egotistical, chauvinistical lust I thrust
'Til I scream like Mystical

The wrong message I hope I'm not sending
Laughing and pretending my dick's not extending
Can't be overzealous, she might discover
She's walkin' away, blew my cover

She won't let me fuck
(You know I love you)
I really need to bust a nut
(Please don't change the subject)

She won't let me fuck
(We coulda fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut
(But, but, but, but your telephone number is wrong)

She won't let me fuck
(Girl, you got a lot to give)
I really need to bust a nut
(You dress, you dress, so provocative)

She won't let me fuck
(I can see your lingerie, from real far away)
I really need to bust a nut

And if his eyes were pretty glazed,
And he looked spaced out would you buy hhis story,
Would yo believe he had an eye infection?

And yeah, yeah, god looks baked
And yeah, yeah, god smells good
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What is god smoked ?,
Hit the bong like some of us,
Drove a tydie microbus,and listens to rolling stones,


If god a place in the beging and did he grow any seeds ,
Or did he put them there for adam and eve,
So theyed be hungry for the apple that the snake was offerin

And yeah yeah god rolls great,
And yeah yeah god smells good,
And yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah,
What if god smoked ?,
Do you suppose he had a bus?
When he made the platipus,
He made it earth our home.
Does he like perljam or the stones?
And do you think he rolls his own,
Up there in heavin on the throne?
And when the saints go marching home,
Maybe he sits and smokes a bong.",What If,2004
Afroman,"I picked your legs down low to the ground 
Lickin' all the sweat droppin' off of her heels heels 
She walks my teeth too when she walks 
I held you down 
Oh missy you's a lot to learn 
If you wanna cry bitch go do it alone 
Don't take no darestime no not for me 
Just cut me out 

You crept up like a disease 
Lookin' like a girl who is tryin' to be seen 
Your heart was tryin' to beat 
Now get back in the river if you're talkin' to me 

Well you thought you'd tear my skin from bone 
Just 'cause it was cold and you needed a coat 
Tell Jesus you're still diggin' a hole 
Start digging now 
You can't stop sleeping tonight 
When you want to go home but you don't have a ride 
No time, just takes one touch from me 
My soldier's weight 

And you were there 
And I was every question that 
Never had an answer 
I see right through you 
And never even noticed that 
There always was a reason 
That we were never meant to be left alone 

And it feels like never ending 
This feels like never ending",Crazy Rap (Colt 45 & 2 Zig Zags),2008

Let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight

Drink some rum
Make my teeth and gum feel real numb

While we're drinkin' and we're drivin'
Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry
Sober up lookin' at an all white jury
Judge don't like no drunk like me

Punk might give me strike number three
'Cause when I'm drunk and when I'm high
I don't give a damn bout a DUI
Let's just get lit

Dance like a nitwit

Tomorrow brings pain and sorrow
but tonight, we're all right

Tell the homeboys we fittin' to get loaded
Rollin through the Ante-dope Valley out there
Hope the cops don't smell that beer on my breath

'Cause if the sheriff
Catch a whiff
Of that fifth
It'll probably knock him stiff

Don't look dumb if my breath on hum
Stick your hand in you're pocket please, pa** some gum
So the cops can't tell my breath smell
We won't go to jail

We'll go to Palmdale
With the beautiful women and the beautiful weather
We can both get drunk together

But your outfit's givin' me a hard-on
Maybe some way, maybe some how
You could dance with me, right here, right now

Been lookin' at you all night long
That DJ's playin' my favorite song
Everything's splendid, don't mean no harm
Don't get offended when I pull your arm

And I might not feel this good again

That something was wrong
And that things have changed
Cause girl i sit by the phone
And i wait for your call
But the phone never rings
So i picked up the phone and called you at home
You're on the other line,
I wanna talk to you maybe
Even see you, you say you have no time

You started doing things that
You never did before, how could
Something so right turn out to be
Something so wrong

You thought the grass was greener
You thought the well had water
You thought that you could find a
Love another place
So how could you leave this good thing

We use to take long walks
And have long, long talks
On the telephone
You use to hold my hand in the
Shopping mall, i felt i was your own,
We stopped going out as much
I started feeling all alone
Girl you stopped telling me you loved me
Saying that you cared
But i still carried on

I thought we could work things out
But i just don't understand why
How could you leave someone patient
Like me for something so wrong

Even though you, broke my heart in two
I was just hanging on, trying to do what
Was right and you were already gone

When love came you went away
And if i see you again
Girl i would ask you how could you
Leave this good thing

I've gotta spend my days working hard
To come home to myself

I try to compensate for you

Does he want ya
Does he wake up in the night

Does he flaunt ya

I see but now I see more,even feel their side of this tale
I realize their fate,no one's to blame, two sides

My life's a mirror that no one sees
so if I could show them my own vision to this world
My life's a mirror I need them to see,
so they would open up to me and fill up my emptiness

I still really try to feel, a strange experience to enter the other side
I feel there's so much we never said
It's all misunderstood, the emotions that we had

My life's a mirror that no one sees,
so if I could show them my own vision to this world
My life's a mirror I need them to see

Voice in the back of her head
Maybe if you would have the guts to open up
maybe the world would do the same,maybe,maybe
You can still be a part of this world,still be the queen of the ball
not of your own empty paradise where no one sees the beauty inside

Face the world outside my safe shell
I must face reality for once
I've never felt the passion of a warm life
Games, TV, I know they're not real, they're just a substitute

This could mean
the breaking point in these three lives
The moment of insight that could change their misfortune
Let this help be enough to make it
Let this be stronger than pain,the ancient wall between love and the comprehension
that will lead to the inner forgiveness
A reflection outside the circle of your life is all you should seek",Reflections,2004

The violence that is yet to come

Is catching up with us

Betrayed by all our gods

My heart is bleeding, bewildered, I'm here alone
Why is there pain in a beautiful moment?
Why do I feel so lost, so empty?

Cry with a smile
My heart is healing from pain I knew that would come
Why is there luck in a deeply sad moment?
Why do I feel so calm, so peaceful?

Take my heart and set it free
Take my heart and give it time to heal
I know in my memories you'll live
Take my heart a little while
Take it with you to the place you'll go
I know we will meet again someday

Cry with a smile
My heart was dreaming of time I knew would come to an end
Why do I cry about a beautiful memory?
Why do I feel so hurt, so lonely?

Take my heart and set it free
Take my heart and give it time to heal
I know; in my memories you'll live
Take my heart a little while
Take it with you to the place you'll go
I know we will meet again someday

",Cry with a Smile,2007
After Forever,"You fake, you give nothing but misery
You are reluctant in your vanity
Your eyes are blinded by your conceit
You turn my fire into negative energy!

You are estranged by your jealousy
A weakness in your personality
Your lack of social skills annoy me
You fuel my hate by your negative energy

I see a false alliance causing all this pain
I see a sick relation ending up in vain
I see a world at war because of pride and might
I feel we're all getting de-energized

I am amazed by your ability
To make me feel all this insanity
I am discouraged by your falsity
You sink so low to get things done your way

I see a false alliance causing all this pain
I see a sick relation ending up in vain
I see a world at war because of pride and might
I feel we're all getting de-energized

Unwilling, absent, dissenting
Conflicting, adverse, annoying
You're cureless, painless, disgusting
False, ruthless, blinded, recusant

You damage, injure and destroy
Unbalanced, troubled and unfaithful
You're senseless, heartless and fearless
Cold, hostile, distant and empty
You're a freak

You won't get closer to my dignity
Something you've lost, just like empathy
I won't degrade to your pathetic ways
Nor let you take any more positive energy

I see a false alliance causing all this pain
I see a sick relation ending up in vain
I see a world at war because of pride and might
I feel we're all getting de-energized

",De-Energized,2007
After Forever,"You need to get out of my sight
A lonely heart can beat
You're too dangerous
A lonely heart can bleed

I cannot stand it, to be enclosed and isolated
A lonely heart can be enclosed but isolated

You're too much
A lonely heart is weak
Too dependent
A broken heart will seek

You take the life out of me
No heart is broken forever
It's broken promises
But my faith is broken forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The power that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

A lonely heart will break
Pressure will make me forsake you
A lonely heart won't forsake me
As if we're both the same

Wounded and beaten but still not defeated
A lonely heart can be wounded and beaten but still not defeated

'Cause I won't let you in
So if it's all for real
Your weakness will be my strength
Your heart should be melting

You might be lonely
But I am not beloved and bounded forever
Because we're all the same
Beloved and bounded forever

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
The smile that was given light now seems to freeze but why?

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe
The power between us?

Oh, discord, see them fail, oh

Won't you believe?
Won't you embrace it?
Can't you believe in the power between us?
Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?

This is not a dream but something in between that and reality
Wake up if you dare
This is not the regular nightmare

Before your eyes the world will change
Slowly take you down to unknown places
Welcome to a world that's only yours
Wake up if you dare and just follow me!

Leave me alone
My dreams speak to me or am I still awake?
Leave me alone
I'm my own threat, I'm a victim of my mind
Let go

I fooled you, I warned you though
I won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams
I'll play you
You want me to
You ask for more
You want to know

Leave me now, I need to know I'm in control
Leave me alone
Leave me be within my private fantasies
Let go

I told you you, I won't let go
I want to show you what dreams can do for you
They'll free you, they'll open doors
They show you all you want to know

As some is light and some is dark, dreams can be both
They have two sides

Fear
I am your fear deep inside

Fear
Face all your fears deep in this dream
We are the dark side of your mind
Pain
I am your pain deep inside

Pain
Feel all your pain deep in this dream
Feel it's a part of you
You are like your dreams, both light as dark
Come with us now and explore

Silence, I'm here
No words, no sounds, no pain or doubts
I'm floating
Even time itself can never touch me
I am free

Silence, I'm here
No voices, no music
I'm roaming through this soundless place
Leave me here where I am free

Doubt
I am your doubt deep inside
I am all you try to hide
Hate
I am your hate deep inside
I am your mirror, your fright

Energized by nightly views
You are the dream, the dream is you
Aah

So face it, you know I'm right
You have no reason to resent me and fight
You are me and I am you
The other side of the sleepy truth

Leave me please, how can I rest with you inside?
Leave me alone, I'm too tired for these crazy theories
Let go

I'll leave you, but won't let go, for I am part of all you'll ever do
I'll help you, I'll open doors and show you all you need to know
For I'm your dream energizer

Cold as stone
Must welcome these memories
As shallow as my eyes have slowly become

Hearts, frail heart left broken
Cold and known for its bitter agony
Here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become
Sting, crush and bite in my soul
My heart bleeds

Times changed forever that night
Leaving only empty memories
Empty memories won't heal the pain

We know only sorrow
There's no future in tomorrow
All our hopes were buried too young
For the years that should have followed

We know only hatred
There's no future in our anguish
For all hope is buried with life
And reprisal will be ours

It's empty
We're empty
They're empty memories

Here, here in this heart
Cold as stone, for no feelings there to warm
It is as empty as our dreams and hopes
Now our future is gone
It stings and bites in my soul

Just envision, the only way to relate

We try to
We say so but we can only imagine
We want to but can't empathize

She's lying there crying
For the truth was stronger than her pain
Her feelings go way beyond my own

Only sense it
Only imagine their fate

Its massive spirits bright

Dare to concede and to connect

Lashing winds, hot suns and rain

And will outlive all circles of time

It's terribly sad but true,

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

We're losing time
We won't win this fight
Until our hearts collide

We were running away from nothing fast
Falling down until we finally crashed
My god, oh my god, can you help me feel anything?
I'm lost in a city of vultures, moths, and pigs
Eating away at everything, oh well, yeah, oh well

Sometimes I wish I was never born in Hollywood
I get so scared
I don't know how to walk
I'm always running unprepared

I'm losing my hope
I'll sell myself for an hour of fame, I know, it's a shame
But I don't care
'Cause you forget who you are when you come to Hollywood

This party never seems to end
When the drugs that kill are our best friends
Keep showing up and acting out
Even though we thought we threw them out

Hello, hello hospital
Look up to the sky
It's time to go

I wanna be buried by your side
Underneath a tree that's hard to find, oh well, yeah, oh well

Sometimes I wish I was never born in Hollywood
I get so scared
I don't know how to walk
I'm always running unprepared

I'm losing my hope
I'll sell myself for an hour of fame, I know, it's a shame

I been dreamin' about a world out there that's just so beautiful
I been thinkin' about a world out there that's just so beautiful
It's just so beautiful to me, to me

But always finding my way back to you, the one
I need when I'm awake.

And all his fears had killed him dry'

Is worth the pain
Then to hear her cry your name.

After One,"I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

The other way
As they are kissing

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice

And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began

I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train",Tom's Diner Rap,1991

After the Burial,"The sweltering heat sweeps through the blood, raising internal rage
The escalation of annoyance converts fingers to fists
Ready to smash the moral wall retaining the release, restraining the release
Wash over placid with flooding waves of hate
Diverge the silence with cathartic piercing screams
Unleash on your enemies a sweeping firestorm
Laying devastation upon those who haze you
Forever they curse you
Forever loathing the day they unraveled the fabric of your innocence
Gnawing at every tame fray, leaving only vengeance
A sheltered source of inspiration for your master plan to lay everything to waste
With no aggressor, without a foot to stamp out every garden of hope
Plant a row of remorse, and a crop of forgiveness
Raise yourself in a better world",Engulfed,2007
After the Burial,"(Your feminine) fingers are like daggers
Tearing me apart, with each caressing stroke
My scars unravel cruel history
Our love was stab wounds and lusty kisses
In your eyes I see wasted tears for wasted years
and heartache, heartfelt for granted
You left me with nothing but the desire to overcome
This gaping wound from where you stole my vital organ
But keep it with you, a trophy for yourself
Still you linger for another gaze
Die away from me
I won't stand by while you plague the air with your lies and deception
My shirt stained crimson, from long nights of anguish
These scars are forever, but this won't be eternity
You wash away guilt in the oceans of my tears
I will drown you",Fingers Like Daggers,2007
After the Burial,"Every time your lips spill their poisonous words
They infect the ones you claimed to have cared for
We are gored by your serrated ways
We shed our faith, we've bled oceans for your cause
We shed our faith in your atrocity
We've come to claim a thousand lives to live
Open hands will shape what little time we have 
We exude our servitude to a lifetime of deceptive worship
Righteous hands will rise, if only to redeem the city of the gods
And in ourselves we trust
A thousand fists will rain
This mighty downpour will wash away
There is new hope in every open eye
Promise to ourselves that these words will never die
We exude our servant hood to a lifetime of immoral worship
Righteous hands will rise, if only to redeem the souls of the meek

The ash will scatter of what has not remained
The ashes have buried you",The Forfeit,2007

I'll dig through the remains of my ruins
Unearthing something truly remarkable once hidden by your opaque heart
I'll carry out plans of old. Digging through the remains of my ruins 
From this day forth, your love will poison no longer
A strange suffocation, enticing existence
It's comforting, the artificial life
A ghostly bliss without your kiss

Damned to be deprived of the blissful warmth of heaven
As you dissipate into the shadows",Forging a Future Self,2007

To end this torture, clearing a forest of oppression
Can you taste the soil as it fills your lungs? 
To extinguish the fire, the fire burning in your eyes
You cannot stop the scorching. We'll lay you down on your eternal bed
The soothing touch of a wrathful hand
You leave the sky, encased in the earth

but we've shattered our own glass hearts

Today has taken a bloody toll, but the nightfall will claim your life
Claim your life tonight
Her majesty will swallow you, she'll devour you

Watch you hit the sanguine ground like autumn leaves
With each nail driven you drift away
This somber burial is a calamity
Rise from your casket and kiss new breath from me
To those who can't behold your fading moonlight beauty
radiating from your precious eyes, a tender gaze
Never witnessing an instance when you held time still forever in your matron hands

In dormancy lies everlasting

We feed the burning for a better day

Die defending that which your heart keeps closest

Never fear, there's always more blood

I, your liege, now command your rule again

But the gods can't destroy my cursed, blackened heart
Appeasing the thirst of the damned, mocking the praised ones
The sand soaks the blood, the blood flows like wine, send death from above
Locusts and famine engulfing your race, my savagery knows no end
At the price of all your lives, I destroy your kind, death by my hand

Pursue what may never come

Push it down, its hideous face below the water

After the Fall,"Aquarius,

So curious, 
Lips are red like a hilltop forest fire.
Oblivious,
Voice so sweet like a songbird singing choir.
So tell me now,
What's in your head?
My patience hanging by a thread.

'cause I am the fighter,
And you are the fists tht bruise my face.
This burning desire,
Her innocence is such a waste. (x2)

Feel the lust,
Tip the scales like a prison ball and chain.
And take this trust,
Once it's gone it can never be regained.
'cause it's a must,
Truth be told all secrets see the light.
Tell me why?

And you are the fists tht bruise my face.

And clanging cymbals till I couldn't hear
Your screaming anymore.

I used to speak in the tongues of angels,
All I ever say now is goodbye.

And I'll set myself on fire as a beacon
Through the shadow that my life has been
But I would only smolder
Because I would not burn for anyone
When I had the chance.

All I ever say now is goodbye.

I've been trading sight for lights and mirrors
Falling headfirst into failure
I want to see You face to face.

Se riesco ad ignorare che gli alberi son morti

Tourniquet to keep the silence secret

Bending with every breeze, you're a
Tall desperate flower, you're a
Waving suicidal desolate hour

Pantomime is your tragedy
It's a thin line here between you sorrow
And your cunning

Desire, desire froze here
Just looks like love from a distance
Desire, desire froze here
Just the path of least resistance

Sooner or later time goes
Leaves you behind

With the winter and the splinters
A disintegrating thing

Thrown into a hole
Dust to dust there
Dug with your own bones

Through the seaweed there's a hero
Feeling pretty down
Longing only to surrender
But no-one can be found

Every dawn now from this moment
Brings a deadly dew
But nothing undermines a minute
Of the me and you

You gotta be perfect
Whenever you fall
You gotta be perfect
Whenever you fall
You gotta be perfect
Now you're in free fall

Desperate, stoned and scrambled, broken
How beautiful you seem
You know you gotta betray somebody
To get back where you been

Don't you let the road and journey
Devour your skin and heart

Is the greater part

Aftershock,"Twisting path and rolling hills, imprisoned by thy selfish will, this wonderment suffocates me. Twisting path and rolling hills, I doubt virtues you instill, this wonderment suffocates me. Twisting path and rolling hills, secrets told while truths lie still, this wonderment suffocates me. Through my eyes, I have seen majestic ends justify poverished means. You exemplify preconceived connotations, I symbolize eminent transformation. Contrive your obscure repetition. Conceive my ascension from self ambition. Twisting path and rolling hills, impossive petulance it kills, this wonderment suffocates me. Twisting path and rolling hills, your vassal shell cannot fulfill, this wonderment liberates me. The time has come now child, there is no turning back. Succeed to yourself, transcend reflections mirrored in those eyes of glass. RISE!

Afu-Ra,"You know I'm like a hop, skip and jump from slappin' you senseless
Perverted monk on this mic, you feel the sentence
Hot vernacular scorch just like incense
I'm intense, shit vibin' like a sixth sense

Lyrics mutilated like X-men
Shower ya, devour ya, technique algebra
Smoothness, movements, halloed in the matrix
Fist held high, I raise it up to the ancients

Insightfully clear to you, how a master do
Roll with the high and mighty flow tai chi
Quench ya thirst, but first my journal high seas
Lyrical, mathematical, razzle and dazzle you

East New York, street talk, step with a better game
Hydrate rhymes like I was Gatorade
Rockin' a name, tappin' your brain
With the sugar Shane Mosley doin' it like it's supposed to be

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

Avoid the devil's army, they want to harm me
Salute to the Gulliani, crack babies, and zombies
Parkin' lots and drug spots, in the pots are coke rocks
A million in the building, buildings protected by more blocks

Young childs, ghost smiles, money clips colored vials
Stash fifty, in the world of bird city the warranters
Send the foreigners the coroners
A mess no vest multiplied wounds on chest

Invest in free markets, cream cheese and pockets
Three keys to a promise, stash keys in compartments
Desert eagle my targets, hit ya lease I spark ti
We get the drop on ya spot, make it hot and unlock it

Firearms make fireworks, I wonder where lies lurk
We bloodied up your shirt, all you saw was the fire spark
I'm one of too many, who get amped off Henny
Puttin' cowards in cemeteries, kill willies for pennies

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly
Straight up and down, streets bouncin' off the melody

Sex, butchery meat rack material, superior
Crank that shit amplify the whole scenario
Off the level live or in stereo
Young hustle to stay ahead of step

From where your best bet is to rep yours, repetitiously
'cause this veteran will thrash to wreck yours, repetitiously
If ever you get at me on some bullshit, flash quick
Exactly who the fuck I got pull with

Autographed it for big number one with a bullet
Expressin' black glove love hood it down, how I put it down
This style ain't never been shit to me, why would it now?
I come forth with gun smoke, no petty read ya bound by honor

That I mark you in the hunt for a dollar
Alive on the strength of power you
Divine karma, Allah's armor see you keep fraudulatin'
I'll sick my wolves in your basement, with loaded shell casings

They think they all that, steppin' on them like they were doormats
We bounce back and slap you with the raw tracks
Heatin' it up steadily, so heavenly

You know what I'm sayin'?

No need for cappin' this, brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, math this, lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin sandstorms, I'll freeze ya then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These [Incomprehensible], I'm wieldin', straight echoes through the building

Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of a eye
Terminate, unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars while they constellate
The heart rate of my social eloquence makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know when you lookin' at a real nigga

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch, the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
The snakes out, hissin', shots missin', observe and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin' wit loaded dice
It's like gettin' stabbed with ice and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt

Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flower, fresh shower
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin', ride the 808 rollin'
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

We rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves than the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than the fuckin' cactus
Conquerin' globes and universes with Galactus

Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin' intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes, the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate but now I'm yellin' checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin' they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

We rip it up, hit the mic like a virus

Afu-Ra,"[Chorus]
If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you want to rock the ice, and your style is tight
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
It's the, rap spectacular, cardiovascular
You see these lyrics they gonna laugh at ya
You want to take it to the streets movin backwards
Straight up and down, you get slapped up like Cassius
And if they want holes hook 'em with a catheter
Mental manipulation like Blackula
Controllin forces knockin soldiers off their horses
Whether the Benz or the Rolls Royce's
Ain't nothin close to kilometer Testa Rosa
Body barometer, pop just like a toaster
I heat and freeze it off simultaneously
Instantaneously, ain't no one worthy but me
I hold my head like a sire for a second
The state of hip hop in my head went through blizzards
Now I hokus pokus regain my focus
I got to keep it movin move smoother than Braggadocios

[Chorus]
If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop a slug, gimme a clue
If you want to shock the sights, and you're outta sight
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
Inferable, impenetrable, mineral, serial
Spiritual, visuals, sprinkle mics with my lyricals
I use astrophysics and aeronautics
Biologically technical unpointed message view
The type to snatch danger right out your passage view
I bring it back to the essence was
Exodus, want to get next to us
Honeys doin doobies, but the booties gettin rushed

[Chorus]
If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop the bubb', gimme a clue
If you want to rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
You got beef that I'm a stomp with this, bombs I launch wit this
Peep the flames from my orifice, I'm off wit this
Betta call your boss for this, I'm squashin 'em, you
ain't goin far my friend
Insatiable unstoppable, syllable, module
It's logical the diabolical after my molecules
I had to enhance my thought pharmaceuticals
Lyrics is literal paintin pictures daily rituals
I like to free verse from coast to coast
On boats and boast, files be dope and dope
Open scopes, Afu is like hope on a rope
Goin for broke, I make sing somethin I wrote

[Chorus]
If you want to rock the clubs, you can to
If you want to pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you want to rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right
If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop a slug, give me a clue
If you want to rock the ice, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
Peep this modern day follow through, nothin will boggle you
Suggest I hit them with the darts, now they jiggle too
Now ladies taste a lick, and lick the lyrical liquor
Takin a swigger, checkin her figure, countin her figga's
Some roll through on that real type Perrelli 'ish
Some roll through on that meet me at the telli 'ish
Evidently, evidence stains for centuries
I carve my name in your head like I'm a memory
I'm composin with the Beethoven slogan
Year 3000 on the run like I'm Logan
Change the gases, switch my anti matter
You see I spent about ten life times as a rapper

[Chorus]
If you want to rock the clubs, you can to
If you want to pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you want to rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right
If you want to rock the clubs, you can too
If you want to pop a slug, give me a clue
If you want to rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right
If you want to go to clubs, you can too
If you want to pull the plug, gimme a clue
If you want to rock the mic, and your style is right

Afu-Ra,"Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

S-T, supreme teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin' the snakes who lay awake
Lovin' to hate but we still elevate

Massagin' the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I walk with the understanding, build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya

Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin' in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doing my Calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin' the hex, cursin' the sexist

Accepting my blessings, remembering my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions
When he told me keep my smith and Wesson
For protection, the streets is watching and they testin'
They know when you're frontin' and when you're representin'

It's not where you be or how you be
Or who you be or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin' through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be and where you be?

You wanna get with the brothers, that's the illest
The microphone have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while

Flippin' and turnin' and splittin' it, all type positions
Grabbin' and tuggin' and yokin' it, all type of missions
Crazy, nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers

I heard you're drippin', your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese, yo

But this is hip hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player hatin', on the mic I'm player scrapin'
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to Zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual

Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow

Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly rollin' a phonta leaf
You know it's beef when you gettin' stomped losin' teeth
Because you sweet and ain't got no claims to the street

You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big glock that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin' up in that little cell block?

I'm tellin' ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house

Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin out skeeze out of custom drop-top v's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin' the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, the dice stay on the six

Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem seven seas, dem, ah, throw stick and stone
M-mh, dey gonna melt like snow cone
Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown

Well, some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah bafoon, dem ah goon
Cartoon, dem nah put out no conscious tune

A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring

Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine
Trust me, we don't fear nothin
So don't boost up yourself like you are gon' do me somethin'

Mi turn dem off like mi turn of mi light
Jah control di better part of mi life

Peep the finisher, blemisher, menace to sinister
It's him with the, been with the, mic's Next to kin with the
Lyrical assassinate like toxic waste
Rocks is base, matches I burn up in your face
Travel through eons, mentally to spit it viciously
Slapping up these red-eyed devils, speaking fictitiously
They slipping be	, snippin the, mic styles they slippery
A golden aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore the
Monumental essence, which crowds wish to adore the
Shimmering stone, lace like stylish, luscious, Tiffany
Sages when they meditate, prism filling my imagery
Subliminally, thoughts I set it, Synchronisticaly
The intricacy, complex levels my entity
No stopping me, I'm rocking the, Hip-Hop philosophy
Drummer drum it, preserve myself to keep me omni-potent
9 9 styles I keep it flowing

Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to say, ay
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared, now I say

[Chorus]
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop
What, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop

Meditation, equality, it keeps me level headed, the men-tal-ity
Cool, calm, posignatic with suggestion
Never stressin', heat chambers never sweatin'
Honeys cryin', 'cause her man she caught cheatin'

Mothers eyein', sons cut down like bushes
Daddys sicker than the land lord, just evicted
Stressed to death, month to month until he kicked it
I seen ya hustlin' on the dark streets, the mental

Look what you been through, you just escaped reality
Now what ya into, is just a technicality
Check it, deep inside of my head like T.V.
The lifestyle I live so crooked you won't believe me

Lessons learned that I could walk a tight rope
Even though I toke and choke, don't provoke
Uh, now you can call me Afu-rastahood
'Cause I rob from the rich and I give to the good

Even though it's for the money b, I'm droppin' dollars G
Straight shots in the head, peep the summary
Wake up in the mornin' got me yearnin' for food
Yeah, yeah what, huh, I'm that type a dude

Pledge allegiance, pay attention, payin homage
So much time held in my hand, none for college (college)

[Chorus]

Hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu

Slow down, don't rush, 
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to bust
They want to cut my meditation with their crooked laws
Say I can't hold a bong and smoke my la

If it's war that they want we already are registered
The king, it is he, who defends me
So when it's time for the showdown 
We'll march in the soldiers Babylon, get throwed down

When the war is over we run up the whole town
And my spliff will stay lit from sun up to sun down
Ay, Afu

Stimulating, verses like blood working
Paper hits the pen like the needle to ya skin
Blow ya blood up, Xena, hero-in
More contagious than sex (sex), nobody flex

Dangerous minds, little kids throw gang signs
Treacherous times, too many can't press rewind
Stress the elevation, wrap my thoughts like a mummy
It's funny, how sometimes some smart one's a dummy

Scorin a million, forget the S.A.T.
Now I leap on towers in Piza, peep the ether
Wrap it in a scroll, pass it off to Carmani

Loose lips sink ships, ya drown this quick
Superbly, my words be, like third degree
Word to me, thoughts higher than planes be
It's funny to me, how my stun shines the jewelry

Bust ya shit like a blister, yeah, one, two, how we do

[Afu-Ra]
Mic stance, starts the illustration
As I dive into creation, wit so much patience
Split my drink up your nation, but never cleanin it up
Stainin it up, molecules, my energy melt the cup
I'm usin fake MC's for target practice
To usurp your experts, will be my best work
I'm takin stripes, might snipe ya, cause I'm hyper
Will incite the shit too loose, I'll make it tighter
Flowin on and on like I was nylon
Sounds gong, check ti, Brook-nom to Saig-gong
My chord sweeps, from off beat to on beat
Lyrical symbolism, peep the visions
I make incisions, fabric of ghetto rhythms
You couldn't hold me, if you wore gloves or mittens
Lion of Judah type style, and you're forgiven
I set it straight, my jade pen obliterate
You titillate, chop you up for my shark bait
Incinerate your presence, scatter your ashes
And breeze by on the mic, like EZ passes

[Chorus 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
I'm kinda killin a, willin a, instillin a, billin a
Yo, yo you talkin MC's, ain't nothin similar
Scatter ya, batter ya, internally ratter ya
Even through your dental records, they'd never notice ya
A dope style, so pure you couldn't touch it
Couldn't nudge it, diesel men, couldn't budge it
Terroristic type tactic, get your ass kicked
Never rested, jah blessed it, never test it
Undrownable, unsoluble, prolific
Lyrical typhoon crossin the Pacific
Chosen by the mystic, mic ways, I rip it
Usurp it, sharp enough that it can hurt it
Depth wise, verse wise, ensurin that the surge hits
Words hit, I do work like arthroscopic
Surgery, now my rhymes lacked the masonry, kinetic energy
Thoughts cause the imagery, natural disaster
Earthquake type telepathy
Yeah, one, two, how we do

""Uprising surprising""
			""Knowledge wisdom understanding""

[Afu-Ra]
Smooth like Johnny Cochran, I keep it movin through Brooklyn
Base against the hymn, brings the sweat to the skin
Reminisce of the days as a shorty
Had no stress, no bills, was comin for me
I lived it up, yeah, money ain't a thing
Never thought twice on what my future bring
Role models, naw I thought nothing of it
Eyes fixed on skies and planes fly high above it
Summer's comin, September's middle school
Mom Dukes mad strict, she'll never raise a fool
I'm comin up, clean the dirty from the ghetto
So we can plant some seeds and watch them grow

[Chorus]
Right, knowledge wisdom understanding rules, right
Everybody got to pay the dues, right
Knowledge, wisdom understanding rules
Everybody got to pay the dues

[Afu-Ra]
Tripped up by bad luck, 16 years and buck
I realized the world might end, not givin up
Stickin up, runnin up, comin up
Turn it up, I see signs of blowin up
Study life in every facet of my trainin
We need masters in biology, zoology
To overtake, Illuminati trick-nology
Transform, reciprocate your mental state
Now make a date to overtake your objective
Show that through light, that everything is connected
But not in categories, that's the Devil's story
Symbols of cannibalism, ruin your vision
The thoughts formulate in your mind with no precision
So reenact, a rebirth, now you're the Phoenix
When shorties see it, now that's the time they believe it
Achieve it, your goals in life, don't be a casualty
Infinite and intricate, monument

""Knowledge wisdom understanding""

[Chorus]

Right, knowledge wisdom understanding, rules

""Uprising, surprising""

[Afu-Ra]
I know the next millennium seems like it's cursed
That's why I have to rehearse
Tune my physical, mental spits the lyrical
It's so essential, transcends thoughts I'm into
As we continue, touch rhyme styles I'm into
All grown up, Junior High to 25
A made man, tight connection with my brothers
Bridgin gaps, dodgin traps with my raps
Signs you're followin, shed more light
Then a halogen, take a step back, now who you followin?

Afu-Ra,"Perverted monks style
'99 style, know what I'm sayin'?
Comin' at cha, this how we do

Paraplegic, my fightin' stance, too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much chi-horrific
To be specific, I'm comin' threw with Jiu-Jitsu
Bone crushin' bone breakin' as I get into

Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, iron palms is elemental
Combinations damagin' nations in the mental

Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains readin' scrolls

Holdin' it down, iron shirt chi-gung
Apprentice in the temple with guang-jung-nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinnin' kicks, side kicks, and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin' two styles on the Mic with Masta Killa

The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seein' through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it movin' factor

Sword swing it to the temple, mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bedstuy

Wang Chung from Lafayette, stuy versant and Malcolm X
Fifty seven park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featurin' Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one

Young Chun, prodigal son, killa bees disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinnin' roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin' two styles on the Mic with Masta Killa

The key is self mastery, mentally and physically
Escapin dramas, plaguin the world, it's never easy, G
Society is straight up, set up to hurt you
Indirectly, with God logic, it's diabolic
Let me kick it most importantly trick-nology
Leave that similac alone, breast feed your seeds
The gift of motherhood, you pass on your antibodies
Defense against sickness, unwanted virus
Realize we came to this land by savage pirates
Never migrated, forced dehydrated
Instrumental tools, so knowledge dilapidated
Forced to bring it back, the most high heals the wounds
From the time you conceived, to the day you lay in tombs
Reeducate thy self from spoken fables
Descendants of the kings and queens who made it stable
Whose anatomy contains royal genealogy
You're no the minority, the unseen majority
Communicatin brother to brother before a dialect
Developed longevity, built the first community
Understood the science of healin through herbology
First open heart surgery was under King Zoasa
Erectin pyramids livin off the Nile River
There's so many unknown facts about self, I shiver
I stop a second, think to myself, it make me quiver
I must reach right inside of the self and just deliver
Rays of light of the Sun, through the stratus
Peace as I release this apparatus

[Afu-Ra]
You never heard of this, murderous, mic style superb with this
Burn with this, learn with this, you couldn't swerve with this
Or speed up on me in a high speed chase
Shift the clutch and what, bump chumps, I rip it up
I'm hangin corners, type ship like Lamborghini
You couldn't see me, solar rays scorch Houdini
You know my essence, hip hop and energy
Soul Assassinate ya, never hate ya
It's deep thought, while you drink my Henneccy
This deep sport, right where the winners be
I'm takin over, sounds glide like genocide
I'm never sober, write my rhymes, like a roller
It's so much colder, as you bounce into the lunar
Don't be confused a second to get your wreck in

Don't make me want to walk a winner
Walk it iller, stalk a sinner, walk beginners

Mess around, you get stuck like Orca nigga

Britches got too big, don't make have to walk a sinner
Next day maybe they have to come and chalk a winner

Your nose bleed, battle wit me, rhymes bleed

AS long as you know, train freeze likes of Pluto
My wordplay firm-lay, in Zero gravi-tay
I be the dentist and you, you be the cavi-tay
Or neurosurgeon, brain work pathogen
Fro your consumption, first thing is oxygen
Throwin out 4 pages to be box ya in
Lock ya in, rock ya sin, you'll see directions in

Don't seek exception, touchin all side of the waters

Exuberate, and motivate, exasperate

Now it's about to be talked about

You're gettin' slapped by my grammar
Vocals like a hammer with roots from Alabama
I'm under cover, make moves like no other
In dark alleys, you're gettin' opened from your belly

I rock spots for blocks, I knock you inna Skelly
I know you're jelly, because Fame, Billy and I be
Mashin' out crews of bad dudes for nothin'
Or 'cause they frontin', they corny style, I show 'em somethin'

A buck fifty ear to ear smash and fear
I'm scrubbin' down, this hip hop shit's infested
Too many niggas sexin' the mic, they not protected
Don't get infected, like a child that's been molested

Clack clack, move son I got nothin' to lose son
There's a million and one ways to die, choose one
Hit or miss, it won't matter to peel yo ass
I'm still left with a million ways to kill yo ass

Where the innocent get slain
And what you visualize will ruin your brain
A lot a blood sweat and tears, pain

Nobody stop a murder, as a dealer does it's muthafuckin' thing
Bang bang, just like that, the man'll slit open you
And put two under your hat
And as you lay flat just another nigga whacked

Before he stepped, he threw three through your chest through your back
And your outta here, lights out, game over
You said, you wanted to live life as a soldier
I told ya, we on shaky grounds, a lot of ups and downs
We on force, to run a crash course and blast off rhymes

And of course we have emotions inside, yeah
That's just some shit that we been trained to hide
You hear, be cautious, nigga walk slow
Talk low, this ain't no muthafuckin' talk show, this is
