Hawk & Garcia,"Yeah, What (repeat 7x)

Lil' Flip, David Banner, Three Six Mafia
Houston Texas, Mississippi, Memphis Tenn. what?

[Lil' Flip]
They told me I can't talk about ice no more
But they ain't tell me I can't start another fight no more
I get it crunk in the club, niggaz get drunk in the club
When I perform me a hoe, niggaz get jumped in the club
But I'm used to that shit, so it ain't no need to run
And just because you gotta gun don't mean that's the only one
So if you came here to chill nigga, just chill and shit
'cause you ain't gotta act like that I know you feelin' this shit
I bet, I bet I could hit with Juicy, Paul and Banner
I gotta holla at peaches, when I hit Atlanta
'cause I'm fresh and I'm clean, with baugettes in my ring
I got my name on my jersey like I play with that team
I'ma H-Town nigga and we bang (SCREW TAPES!)
And them FEDS kick in yo door you about to (LOSE WEIGHT!)
So just take it like a man, don't snitch on ya man
It's Lil' Flip, representin' Clova Land

[Chorus 1: Lil' Flip]
I'm reppin' H-Town until the day that I die
If you look me in the eyes you could tell I'm high
Yeah you could talk that talk, but you can't walk that walk
'cause when it's time to ride nigga, I won't get caught
(repeat)

[David Banner]
I'm from the J the A the see to the K..Town, Mississippi bitch
And boy we'll blow off ya face
Like Nicholas Cage, the way that I feel is trill
Fuck a dollar bill, I live for the slaves that got killed
From the white sheets walkin', snitch nigga talkin'
Dump him in the ditch and let them dogs start barkin'
Like WOOF!, nigga stop beggin' me please
How you gon' walk and talk shit if I blow off yo knees
I'll have ya walkin' like a parrott do, stick foot pussy you
The boys play the law, so I'll kill them holla maker's too
I'm D.B.C., from the home of the G's
And the V.L.'s, bustin' 17 in ya see-L..K
Ya body don' got carried away
Mississippi til' I die bitch so have a nice day
Or a long ass night nigga
Yeah yo death is settin' in muthafucka ain't no need for you to fight nigga

[Chorus 2: David Banner]
Throw yo sets up nigga, and raise em' real high
David Banner in this bitch, Mississippi til' I die
(repeat 4x)

[DJ Paul]
Now I'ma M-Town reppa, like no other
Mask on my face cause I ride undercover
I'ma mean-mugga, a nigga hoe up from the show up
And stick the barrell down ya throat until you start to throw up
When I roll up, it is a hold up
Ain't nothin' funny don't breathe
Cause all I want to hear is ching-ching
Like casino slots, or this hot glock
Get cocked, leave a nigga shot in the parkin' lot
for his stash spot

[Juicy J]
No more gangstas in this bitch (this bitch)
With the tech's with the extra clip (extra clips)
And you know that we runnin' this thang (this thang)
Nigga step, I'ma let my nuts hang (nuts hang)
You can get yo ass shot popped, put off in a head-lock
Knock til' you see some knots, hit em' with the phop-phop
Shot yeah you boys in shock, just the way the fish dropped
Memphis, Tenn. in this bitch thought you knew we don't stop

[Chorus 3: DJ Paul]
We some M-Town niggaz and we gonna turn it out
Memphis, Tenn. in this muthafucka hoe, shut ya mouth

Hawk & Garcia,"[Chorus: x2]
This is how we, do it down South
Platinum and the gold, ice in our mouth
Fo's in place, Chi-Town fades
4's or blades, candy sprayed

Down here we like it big, on that Dirty coast
Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

[Chorus: x2]

Down South, yeah we ride on dubs
Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love
We just some thugs, with ice that glow and glisten
In a six hundred Benz, and the top is missing
Sit back and listen, cause what I'm saying is real
From Houston to Huntsville, boys got ice in grills
We love to chill, and ride on candy paint
Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank
Down South, we known as that Dirty Dirty
If you got your money right, I got them birdy birdies
They going for thirty, yeah you heard me clear
And if you didn't know nigga, that's how we do it down here

Down here, we be off the chain
Down here, we roll foreigns and wide frames
Down here, riding on dubs and 4 swanging
We staying iced up, from the heel to the brain

[Chorus: x2]

DJ Screw, mayne put a M down South
So I pay cost to be the boss, keep a time out in the crime house
We thoed we hold it down, wait for bidness no pleasure
This game is serious, ask M-J-G he'll tell you
Stay fired blowing big, sipping on a daily basis
I got better with my cheddar, I'm bout stacking my faces
It's the scrambling we gon handle em, living the best out our figgas
And if I'm lying we be draping choose my son, you tripping
When that Don from six, man I'm still a G to the N
I'm staying fly cause you smile, showing love to my kin
For shizzle my nizzle, from here McGregor we swang and bang
And in Peru hotting dudes, chopping by is from the fame
The girls best friend, princess cuts in everything
You know what's his name, and I take a half and a chain
This a down South patriot, and you know I won't stop
Tops drop trunks pop, and make em body rock

Break bread (where them ballers at)
Break bread-break bread (where them ballers at)
Break bread-break bread (where them ballers at)
Break bread-break bread

Break bread - 15x
[Hook - 2x]
You breaking bread, what's up with it
You breaking bread, what's up with it
I'm turning heads, when I enter the club
I'm Gucci this Fendi that, I'm all of the above

[Paul Wall]
When it comes to jewelry, I'm like T.J. Ford
Cause my diamonds, average bout 15 points
All my T.V. VS, nothing less than the best
So I guess, that means I got expensive breath
But I'm more than just jewelry, I'm more than just ice
But me looking like a scrub, just wouldn't safice
I got rolls gold glowing, lap tops showing
Bremie Louis the Thirteenth, to keep it flowing
I can keep going and going, but what's the use
You know I'm balling in the mix, cause I got the juice
I run with wise guys, so it's no surprise
Everywhere I go, women undress me with they eyes
Boys can't knock it, I'm on the rise like a rocket
Big bank take lil' bank, I let you pick which pocket
My wrist glowing, like I stuck my hand in a socket
It's Paul Wall can't nobody stop it, break bread

[Hook - 2x]
[Lew Hawk]
I'm a star stunning nigga, when I step in the club
Channel sets cross my wrist, just like a light bulb
Got Gucci cross my feet, while I shock and rock
Popping Crystal bottles, will make these hoes bop
We some top notch playas, ain't no time for acting
We need ATM machines, for the loot we stacking
Better think shoot a fee, I bet it won't break me
Plus I spend a few G's, up in VIP
It's the currency, that make these hoochies hunch
All they want is a hour fifty, take em out to lunch
But they must be drunk, I never trick off ends
Just flip a blue Benz, with the blue eyes lens
On 16 headed North, with my chrome girlfriend
She could make your life end, and not get sent to the Penn
This for my niggaz in the Penn, that won't see sunshine
Got princess cuts in my mouth, you could see sunshine, break bread

[Hook - 2x]
[Gu-U]
Jumping in the slab, I'm bound to turn heads
In something's blue red, running lights like the FED's
Man I feel like Pac, it's all eyes on me
Sitting on 23's, in the black SUV
A life of luxury, that's the life for me
You can catch me at the mall, spending 15 thee
On the piece and chain, got rocks and rings
Hoes attitudes changed, since I'm having thangs
It's hard to explain, but that's the way it goes
Over night I went from showing rocks, to rocking shows
Hoes that wouldn't speak, now they watching me
But I'm trying to figure out, is it the watch or me
Or the foreign car, with the blue eyed lens
It's a bird it's a plane, that's my made back Benz
Is we cutting or what, is what I'm asking her
In Texas she saw my chain, it's a massacre, break bread

With my 50 Cal. click, bang I'm gangsta walking with that trick aim 
My nuts hang, like D-boys on the corner 
And I could send a bitch nigga, a Bengal like Ty Warner 
I'm standing on a soap box, preaching the gospel 
On how you should move them coke rocks, and protect yo glocks 
And turn your projects, into Ft. Knox 
It just a fo' night, with two 44 glocks 

Now rise and shine it's a kick do', for your pies and pine 
I'm riding off in the sunset, the horizon's mine 
Everybody dies in time, but how will you pass 
In a million dollar mansion, or dead broke on your ass

I step into the club, in a fresh white T 
Looking for a one night wife, to delight me 
A lot of dudes claim, to be gangsta like Ice-T 
When in actuality, they sweeter than ice tea 
Get your weight up homie, only the strong survive 
Get off the bus and pay your dues, you don't belong on this ride 
I'm a full time playa, all about my hustle 
Demonstrating my muscle, if I get in a tussle 
If you got plex, I suggest you keep it hush-hush 
Cause boys wet up on that water, and you might get bust 
I got to stay up on my note, so my game is sharper 
I can't be wiped out, I'm like a permanent marker 
Boys mean mugging in the club, repping they hood 
It's understood but cross that line, homie it ain't good 
It's survival of the fittest, I'm the last one breathing 
While you in your bed sleeping, I'm still out here creeping

Take your ass to church nigga, if you wanna learn better 
Join Mase and Bethle-fuck him, I'm trying to get cheddar 
My stack will clearly show, my talent for moving blow 
And it's gangsta music, so fuck the status quote 
Grown men talking, who let the children in 
Get the nine to spit it in, leave him smelling like chit-lens 
I ain't playing I ain't joking, I'm rolling loaded and open 
It's best you not provoking, this man when he pistol toting 
The 4-fiftha, will tuck turn toss twist you 
Split you right down the middle, like a brand new swisha 
When the bullet hit you nigga, it rip and tear tissue 
Bullet bang, turn brains into baby batter 
Turn great matter, into antimatter 
Fuck your chitter-chatter, who's good better best badder 
Let the shotgun splitter splatter, who it hit child or bitch 
It don't matter, niggaz just handling bis' 
Primetime guerilla gang, get his what it is 

Last but not least, it's H.A. Dub 
Buckshot slugs, you covered in blood 
Feel me cuz, or get drug in the mud 
By these Texas thugs, who really don't show no love 

That's what it is nigga, handle your bis nigga 
This ain't your year nigga, I'll split your wig nigga 
Take a qwig nigga, this is the new South 
We coming hola, what you talking bout 
You niggaz still learning, we got they heads turning 
We got the streets burning, this is a street sermon

Try to understand, all the shit that I've been through
Try to understand, I got a life to live too
Try to understand, I got problems but I feel you
Try to understand, I'm a man I got bills too

[Pretty Todd]
I never give the devil the pleasure, to ever take a fella off of his level
Still, everything's right on schedule
I had my personal vendettas, but I solved em
Cause all that drama, could stop us from getting dollers
I take advice from one, and that's my mama
I made her a promise, my word is my honor
Cause sure enough, I'm a grown up
Just turned 21 there's money to get, and I'm trying to get me some
So get your ass out my path, 'fore you get mashed
Put a whole new career, in your new acts relapse
What we have, is organized grinding
In a mind of real niggas, our vision's a clear picture
I'm still with you, you ain't lost me I hope I ain't lost you
I just, had to get that out fool
And let niggas know, a lil' something about school
And struggle in this concrete, jungle I walk through

[Scooby]
I am dog, a grown man dog
You don't understand, the plan at hand dog
You see the potential, I mash to get cake
Hustle Presidential, like a Bad Azz Mix Tape
Say I live what I speak, so you best believe
I grind to what's left for me, is left in these streets
Listen up man, I mean with figgas
I don't know if it's just me, but all I see is green pictures
And I don't bother, with these in between niggas
Loyalty is my back bone, we the team nigga
G-are-I-T-be	-O
Why-doller sign, chump cause we need do'
Respect is power, and power is money
Money is time, money is the reason that I rhyme and grind
Might I remind you, that I'm designed to
Move anything out the way, of getting what's mine fool

[H.A.W.K.]
See the type of nigga I am, I give a good damn
Bout anything, other than fam
Just ten years ago, when I didn't have flow
Before You Already Know, when I didn't have do'
My mom's oldest seed, I had to take the lead
Dreams of making believe, became make believe
We was boys but we now men, ask once then you'll ask again
How many times, will I have to lend
You on the outside, looking in
You don't know where I done been, do anything to get in
I don't know how, some of you think
But soon as you blink, they here on the first and fifteenth
Now see I got bills too, feel me like you I feel you
God damn, I got a life too
Got a kid, and a wife too
And how the hell they goin' eat, if I still gotta feed you

[Lil' Keke]
Follow the vision, and we can walk the road clear
I hustled and struggled, it was another long year
I never had a brother, so I turned to the thugs
No unconditional love, cause we ain't the same blood
Tough guys, most why yall niggas still bluffing
I'm thinking while I'm puffing, I don't owe you niggas nothing
I'm changing my ways, I'm living my life new
Nigga get your own thing, and see what your hustle do
I done heard it all nigga, guess I'm chasing a dream
Got a big family to feed, and I'm the coach of that team
If you the shit best believe, all the flies they love it
When the plan going bad, everybody say fuck it
And you recognize game, when the pain is felt
And it's one thing for sure, I ain't goin' lie to myself
So you busta ass niggas, can't see night from day
Understand black man, I got bills to pay

And I'm lookin' out the window

I want to move west to where the sun is shining
I want my friends to all be there

Let's let the sunshine take us there

So tired but I'm not sleeping

That she sometimes calls her own

If I could press rewind
Turn on record and leave the past behind

Will you remind me

And movies made for cable 
And then we'll talk listenin' to punk rock

You get me so simply
But my heart won't let me

Hawk Nelson,"Every time I see you I can see right through you
Knowing I could never change your mind
I look into your eyes for the last time
I have realized for the first time

While everyone is around I'll take a moment
To let you know that I'm down

Have all my questions been ignored
This time I'm walking out the door

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angels cry
What you said to me late last night
I'll remember for the rest of my life
Every night when you close my eyes
I see the ways that you've touched my life
And I want you to know that I'll
Always be right here

Time stands still, so do I, leave me here
But for now I will go and I won't say nothing
Everytime I hear that sound it reminds me that
You're always hanging around

Have all my questions been ignored
This time I'm walking out the door

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angels cry
What you said to me late last night
I'll remember for the rest of my life
Every night when you close my eyes
I see the ways that you've touched my life
And I want you to know that I'll
Always be right here

These are the days these are the moments that pass us by
We ask the questions but we never really find out why

Pull my card right from the bottom
Reminds me of the things we've forgotten
That road trip we took back in autumn
That time we left and went back and got 'em

These are the days these are the moments that pass us by
We ask the questions but we never really find out why

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angels cry
What you said to me late last night

Feel the way that I feel now?
Cause from the window where I sometimes cry
I just want to see Your face tonight
And I'm willing to lose everything I am

Cause I need you more than ever
I need Your help to find where I've been going wrong so far

[Chorus]
Take me under Your wing tonight
Make me so perfect in Your eyes
Hold on cause it'll be alright
You're not alone anymore

When You're near me, I feel like I just found me
In the traces of the boy from yesterday
But in a world that is so black and white
I will take the steps to change my life
And I won't be coming back to here again

I need Your loving hand to guide me
Through the maze of all the things inside me
Then I'll know that I'm alright

Cause I need You more than ever
I need Your help to find where I've been going wrong so far

Tale me under Your wing tonight
Make me so perfect in Your eyes 
Hold on cause it will be alright
You're not alone 
Please help me get from worse to better
Before these tears soak through this lonely sweater
And let me know that I'm alright
I still have one strike of this match left
And I'm holding on to my last breath
And its getting a little dark around to see here

And You'll be here forever, forever You'll stay
And You promised to love me, You'll love me always
You'll love me for always, You'll love me for always

Every time I look into your eyes

Whenever you're around

You can find me hiding in the crowd

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

That all the way from here to Mexico

I get so nervous I'm feeling sick

I turn into the world's worst Romeo

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I love you like I always have before

Tell me what is beautiful
Is it anything like me

I love you yesterday

Where the honesty of fear
Makes a battle like a song
Falling on your ears

This is anger as beauty.

Fighter soul alive
In a whiskey fueled rage
The tears burn in your eyes
The saddest of the souls to save
Sings lovely in its fear
With a voice that's
Broken, strong

This is anger as beauty.

Lover don't you wait
Lover you'll be safe
The strangest quiet in the streets
Fighters for the love
Dug deep
They're under paved ports
Gently lifting up a song
Falling on your ears

Hawksley Workman,"You can tell by the wind
By fresh cut wood
All stacked to dry
That autumn's here
It makes you sad
About the crummy
Summer we had

With pine trees creaking
The raven's screeching
Just like the story my grandma tells
About when a bird
Hits your window
And someone you know
Is about to die

Autumn's here
It's OK if you want to cry
'Cause autumn's here

So find a sweater
And you'll be better
Until the kindling
Is tinder dry
We can be quiet
As we walk down
To see the graveyard
Where they are now
I wonder how
They brought their piano
To Haldane Hill
From Old Berlin
Be hard to keep it
It well in tune
With winters like the one
That's coming soon

'Cause autumn's here
Autumn's here
It's time to cry now
That autumn's here
And autumn's here
Autumn's here
It's OK if you want to cry
'Cause autumn's here

I think that ghosts like
The cooler weather
When leaves turn color
They get together
And walk along these
These old back roads
Where no one lives and
And no one goes
With all their hopes set
On the railway
That never came and
Then no one stayed
I guess that autumn
Gets you remembering
And the smallest things
Just make you cry

Whisper into my ear
Don't waste your breath
On anyone else

Let us wake up and talk a while
I tell you I'm scared
I tell you I'd fight for
Us both
But you come from the town
Where Gandhi was born
And you say I always talk tough
When I get drunk
So why don't we pray
Whispering the
Future language of slaves

I should rejoice
Maybe give voice to a song
For what brought me here to your arms
Into our painfully true love
And god maybe close
God only knows
Really to say.
And what would we do in our last moments
In time.
Would we make love
Or make haste to a mobile phone
Or would we break bread
Drink the blood that is shed
And pray to our god

We'd take the quiet roads beside
And park along the cornfield

Lock the city down
And the riot police gather all around

And we practically fantasized
About the downfall of a city
About the downfall of a country
About the downfall of a lifetime

Don't want to hurt anything

Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

The leaves are heavy around your feet you hear the thunder of the train

Hawkwind,"In case of sonic attack on your district, follow these rules
If you are making love it is imperative
To bring all bodies to orgasm simultaneously

Do not waste time blocking your ears
Do not waste time seeking a sound proofed shelter
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible

Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic
Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic

Use your wheels it is what they are for
Do not attempt to use your own limbs
Small babies should be placed inside the special cocoons
And should be left, if possible, in shelters

If no wheels are available metal, metal, metal, metal
Metal, metal, metal, metal
Not organic limbs should be employed whenever practical

Remember, remember, remember, remember
In the case of sonic attack survival means
Every man for himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself
Statistically more people survive if they think
Only of themselves, only of themselves, only of themselves

Do not attempt to rescue friends, relatives, loved ones
You have only a few seconds to escape
Use those seconds sensibly or you will inevitably die

Do not panic, do not panic
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself

These are the first signs of sonic attack
You will notice small objects such as ornaments oscillating
You will notice [Inaudible]
You will hear a distant hissing in your ears

You will feel dizzy, you will feel the need to vomit
[Inaudible]
[Inaudible]

[Inaudible]
[Inaudible]
You may be subject to fits of hysterical shouting or even laughter

These are all sign of imminent sonic destruction
Your only protection is flight
If you are less than ten years old
Remain in your shelter and use your cocoon

If I remember you can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

Hawkwind,"I would rather the fire storms of atmospheres
Than this cruel descent from a thousand years
Of dreams, into the starkness of the capsule.

Where two of our crew still lay suspended cool
In their tombs of sleep.

Those nagging choirs of memory
The tubes and wires
Worming from their flesh to machinery
I would have to cut
Such midwifery is but one function of the leader here

Floating in a sac of fluid dark
A clear century of space
Away from Earth
While one man stares from the trauma of his birth
Attending to the hypno-tapes
Assuring him
That this was reality
However grim

Our journey's end
Landing itself was nothing
We touched upon a shelf of rock
Selected by the auto-mind
And left a galaxy of dreams behind",The Awakening,1973

Space is neutral, it is cold
Stars occupy minute areas of space

Space does not comfort
It does not speak, it does not wake
It does not dream

It does not know, it does not fear
It does not love, it does not hate
It does not encourage any of these qualities
Space cannot be measured, it cannot be
Angered, it cannot be placated
It cannot be summed up, space is there
Space is not large and it is not small
It does not live and it does not die
It does not offer truth and neither does it lie
Space is a remorseless, senseless, impersonal fact
Space is the absence of time and of matter",Black Corridor,1973

Hawkwind,"Nine to five or ten to six, up to the city and back to the sticks
You've got to unwind your mind, you've got to unwind your mind
Sit back, switch on, your face has got a twitch on
Your fuses are blown out in a double bind
Air-conditioned, psycho-analyzed, you're very nearly human
You're so well disguised
Robot, robot, you're a robot, robot
You're warm when it's cold, you're cool when it's hot
Your life is recorded on a micro-dot, robot, robot
You'd hold the whole world in your metal claws
If it wasn't for the three laws of robotics
Automated homunculus, you queue for the paper
You queue for the bus, you're a ""good morning"" machine
You're a ""how are you?"" device

Sit there fuming until your face goes green
Air conditioned, and desensitized, you're very nearly human

The liquid golden fires glare
My loping walk, my slinking spine
Are signs that there is something there
The way my nostrils flare for odors
The way my ears prick up for sound
My hair's electrically aware
Tells me things for miles around
I am a man-wolf, I am a wolf man
I have half a canine mind
I have half the mind of man
I am neither of one kind
Maybe it was only an hallucination
I'm no stranger to such things

To my jaded imagination

My languishing alone in my lair
Where you will never hear me laughing
I'm half in love with dark and despair

Quicksilver quivering in the sky
It echoes like a cave of chromium
That'll vacuum up my soul when I die
I am a wolf man, I am a man-wolf

A freak, a fiend, a figment of mind
A species of the steppes and city

I am neither of one kind
Dissolving in the slender of this desolation

Exactly a description of my isolation
I made a note of it in my log
To the secret of all creation
I follow my own trail like a dog

I am a wolf man who walks alone in the gas lamp
Shadows of the streets at night
I am a man-wolf upright on two feet in the
City dressed somberly as a man
I am a wolf man under skies heavy with snow
My eyes are convex lenses of ebony embedded
In amber
I am a man-wolf
The fat bourgeois and his dapple ganger
Are buried in their solid glare
Twin specimens of insect set for display
I am a man-wolf, the man in me would kill the wolf
I am a wolf man, the wolf in me would eat the man
I am a wolf man, who despises the striving of common men
Who sees them at work, at their daily tasks
At factories and office desk
Who watches them at evening, elbows lift at tavern tables,
Heads lolling in song

I saw a neon sign reflected in a pool of liquid sky
It was not what I expected I was only walking by
The sign said ""to the magic theater""

It is but for madmen only, the first performance has begun
I looked up to see that notice where the lights were
Shining from
Nothing but blank wall was there

If you are making love it is imperative
To bring all bodies to orgasm simultaneously

Do not waste time blocking your ears
Do not waste time seeking a sound proofed shelter
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible

Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic
Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic

Do not attempt to use your own limbs
Small babies should be placed inside the special cocoons
And should be left, if possible, in shelters

If no wheels are available metal, metal, metal, metal
Metal, metal, metal, metal
Not organic limbs should be employed whenever practical

Remember, remember, remember, remember
In the case of sonic attack survival means
Every man for himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself
Statistically more people survive if they think
Only of themselves, only of themselves, only of themselves

Do not attempt to rescue friends, relatives, loved ones
You have only a few seconds to escape
Use those seconds sensibly or you will inevitably die

Do not panic, do not panic
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself

These are the first signs of sonic attack
You will notice small objects such as ornaments oscillating
You will notice [Inaudible]
You will hear a distant hissing in your ears

You will feel dizzy, you will feel the need to vomit

Hawkwind,"News had drifted on the wind of many minds that this was to be an
Occasion of great importance. For it was said by some that Earth City
Had somehow uncovered a single time sleeper from the time before

Although the cryptic writings upon his tomb were now faded beyond
Decipherable reading, it was said, by the disembodied members of the
Ruling kind, that the entombed was from that time on Earth before the
City stretched its metal web from pole to pole leaving green things only
In the wells of immortal minds

Upon the third revolution after its arrival, the tomb that slept without
Life was removed for inspection. The day was programmed for a clear dome
Above, with a mild breeze wafting from the central weather post, below
Throngs of class three occupants were gathering from various sectors to
Observe the opening, as per standard procedure, their data input
Stations were fed appropriate propaganda so that their reports would
Coincide with what the rulers had predetermined

And so it was upon that day of opening, his spirit did appear and confuse
Once again. It was evident to all that what lay within was not of mortal
Composure. Thoughts emanating from deep within its dimensionless cave
Conveyed this belief to all within the medi-dome.

What is this apparition now amongst our kind?

Quickly thereafter, all pressure was released from within the stillness.
Earth City, unknowingly at that time, was about to enter a new phase of
Its existence

Violent quaking began to shake the towers of sector 63, manifestations
Of melting speed its wings over the structure until once again, ancient

I think that what I'm getting is a warning
Messages are scrambled but they're urgent
Something in the cortex 'bout detergent

I think it's coming clearer
I can see it in the mirror
Heading for a relapse
Clogging up the synapse
Or is it just Cassandra yawning?

Killers in the streets are wearing striped pants
They are interfering with my larynx
My brother and my sister joined the army
They promise that they do not mean to harm me

Messages messages Persecution Persecution messages messages.....

Now it's growing dimmer
I can see the mirror shimmer
Sounds are getting stranger
Warning me of danger
Or can it be that I am merely tired?

There's a roaring in my ears that will not die
And signals in the sky I can't identify
My eyes are melting and my lips are moving
And the words that I am hearing are not soothing

Breathing's getting harder
There's nothing in the larder
The building's falling over
Or the Sun is going nova
Or is it my old-fashioned paranioa?

I think that it's important information
Giving me my future destination
Fragments of mysterious conversation
Lend the game a frightening complication

I know they're trying to tell me
What can they want to sell me?
The floor is undulating
My bones are soft and aching
Or have I temporarily lost my bearing?

Every little sound is charged with meaning
Percentage bandits riding out of ealing
Stuttering, shouting, crying, and declaiming
Sentences are waxing, now they're waning
I'm nearly out of letters
From my elders and my betters
The Killer's moving faster
He tells me that he's my master
Or was he just asking me ""the time please?""

Daemon of darkness, brother to the night
Jack of Shadows, what's he hanging out for?
King of the dimensions, the other side of light

And when he passes
He casts shades of mystery black
Flowing like molasses
It's only Jack of Shadows on his way back
To the kindom of thieves
Before the skies crack

Jack of Shadows, cloak of constellations
Draped around his body, blanking out his face
Jack of Shadows, don't believe in God, he
Steals from the future, fades without a trace

And when the flames flare
Flickering forms of velvet dark
He plays his games there
It's only Jack of Shadows, he's lit up by a spark
To run into the umbra , as fast as a shark

Jack of Shadows, ultravoilet eyesight
Giving him the vision that cats-eye infrared
Jack of Shadows, watch him as he flies right
Through all of the umbras, quicker than the dead

And when he passes
He casts shades of mystery black
Flowing like molasses
It's only Jack of Shadows on his way back
To the kindom of thieves
Before the skies crack

Jack of Shadows, Jack of Shadows
Jack of Shadows, Jack of Shadows
Jack of Shadows, Jack of Shadows.......

It's all a figment of my mind
In a world that I've designed
I'm charged with cosmic energy
Has the world gone mad or is it me?

I'm the creator of this universe
And all that is was meant to be
So that we might learn to see
The foolishness that lives in us
And stupidity that we must suss
How to banish from our minds

And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my
Return to earth
But your father refused to sign the forms to freeze you

By the time I return to earth
My time held dreams were full of you as you were
When I left, still underage
Your android replica is playing up again
It's no joke
When she comes she moans another's name
But that's the spirit of the age, that's the
Spirit of the age
I am a clone, I am not alone
Every fiber of my flesh and bone is identical to
The others
Everything I say is in the same tone as my test
Tube brother's voice
And there's no choice between us, if you had ever
Seen us you'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness something special of
Your own
Being a clone I have no flaws to identify
Even this doggerel that pours from my pen
Has just been written by another twenty
Telepathic men
Word for word it says
""Oh, for the wings of any bird other than a
Battery hen""

Hawkwind,"On board the craft, I noticed a lot of electrical-like ceiling lines, like the lines in the human brain. There are windows or screen areas all around the ship. They're like a two-way mirror - a kind of projection place. It is as if these window screens are made of a combination of metal, crystal, or mirrored glass.

I see a cloudscape or landscape on suspended plastic sheets. I notice slanted surfaces on the tops of machines with instruments on panels. Small creatures are busily moving around. They are seated at the controls at the base of the slanted walls. Robot-like creatures, with large black eyes that appear to have reptilian and insectile facial qualities. 

I don't have any problem facing the little ones that are so blissful, but the ugly ones scare and repulse me. It's like the larvae inside the leather faced skin of a hard dark scary machine. The reptile-faced insect bodied robots, they are being brought forth to perform specific functions...

The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme
And it's high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please wake me 

Butterfly with broken wings has falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in there's nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home
And it's high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please wake me 

The lines converging where you stand they must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet you hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing sides

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

Is this a voice or just a panic attack?
I need a doctor to help me try to relax 
No one ever told me I was living too fast

I thought that I should tell you
My world is crashing down again

I'm spinning round
Calling out
I'm falling down
I'm spinning round
Calling out
I'm falling, I'm falling
I don't care, 
I don't care what you think of me right now
'Cause I'm gonna have a break down

You know me all too well
But you never had the chance
To find out who I really am
Who I really am

You know me all too well
But you never had the chance
To find out who I really am

Hawthorne Heights,"Over and over, you keep singing the same old song
I used to be stronger, the silence is longer
Now I'm the bitter one
I've made mistakes, and I'll take it all back

I feel, I feel so typical
Just another ghost from so so long ago
Another faint reminder
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Or should I just let go
I'm just another ghost

Again and again, I keep having the same nightmare
I used to be younger, I'm losing the hunger
I'm not having any fun
I've made mistakes and I'll take it all back

I feel, I feel so typical
Just another ghost from so so long ago
Another faint reminder
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Or should I just let go
I'm just another ghost

All of these fractures are killing the passion
Weighed down by anchors of negativity

Just another ghost, just another ghost

I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
Just another ghost, just another ghost
I still need you, do you need me
Can you see right through me now
I still need you, I still need you, I still need you
Just another ghost

I feel, I feel so typical
Just another ghost from so so long ago

Hawthorne String Quartet,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Dans nos barios la monnaie n'enfante pas l'homme
Je chante la mélancolie de ma vida loca
La chica vêtue de Gucci mucho calor
Hola belle inconnue dansons la salsa portoricana
Brûlé par les feux de la passion jusqu'à l'aube
Avant qu'la policia ne me jette au mitard
J'entend résonner la voix de mon loko Soprano
J'ai cherché le bonheur au fond d'un champ de marijuana

Voilà les armes lourdes, mes locos démarrent (""Rum!"")
Et ça défouraille (""Rum! Rum! Rum"")
Mais les gyrophares tournent, mes locos se barrent (""Rum!"")
Sous le bruit des balles (""Rum! Rum! Rum!"")
Le bario n'oublie rien mais il a pardonné
Nos mamas sont des lionnes elles valent de l'or niño

Accompagné d'Amel en train d'chanter Jean-Jacques Goldmann
Tu t'es dit Sopram'Baba a tourné la veste
Ça m'étonne pas de toi ce discours de débile mental
Le bario c'est dans le sang, dans l'attitude, dans le vécu, dans le sourire
Les larmes dans les habitudes, dans l'âme, dans la nourriture
La zob' dans la solitude, le silence de ce qu'on a vu
Les rompopopompompom criés sous la lune
Dis toi que je chante le bario depuis mes 12 piges et ça ça ne changera pas
L'amour que j'ai pour ces favelas sera toujours en moi jusqu'à c'qu'on m'enterrera
Juste le fait d'en parler me fait remonter l'odeur du bon mafé d'la voisine
Ceux qu'ont taffés à l'usine squattent le café et nous disent d'aller prier

Chapitre 1
Tout commence dans le XV Barbar
Avec Dis et Ino, jeunes et fous nous étions
Sur une pluie des plus battantes, au coeur du boulevard
Sans vergogne, des coups d'cross et de coudes nous mettions
Mon métier c'est la rue, salarié depuis bambin
Envie de porter du Zilli, du Lanvin
Carpe diem, on veut des lovés sans lendemain
Demain c'est loinguin
Ours polaire d'la banquise, vi-ser les pingouins
Elle sait que je fais du blégué, elle veut mon painguain
Regarde-moi bienguin
Demande au frère Lum', je t'allume, tu t'éteingueins
Bitch, pour toi l'amour n'est qu'un chiffre
Snitch, pour toi l'honneur n'est qu'un mot
Avec ou sans shit les mots fusent dans ma tête au rythme du piano
J'suis mineur, j'fais des liasses
Avec Niaks, Mbi, Papada, Kamel et Nass
Y'a pas d'heure pour brasser, y'a pas d'âge pour les bracelets
Rusé mais hélas, pris dans la mêlasse, la juge nous menace
Y'a pas d'heure pour brasser, y'a pas d'âge pour les bracelets
Rusé mais hélas
Weed et cocaïne, j'voulais des filles coquettes
Insolent, j'fais trembler les murs de ta ville en compèt
Loin des cocktails, je voulais brûler le top ten
J'dérangeais les rageux, j'n'avais peur de sonne-per
J'parlais du game comme si j'étais son père
J'ai pas attendu l'rap pour sabrer le Dom Pér'
Soulever des bastos, piétiner Harkos
Guidonner des gamos, fonce-dé sur le corner
Dans la rue, j'ai vécu
J'ai vécu, j'ai dû apprendre et rendre des coups
La Batmobile au cul
J'ai failli, j'ai échoué, pas toujours pris des sous
Esclave du capitalisme
À l'affût de Tom Ford, de toutes formes de confort
La Faucheuse t'a sur sa liste
Et ton cercueil est trop petit pour ton coffre-fort
Polyglote armé d'un B4, de C4
Pour mes frères au D4
Vas-y tire si t'es cap
N'oublie pas que mes erreurs sont le reflet d'mes actes
J'suis filoch' par les RG
Mon oseille, j'suis allé le chercher
Tu voulais produire qui? T'es barjot
J'suis pas ta poule aux œufs d'Faberger
Bienvenue dans ma dynastie
M'en voulez pas si j'ai trop d'inspi
De le-sty, trop deuspi, les has been se rassirent
Moi? Dans 10 piges on m'appellera ""Sir""
Toi? Tu m'observes d'un air oisif, d'un air oisif

Maintenant elles me veulent toutes hashtag #RochVoisine

Sixty chargé contre les obliques
J'fume la verte avec parcimonie
Par ici la monnaie, magnum pour mes homies
Ignorance pour les médisants
J'me dois d'être le rappeur le plus puissant
Sache qu'à mes 10 ans j'me l'suis promis
Elle me tire dans la chambre par le chibre
Si je vends plus, ces salopes me tchipent
Mais j'tiens plus que la Muraille de Chine
Ils ont du pétrole, j'ai du gaz de schiste
Lyriciste hyperactif, ils disent que j'love la coco
Que j'ai des phases d'autiste

On tire sur poucaves, mauvais payeurs
Rappeurs, usurpateurs et flutistes
Le procureur nous prive des meilleurs, j'pense à Ulysse D5 cellule 10
On regrette jadis, le monde part en couilles
Les hommes veulent une chatte, les femmes un pénis
La prochaine étape
Ils emmènent nos gosses en vacances scolaires sur des plages nudistes
J'ai toujours la barre à l'enterrement d'un flic
Ils ont mis 2 piges à Sango pour une 10
Voilà mon 17, j'encule la jet set
Je reste ghetto, même quand j'baise une actrice
Rentre dans la matrice, naissance en Afrique
J'ai vu toute ma population stagner
J'ai toujours le seum, Marianne sur nos sols

Si le rap ne payait pas, je sais pas où j'aurais pu atterrir
Poussière de génie, j'l'ai fais tout seul, j'le mérite
Mais je n'emporterai rien, vu qu'un jour ou l'autre on va périr
Peut-être qu'on n'est pas né sous la même étoile
Si tu divises pour mieux régner, tes araignées changent de toile
Oui peut-être, si y'avait pas ces groupies à poil dans ma chambre
Je serai marié, j’emmènerais mes gosses à la voile
Oui peut-être, que cet été je passerais par Hawaï
Que j'ai percé sans avoir le timbre de voix de Balavoine
Oui peut-être que je vis, peut-être que rêve et peut-être que je vis mon rêve alors je mets les voiles

Peut-être que j'aurais du partir
Peut-être que j'aurais du faire autre chose

Tard la nuit j'réfléchis, j'réfléchis, j'me ballade seul sur Paris
J'prends tout à contre-courant, donc comment donner un sens à ma vie
Peut-être que je ne suis pas fait, pas fait pour rouler en Maserati
J'ai plus de faits que de vécu, dis-moi la morale tu la fais à qui
Et j'me suis noyé dans les problèmes, mon cœur se remplit j'en perds des collègues
Ouais ma fierté remplace ma colère, énervé depuis les années collège
Que Dieu nous montre le droit chemin ou qu'il m'éloigne de ces gens malsains
Oui, qu'il m'éloigne de ces gens malsains
Les soucis s’empilent une fois que t'en caches un

Haydée Milanés,"Te presentí como cuando llegan los vientos de tormenta
tu senda gris me ha despertado el alma
y hoy me atormenta

Llegaste con tu cinta, amarrando en tu cabeza
todo el viejo pasado que moría
y tus ojos color de esperanza me dijeron
que sufrías, que ya no esperabas ni un consuelo

Y de pronto el pasado reciente retornó
y no quise llenarme el pecho de ternura
porque tengo temor, porque siento el dolor
que tu amor me causaría
Yo no quiero sufrir, yo prefiero morir
a saber que sufriría

Te presentí como cuando llegan los vientos de tormenta
tu senda gris me ha despertado el alma
y hoy me atormenta",El 405 de nunca,2017
Haydée Milanés,"No te pido que te cuides
Esa delgadez extrema
Sólo pido que me mires
Con esa mirada buena

Tus ojos no son luceros
Que alumbran la madrugada
Pero si me miran siento
Que me tocas con tus manos

Tus manos no son hermosas
No veo estilo en tus dedos
Pero qué humanos reposan
Si se enroscan en tu pelo

Tu pelo ya sin color
Sin ese brillo supremo
Cuida y resguarda con celo
Lo que cubre con amor

Tu cerebro porque piensas
Porque es tu clave y motor
Va generando la fuerza
Que me hace humano y mejor

Cuerpo, manos, ojos, pelo
Carne y hueso inanimados
Que cobran vida
Y por eso quiero vivir a tu lado",Amor,2017
Haydée Milanés,"Todavía quedan restos de humedad
Sus olores llenan ya mi soledad
En la cama su silueta 
Se dibuja cual promesa 
De llenar el breve espacio 
En que no está

Todavía yo no sé si volverá
Nadie sabe, al día siguiente, lo que hará
Rompe todos mis esquemas
No confiesa ni una pena
No me pide nada a cambio de lo que da

Suele ser violenta y tierna
No habla de uniones eternas
Mas se entrega cual si hubiera 
Sólo un día para amar
No comparte una reunión
Mas le gusta la canción 
Que comprometa su pensar

Todavía no pregunte «¿te quedarás?»
Temo mucho a la respuesta de un «jamás»
La prefiero compartida 
Antes que vaciar mi vida
No es perfecta, mas se acerca 
A lo que yo simplemente soñé

Suele ser violenta y tierna
No habla de uniones eternas
Mas se entrega cual si hubiera

Y tenía un rostro ajeno al que yo amaba

Y tenía un rostro ajeno al que yo amaba 
El que dan unos años de no ser feliz

Junto a ti
Mi futuro de sueños llené
Logré identificar tu belleza 
Y el mundo al revés 
Nos miraban de muy buena fe
Nada cruel existía, si yo te veía, reía después

Desperté la mañana en que no pudo ser
No sin antes jurar que si no era contigo, jamás
Que esta herida me habría de matar

Pude recordar

Que la distancia más larga 
Y yo sé que aún te quiero 
Y que mis manos te aguardan
Y qué hacer, si no hacer como que vivo

Mi calle nunca termina
Y tu voz y tu figura 
Sobre mi espalda caminan

Paso a paso voy pensando 
Todo lo que fuimos juntos 
Y hoy contemplo con tristeza 
Lo solo que está mi mundo
Paso a paso el delirio se acrecienta

Todo se rompe en pedazos 
Y de pronto surges tú 
Que me llevas en tus brazos

Haydée Milanés,"Muchas veces te dije que antes de hacerlo 
Había que pensarlo muy bien
Que a esta unión de nosotros 
Le hacía falta carne y deseo también

Que no bastaba que me entendieras 
Y que murieras por mí
Que no bastaba que en mi fracaso 
Yo me refugiara en ti

Y ahora ves lo que pasó 
Al fin nació, al pasar de los años
El tremendo cansancio que provoco ya en ti
Y aunque es penoso lo tienes que decir

Por mi parte esperaba 
Que un día el tiempo se hiciera cargo del fin
Si así no hubiera sido 
Yo habría seguido jugando a hacerte feliz

Y aunque el llanto es amargo piensa en los años 
Que tienes para vivir
Que mi dolor no es menos y lo peor 
Es que ya no puedo sentir

Con vano afán este tiempo perdido 
Que nos deja vencidos sin poder conocer

Haydée Milanés,"El recital va terminando 
Ya va cayéndose el telón 
Un fuerte aplauso va cerrando 
El final de una canción

Ya se repone el corazón 
Son menos fuertes los dolores 
Va pasando la emoción

Afuera la gente clama por entrar
Te espera una noche de éxitos y amor
Se produjo el encuentro de cada noche 
En que lo humano se va a morir 
Y en su lugar se queda un fantoche 
Que es bien amable y hace reir
Quién será el que pregunte por esos besos 
Que un ser pequeño te dió al partir
Quién por tu árbol, por todo eso 
Que día a día te hace vivir

La cama solitaria y fría 
Como un objeto confesor
Oye un resumen cada día 
De lo que nunca pasó
Ya se aproxima la mañana

Todo ese cuerpo se prepara 
Para dar lo mejor

Te espera otra noche de éxitos y amor",Te espera una noche de éxitos,2017
Haydée Milanés,"A veces cuando el sol levanta el vuelo 
remuevo la esperanza y miro adentro 
y entre mi corazón y la añoranza 
sólo dormita un charco de aguacero

Detrás de la mirada salta un sueño 
que sin querer se agita en la garganta 
una carrera ciega hasta tu cuello 
un tropiezo que rompe la balanza

No habrá razón que guarda el equilibrio 
cuando la ausencia llora en los sentidos 
cuando la soledad es un gran pino 
que crece en un jardín de blancos lirios

No habrá más que gritar contra el silencio 
cuando me invade el pecho la llovizna 
y aunque tu luz no fuera ya la misma 
y me quede de pie donde aún te espero

A veces cuando el mar nos alcanza 
y tan sólo el rocío moja el suelo 
un pájaro veloz recorre el cielo 
y crece con el tiempo la distancia
y crece, con el tiempo la distancia

Choked to death
Was because they get up
And walk away
Right when they feel
Their throats give way
They leave the table
To avoid a scene
So no one hears them
And no one sees
And I just realized
That if you
Started Choking
I wouldn't know 
What to do",Choking,1997
Hayden,"I don't know if that's your leg, or is it mine?
We're entwined.
And I can't tell if it's day or night outside,
I closed the blinds.
And I feel so good inside,
When you come into my mind.
I can't wait till you come home,
And your skin will replace
The phone.
I don't know, is that your eyelash or mine?
I think it's mine.
And tell me about the night we slept
Outside.
When you had to leave
Decide
Whether we should even try
By a burned-out streetlight
In the middle of July.",Middle of July,1997
Hayden,"Remember the day
We went to an old fashioned way
To get my haircut
By an old fashioned barber,
He sat me on his chair,
Sharpened his blades and cut my hair. 

I asked him if he'd shave my beard,
He said he stopped doing that last year.
Tradition ends in fear.

we walked down the road
New haircut, feeling good I know,
Things will get better,
Summer is right around the corner.

I stopped and looked into your eyes,
Somedays I'm depressed
Don't know why.
Today I'm glad
To be alive.",Old Fashioned Way,1997
Hayden,"There's a couple up the stairs
Making noise all the time.

Then I call the cops, or chicken out.

We've been sick for a days and were stuck inside

Hayden,"With your summer hat and smile
You came here to leave there
And as the sun stained your legs and your arms
The men arrive with their one-track minds
You like that they're there when they ask you the time
They say what they do, and they'll do what you say
And they'll tell you some lies if you let them . . . stay

And you laugh, but not too hard
And you look, but not too far
Your eyes drift across the beach
And just before you reach me, he speaks
His face is red, and he's talking to breeze
You get up to leave as the sun hits the trees
And you jump in the water with him at . . . your feet

And I laugh, but not too hard
And I look, but not too far",The Hazards of Sitting Beneath Palm Trees,1998

Flashing lights and sirens rang

When we argued about the car

I want you to know
That I am so
Thankful that you're here

How come everything has to change?
I wish were 4 and 6 and in the rain
When we were 6 and 8 we dressed the same

A bit selfish I should be if I could change I would. 

See it on my face! 
All I wanted was a friend to look in me to comprehend. 
All I wanted was to fly how could you sit and watch me die? 
All I wanted was you there your cruelty was my despair. 

You just killed me so the story goes. 
Once upon a time there was a girl who loved me more than life itself. 
By the duck pond she said, 
Carved our names into the bark we climbed the tree. 

I slipped and fell behind,

All reminds me of your name we sought fortune through the rain. 
Every day and every place everywhere I kissed your face. 
All the sacrifice in vain how could you put all the blame on me? 
That's not fair so the story goes. 

Once upon a time we had the moon we had the stars we were divine. 
Upon my shoulder she cried. 
Now she hides the faith she fears she throws herself. 
Before her bed of lies. 

She'll be sorry.

I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me ""friend""

I'm fin ta Crip walk and put some motherfucking khakis on
No that's alright man I ain't got nothin' to prove
I'm rich but I still live like I got nothin' to lose
Look man, I don't know what you been drinkin' I don't know what you been thinkin'
But get outta line and it's oops upside ya head
The media they write whatever they choose
And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news
These other rap niggas couldn't walk in my shoes
Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was paying my dues
They say my music make a gangsta want to pop somethin'
Well tell them niggas to get poppin' & stop frontin'
You heard of me but do you know how I get down
Stay with a vest on, roll wit a couple tre-pounds
In case you motherfuckers want to jump bad now
I'll start some bullshit and I'm a lay ya punk ass down

I make rap niggas disappear like Lil Zane
See Buck been shot, but not more than 50
I don't dance, what I look like signin' wit Diddy?
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit wit me
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin'
What's in my hand? A tan 'bout a hundred and sixty
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip
Crips and Bloods they show me love like I'm claimin' a set
These industry niggas know they better pay me my check
I get a kick outta seein' these broke ass rappers
Ten people showed up that's why your show got canceled
50 whatever they did to the kid is handled
Niggas callin' for these features but they get no answers
Fuck y'all niggas

So we can spread your feet, and have you on your boulevard Walkin'
The birds keep hawkin', why?

I laugh at a snotty chick, bitch I don't argue
I'll leave a print in your ass from a karate kick

You can’t deceive me silly child, silly child
I don’t believe that pretty smile, pretty smile

Like the time we drove to the OC
Got so lost we thought we would never get home
You know the night when I gave my heart to you
And you swore that you felt the same too
You said that you would never ever leave me alone

Out of nowhere you were gone
Into someone else's arms
Should have known that she was more
Than just a friend, all the things I never knew
But I always trusted you
Never thought that she would wind up in the end
Your new girlfriend (your new girlfriend)

I believe what goes around comes around
So stay out of the deep end or you'll both drown
Even shallow water is over her head
You broke my heart but baby hey life goes on
Everything is down for a reason
Now I can see for me there's something better ahead

Get this far, 'cause now that I see who you really are
You can have a new girlfriend

Than just a friend, deep inside I think I knew

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Haydn Quartet,"There's a time each year
That we always hold dear
Good old summertime
With the birds and the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes
Good old summertime
When your day's work is over
Then you are in clover
And life is one beautiful rhyme
No trouble annoying
Each one is enjoying
The good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime
Strolling through a shady lane
With your baby mine
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsey-wootsey
In the good, old summertime

Oh, to swim in the pool
You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""
With Jim, Kate and Josie
Good old summertime
Those days full of pleasure
We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries
In good old summertime

In the good old summertime
In the good old summertime

Haydon,"Never needed a hand nope, I did it all alone
With no dad to make a man of me, I did it on my own
A victim, a condition now I'm conditioned for the cold
Even though I know what's missing there's no feeling in this home
Escaped it, a whole leap of problems, isolating instead of facing
I always attract the women who think that I need saving
Even though I'm the only person I can put any faith in
Face it, I'm chained in and happily so,
What would I have to hold it if I let all the anarchy go?
Can't take the praise, I just climb my patrol,
Just know I better deal with hatred and handle it so

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
And I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
(Who's gonna) Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

See what I got in this world?
That's how come I can't sleep without poppin a pill
Felt it come back up but I'm still down,
Just back to convincing myself that I'm ill now
See with me the stress manifest isn't it,
Still in me is this ray of happiness and its killing me
I cant control it yet I worry about things that are out of my control and I'm folded
I ain't never letting this introvert out,
In a lonely home that could have been but isn't our house
But I ain't in the mood to have any visitors round
So I hide away, my curtains been drawn so long
I couldn't tell you if its night or day
So how I feel is the only way that I can hide the pain
People try and help but I shy away but a problem shared is a problem heard
But I care for you too much to make this problem ours
Who knows where this problem starts
Come on Steve and get to mine,
You're not scared it's something I'm man enough to be
Or even you get be, how am I meant to handle what I see
When they just found my daddy hanging from a tree

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

Trying to find myself
I don't know where to go from here
Losing my strength
So save me again

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

So save me again

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling

Hayes Carll,"My first hangout when I moved to Galveston was the Old Quarter Cafe. 
It's the best bar ever, except they don't have liquor, food, or customers. 
So, in between sets I went across the street to drink whiskey, eat peanuts, and stare at the cigarette machine.

I'm tired of drinkin' whiskey by myself
I'm tired of drinkin' whiskey by myself
I wish you'd take that bottle
And put it right back on the shelf
Cause I'm tired of drinkin' whiskey by myself

I go down to the bar most every night
I go down to the bar most every night
The girls don't even notice and the boys all want to fight
But I go down to the bar most every night

The jukebox has not played my song in years
The jukebox has not played my song in years
On this same old barstool just backin' shots with beers
And the jukebox has not played my song in years

All my friends have gone so far away
Said all my friends have gone so far away
They all moved down to Austin
Lord I miss 'em night and day
And all my friends have gone so far away

I'm really not that funny anymore
I'm really not that funny anymore
I used to be a riot, now I just a lonely bore
And I'm really not that funny anymore

Do you think that I could stay in town with you
Do you think that I could stay in town with you
It's thirty miles to my place and I'm feelin' tired and blue

Hayes Carll,"Well I hide behind my guitar like a sparrow in the night
Hopin' I might fly away anew
Cause they'll love you when you're wrong
And then leave you when you're right
Tell me baby, what's a boy to do?

Well I came to town a stranger, not knowin' how to act
Figured I'd hang out and just get found.
Made me some new friends
They climbed way up on my back
Been gone so long they ain't comin' down

You can kiss the sky good morning
You can say your prayers at night
Hide your soul way down in your shoes,
But it's the same old scene
Borrowed love and faded dreams
And you just can't hide from those Arkansas blues.

Well time is playin' tricks on me
Makes me thing I'm movin' fast
I don't think I'm movin' at all
And every stranger's face I see reminds me of the past
Come on big and leave you feelin' small

So I took to drinkin' liquor on the other side of town
Way up in those woods beside the moon
Where every graceful dream I had got lost without a sound
Tell you what, I can't leave this place too soon.

And it don't take no rhyme or reason
It don't make no sense at all
Just one of those things that you don't choose
It's the same old thing
Broken hearts and busted strings
And you just can't run from those Arkansas blues.

Everybody's asking questions about whose side are you on
I don't see how it matters much to me
And all these midnight celebrations
That are ended by the dawn
Leave you feelin' low as you can be

So I'm leaving town this morning, gonna lighten up my load
See if I can't lose what I have found
And it's one drink for the memories
And one kiss for the road
Look out, I believe I'm Texas bound
California, Oklahoma, Arizona, Tennessee
I been all around this land to pay my dues
High, low, and right behind me
Wherever I go they find me
And I just can't run from the Arkansas blues.",Arkansas Blues,2002
Hayes Carll,"Jamie was a barmaid at the Underground Longrail
Seems like every Friday evenin'
She'd find herself in Jail
Not a friend this side of Houston
With the time to throw her bail
But she'll be fine, she'll be fine

Spent a lifetime walkin'
Through the walls of a broken home
Not a man round here still standin'
For the girl to call her own.
Every time she tried to hold him
She just ended up alone
But there's still time, there's still time

Davey drove a taxi
Through the streets of Boston town
Like the billboards up above him
The world just wore him down
Only soul he'd ever cared for
Was the one he'd never found
But He'll be fine, He'll be fine

Broken half of winter, with a wind chill ten below
Davey sittin' in his kitchen laughin 'bout
How the world had done him so
Then the postman burst his bubble
With a letter from below
And now it's time, now it's time

[Chorus]
And there's a lot of people runnin' round
Not quite sure which way to go
But as for me I believe I finally found
It's just easy come and easy go

Jamie grabbed a bottle, threw her apron on the bar
Packed her whole world in a suitcase
And tossed it in the car
Woke up in Texarkana
Wondrin' how she'd got this far
And on her own, on her own

Stranger at the motel let Jamie stay for free
She was gone before the daybreak
On her ways to Tennessee
Lookin' to make the whole world over
Into a place she wants to be
But not alone, not alone

Davey left his taxi
In the bottom of a Beantown lake
He said this whole world's full of chances
And this is one I gotta take
So he caught the line to Nashville
To finally find his break
And make a home, make a home

As the train flew out of Boston
His whole world passed him by
He said I spent a lifetime runnin'
And now's the time to try
If I can't find someone to hold me
My dreams will surely die
And I'll be gone, I'll be gone

[Chorus]

When Davey hit the pavement
The sky was almost gray
He lit a smoke off of the sidewalk
To drive the storm away
And when Jamie turned the corner
With the world upon her brow
Davey said I must be dreamin'
How could this happen now
And then she walked right towards him
Looked him right up in the eye
Davey reached out for forever
And Jamie walked on by",Easy Come Easy Go,2002

We'll all smoke marijuana as we look up at the stars

Came down in a bad scene

Singing for the tip jar
Underneath the neon light

It's really not surprising

Smiling on the lovers
Always shining on the others

Hidden by the break of day
That always comes too soon
Poor little thing
She's just a jealous moon

She plays above the water
Watching sailors, tramps and daughters
Live their lives and slowly fade away
Night afternight, year after year
Once she knows she'll disappear
Into a world she never gets to stay

But she would give most anything
To open up her heart and sing
But no one hears her tune

No one ask her how she got so high
Way up there forever in the lonely sky

She watches through the seasons
Hoping without reason
That someday someone will call her home
But life goes on without her
No one ever ask about her
Or lets her know that she's not alone

It breaks her heart that down below
Rivers run, flowers grow
But she can't feel them bloom
Poor little thing
She's just a jealous moon

The nights are getting colder
Stars are growing bolder
As they paint their final light across the sky
But closer to the atmosphere
She prays for clouds to disappear
So she could say goodnight and say goodbye

Hayley,"Sailing, sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to his arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

Sailing...

We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
Sailing

No more sailing

Left blooming all alone,
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred,
No rose bud is nigh,
To reflect back her blushes,
And give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one,
To pine on the stem.
Since the lovely are sleeping,
Go sleep now with them.
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow
When friendships decay,
And from love?s shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown

This bleak world alone?",The Last Rose of Summer,2007

At the hour of twelve at night
Who should I see but the Spanish Lady
Washing her feet by candlelight
First she washed them, then she dried them
Over a fire of amber coal

A maid so sweet about the soul

Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay
Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay

As I came back through Dublin City,
At the hour of half past eight
Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she tossed it, then she brushed it
On her lap was a silver comb
In all my life I ne?er did see
A maid so fair since I did roam

Whack for the toora loora laddy
Whack for the toora loora lay
Whack for the toora loora laddy

As the sun began to set
Who should I spy but the Spanish Lady
Catching a moth in a golden net
When she saw me, then she fled me
Lifting her petticoat over her knee
In all my life I ne?er did see
A maid so shy as the Spanish Lady

Hayley Kiyoko,"There's a silent peace
In the tragedies
Water washes clean
Until they're dry
Turn your shattered dreams
Into rhapsodies

This is where I keep you in my mind
I need you to be free

So this is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette
Ooh, ooh, ooh
This where I leave you

Every memory adds another piece
Purple, blue, and green
Just rest your eyes
Fortunes in the trees
Pure as harmony

This is where I keep you in my mind
I need you to be free

So this is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head

This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette
Ooh, ooh, ooh
This where I leave you

Dance in your color
Reflecting in your light
You're my horizon
You'll always paint my sky

This is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette

I walk through this world, just tryna be nice
They say I'll get hurt, if I'm not like ice
I know I've got friends, I still get so lonely

It's really not that fair, fair
I can't help but care

Caught up in the dreams, I can't create
When the city sleeps, I'm awake
Locked up in my mind, I can't escape
There's nothing I could do but wait
I call you crying 'cause it's too much pain
I can tell you don't get it
'Cause you tell me that everything will be okay

That's all I wanna do

Baby, I just dyed my hair
To make me feel like I don't care
It'll be my war paint
'Cause Lord knows I need strength, I need strength
Mondays might be alright
And Sundays will probably hurt
'Cause when your mouth starts moving with the noise
I don't hear a single word

Blankets of wool just to cover up my eyes
'Cause what I need, what I need is quiet
And I know what I need, what I need is hiding
I'm just a face, someone passing on the street
Paint on a smile so that no one ever sees
'Cause what I need, what I need is quiet

Talk to you, we all talk to you, oh, oh, oh

It's easier for me to stay quiet (Talk to you, they all talk to you)
And not speak a word
For if I do, then the truth might emerge
They are my emotions to feel
Nobody can poison my feelings if they're never revealed
I'll watch others live in loudness
And I'll destroy the chaos in my way
I have the control
If I keep what's mine, I can have the purest soul
And live with content, free from fear
I choose my actions
I'm the gatekeeper

Can see the universe/
Spinning round like a pin in your hand

Dip your fingers in paint/ go and skip up the street/ just try
To lighten up some
You're living your life like you're dead and in over you head

But checking numbers isn't how
To know how old you've grown
It's only what you want
It's only what you want

Say you want purple hair/ there's the truth now the dare/ I think
It's such a shame that
Growing old before our time is just a way to survive now

Stop and look at the sun/ tell me what have you done today
That left you dreaming
Cause living life's not a goal/ it's been happening all along the way

And checking numbers isn't how
To know how old you've grown
It's only what you want
It's only what you want

Laughter all over the world
Is doing all it can to have its secret heard
It's only what you want

It's only what you want/
It's only what you want

Hayley Westenra,"I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted.
There was no ransom to be paid,
No song unsung, no wine untasted.

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame.

He slept a summer by my side,
He filled my days with endless wonder.
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came.

And still I dreamed he'd come to me,
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that can not be
And there are storms we can not weather.

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living,
So different now from what it seemed",I Dreamed a Dream (from Les Misérables),2004
Hayley Westenra,"
Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamp light
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile like the old days
I was beautiful, then I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sun rise
I must think for the new life
And I mustn't give in

When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And the new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me !
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

I'll show you wealth

You've never seen

The sun and moon and shadows

The rainbow's arch, the mountain stream

The sunless clouds

And the winter's dream


I'll play you sounds

You've never heard

The waterfall, the river

The thunder of the hummingbird

The whisper of the snow


What if you never know

How much you cared

Till you are parted

By a stormy sea


How could I let you go?

How could I bear

My life without you

Here with me!


The world's a door

That's open wide

Because you're here beside me

And with the moon and sun

To guide me

Now my heart

Can fly

Now our hearts

Can be freeeeeeee!


",Here Beside Me,2005
Hayley Westenra,"Today we took a walk up the street,
We picked a flower, climbed a hill above the lake
Secret thoughts, you said aloud,
We watched the faces in the clouds
Until the clouds have blown away
Were we ever somewhere else you know
It's hard to say

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that

I can't believe
A month ago I was alone
I didn't know you, I've never seen you, or heard your name 
And even now, I'm so amazed it's like a dream
It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain
Some things are the way they are and words just can't explain

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that before

It feels like now, it feels always,
And it feels like coming home

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that before

Oh, oh I

Hayley Westenra,"Through the window of my soul
All the secrets that I hold
Will be yours to share for always, always

Like a whisper in the wind
The gentle breeze touches my skin
And I know you're with me always, always

I can feel it in the air
The fire that we share
Can only come from deep within

It's a light that burns so bright
It guides you through the night
And leads you to me
So find your way back

And hold me, touch me
Let the love come rushing through me
I'm yours with every breath I take
Forever and ever

hold on, to love
Cause deep down
That's what we're made of
Never let go for my heart's sake
Cause my heart belongs to you

I lie awake to hear you breathe
Only you can feel the need
That builds and burns so deep inside me, inside me

As the moon lights up the sky
There's a thousand reasons why
My heart will only beat for you

You're the reason that I live
So now all I've got to give
I give it to you
Just don't fight the feeling

Hold me, touch me
Let the love come rushing through me
I'm yours with every breath I take
Forever and ever

Hold on, to love
Cause deep down
That's what we're made of
Never let go for my heart's sake

Love will see us through?

Wouldn't feel this cold inside

And the wreath is on my brow;
Satin and jewels grand
Are all at my command,
And I am happy now.

And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell -
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.

But he spoke to re-assure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the church-yard bore me,
And I sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
""Oh, I am happy now!""

And thus the words were spoken,
And this the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Here is a ring, as token
That I am happy now!

Would God I could awaken!
For I dream I know not how!

Lest an evil step be taken, -
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now.",Bridal Ballad,2005

And yesterday is there beside us

It's near beyond the moon

Come and hold me so

And I know that I'll see you again

Fading away

Hayley Westenra,"In another younger day I could dream the time away
In the universe inside my room
And the world was really mine from June till September

And if it wasn't really so I was lucky not to know
And I was lucky not to wonder why
'Cause the summertime is all that I remember

A summer fly was buzzin' every night when I was young
In the gentle world my childlike senses knew
And the world was just my cousin, and the wind was just the tongue
In the voice my lonely moments listened to

And I look at me today all the dreams have gone away
And I am where I never thought I'd be
Seein' things I never thought I'd see happen to me

And I lie awake at night till the darkness turns to light
Hearin' voices callin' out my name
Callin' over and again the same message to me

Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's your baby now?
Who wakes up at night to pull you in?
It don't matter, you'll just make him lonely anyhow
Don't know why you even try to win

Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's your baby now?
Who wakes up at night to pull you in?
It don't matter, you'll just make her lonely anyhow
Don't know why you even try to win

Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's your baby now?
Who wakes up at night to pull you in?

Hayley Westenra,"Soft as the voice of an Angel,
Breathing a lesson unheard,
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word.

Wait, till the tempest is done,
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is gone.

Whispering hope, whispering hope
Oh, how welcome, welcome thy voice,
Making my heart
In its sorrow rejoice.

Hayley Westenra,"Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.

But I will hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.

Hayley Westenra,"Sonny lives on a farm, in a wide open space
Take off your shoes, stay out of the race
Lay down your head, on a soft river bed
Sonny always remembers the words Mamma says

Sonny don't go away, I'm here all alone
Your Daddy's a sailor, never comes home
Nights are so long, silence goes on
I'm feeling so tired and not all that strong

Sonny works on the land, though he's barely a man
There's not much to do but he does what he can
Sits by his window in his room by the stairs
Watching the waves drifting soft on the pier

Many years have rolled on, Sonny's old and alone
His Daddy the sailor, never came home
Sometimes he wonders what his life might have been
But from the grave Mamma still haunts his dreams",Sonny,2007
Hayley Westenra,"The ring is on my hand,
And the wreath is on my brow;
Satin and jewels grand
Are all at my command,
And I am happy now.

And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell -
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.

But he spoke to re-assure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the church-yard bore me,
And I sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
""Oh, I am happy now!""

And thus the words were spoken,
And this the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Here is a ring, as token
That I am happy now!

Would God I could awaken!
For I dream I know not how!
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken, -
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now.",Bridal Ballad [The Merchant of Venice],2007
Hayley Westenra,"When I'm lost in a tunnel of shadows and fears
With no light, only night.
And I listen for kind words but nobody's here,
Oh so blue, all but you.

You are the one voice
That gives me my own voice
Oh don't you know?

You are water on a hot summer day
For a thirsty daughter who's finding her way.
You are water, I found my oasis
I'm drinking from the fountain of dreams
You are water.

You hear the melody of my song.
You stop time, heal my mind.
You show me struggle can make you so strong.
Plant the seed, let is sleep.

You are the one voice
That gives me my own voice
Oh don't you know?

You are water on a hot summer day
For a thirsty daughter, finding her way.
You are water, I found my oasis
And now I've got my arms wide open,
Now we've got my wishes in motion and
I want to thank you, yeah I want to thank you.

Every step that you take...shows me the way

Y en cada verso pone su corazón

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena canta el tango con voz de sombra
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Tus tangos son criaturas abandonadas
Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway
And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray

And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it

Rainbows are visions, but only illusions,
And rainbows have nothing to hide

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection

Who said that every wish would be heard
And answered when wished on the morning star?

Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection

We know that it's probably magic

I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it

And her hair made her look like a hoe

Time for your bottle my sweet

This little brat smells like piss

[Stewie:]
Alway's a succulent treat

[Thought:]
While I suck that, you suck this

Aren't you a sight

Look at him drool

Ah ah Come on.
You are not the only one
Going through what your going through you know what I'm saying?

Ah come on ah come on
I don't give a fuck what position you find yourself in
Just find security knowing somewhere else
someone is going through the same struggles you are right now
and it's probably me

I remember December middle of a bitter winter
Ass on the trunk feet swinging by the fender
Arguing with you in the freezing cold
I was wrong you ain't have to leave me though
Out here fucked up all alone
And what I really want to say is come on come home
But I got this load on me
Couldn't be worse than my momma died or my main homie told on me.
Hold me grand mom standing in front of her house
Tears trickle off my cheek and onto her blouse
And I realize now that once she's gone
I'ma truly know the meaning ah being alone when I'm...

What's up to all the home girls?
Caught up in this world
Preoccupied with money and sex powder and x
Little momma I promise its not the solution
I'm aware your life's style is full of confusion
I saw you at my show I had no time to talk
So close your eyes and imagine were taking a walk
Compliment you on your beauty your handsome behind
But at the same time tell ya god gave you a mind
And you should put it to use go back to school
So you can have something with or without these fools
Don't let no dude beat you miss treat you
You deserve to be loved I understand you attracted to thugs
But pick a real motherfucker that's gonna treat you well
Not no dead beat staying in and out of jail
Its hard when you out here alone and cold
That's the shit that make a stripper chick work that pole 'cause she's...

A damn fool for letting Cathy leave I contested
Every convicted felon that had ever been arrested
Every quiet child that had ever been molested
Every struggling rapper that had ever made a record
Every average cat that ever came in second
A proud father changed diapers and warmed bottles
Made a honest living and now I'm a role model?
A good dude for your son or daughter to look up to
Be here when the world got em feeling like... fuck you
Help them see better days and overcome obstacles
They go to school and hurt somebody I'm a feel responsible
Something I could a said something I could have did

Haystak,"She was the prom queen, the world was hers
With a wave of her hand, whispered words
Hearts broken by her abilities
Addicted to the sweetness of a gentle kiss
Lost in a search for something she might never find
Never know if she don't try, the results will come in time
No time to smell the roses, let alone slow dance
Too many bad memories of forgotten romance
She walked out slammed the door
Damn him, she didn't need him
A child game she had to cloth him feed him
Alone after so long gave up hope
Convinced all men were abusive
Undependable heathens and sold dope
Mister right wasn't coming
A fact that she would have to face
She didn't have no time to waste, she had a man to raise
No man to chase, sick of living in this blasted place
No time to sit around weeping like a basket case
Her  son made it all worthwhile
The only man that got to see her smile
She reminisced about her lifestyle before the baby came
She did what responsible people do, she changed

[Chorus x 2]
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was my best friend, my playmate
Moved in next door just before the first grade
We ran foot races, climb trees, caught insects
Before money and sex, powder and x
Before popularity came so crucial
She had love and the feeling was mutual
We used to cut our feet barefooted in chipped glass
Now we blow smoke as we skip class
New friends came, and with them came change
The pressure was all, would lil mama maintain
She began to drift away, the distance between us grew wider
Didn't have to speak to me, I could see the hurt inside her
I hear the words out of her mouth
But they don't reflect what she really feel
I've seen the smile before I know it isn't real
Artificial happiness, superficial friends
A nonstop whirl wind, when will it all end
Her eyes roll back, she began to convulse
They searched for a heartbeat, but she had no pulse
Autopsy results show she mixed powder and downers
And none of her new friends were around her
When her family found her, but a

[Chorus x 2]
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was a young girl seventeen, if I recollect correctly
A baby with a baby, that baby was me
She worked everyday still it wasn't enough
World was rough, ol' girl was tough
Drop me off in the morning
Come back and get me in the afternoon
Free spirits lost being guided by the moon
Used to take me to church, try to make me a man
But hard times put drastic changes in plan
She was out there, every time she got up, she fell again
In love with a bastard, stay in and out the pen
Alcoholic addict, never tried to change himself
Beat her to a pulp, and make her blame herself
I tried to talk to her, mama you don't have to stay
Just pack your bags and go, you can walk away
She tell me about this pain, hoping I'd never experience it
Baby boy love is some serious shit, I pray for change
Eventually it came, like rays of light after days of rain
She turned her life around, walked away never to return
Still tempted by the fire, just tired of being burned

She's a different kinda lady

I remember when I was young
All my people told me I could
Be anything I wanted to be when I grew up
You know what I'm saying, and that's it for us
I was a big old white boy from
Tennessee that wanted to be a rap star
And that was fucking impossible

I over came opsticals did what they said couldn't be done
I went from murder dog to fire?? I'm the one
The only one who held it down for white class
Before it was cool to be white trash
You can't change the world so why try
Watch them chains to tidies
From fist fights to drive bys
I be out there late night and I'm white guy
So when I'm gone say goodbye to that white guy

I dedicate this to the hags and fags
Who associate Haystak with racism and rebel flags
You fucking bitch
When you mention me speak on killer weed and body bags
Hi proportion? And burning the flag
My grand daddy's mammy was half Cherokee
My grand mamma family came from an island in Germany
And me I'm just a mixed breed from Tennessee

I'm from the land of the brave
Home of the free
And there's five million other fools just like me

We the have-nots little badass kids
Momma doing bad, dad der doing a bid
And we was set free to do as we please
Reek havoc on the streets of our communities
And we didn't have no curfew
We didn't have no rules
We don't need no book bags cause we don't go to school
Imagine my middle finger
In the mother fuckin sky
Screaming CWB till I die

Born a bastard child who struggled with love
We congregated on the corners puffin and pushing dubs
A lack of love a lack of understanding
A lack of compassion a lack of better parenting
The sad thing is either they don't know
Don't show
Or just don't care, well
That is till tad and rad?
Come to school with gauges
And start shooting up the rich kids in the faces
Mom and dad ducked in their shoes
""It was the crowd they hung around
Music that they listed to""
White boys been dying around here for years
But it never make CNN
You know why
We were put here to die
So when we kill one another
It comes as no surprise
We animals in their eyes

Can't tell me nothing about no damn stereotype

He left a going away place for me, and when he prepared that place
He'll come back and receive me, now where he is at, I'll be...
Now that's what you call a beautiful thought, Jack

( Verse 1 )

This mics on? I take chances and play a lot of felony games
That's why my rent and my utilities are in melony names??
Sometimes don't ever change, it's too easy to obtain
Cocaine, that's why my people did that devil in the dope game
I've done the dope thing, tenths, graphs, quarters, halves
I was a natural 'cause I was pretty good at math
Hot temper you can catch me on a warpath
You know what they say; hard head make a soft ass
Livin life like tonight can be the last night
Cops in the car with the dogs and the flashlights (fuck!)
Got me laid out across the hood
It's all good it nothing but leather wood
This harassment is nonstop, and when it's not the cops it's the block
Haystak didn't come back whippin no Maybach
How fake is that, y'all know me better than that
But I'll rock a drop top SL Escalade truck and shit

Don't that muthafucka know he had to suffer
He keep on comin through with that and end up a sucker

I was a broke head, a raggedy broke head
Probably end up in jail dead or be a cokehead
My mission to get more bread, more fed and more head
Work hard until I drop dead
So much sweat and blood shed
Tears I wept, the nights done came and went and I never slept
It's crazy what one would do to po to rep?
It's boundaries, men don't overstep
But yet, the news ?? incidents
Dude didn't have to die, that shit was senseless
Violence is sadistic, it grows on our existence
Me personally, myself, I'm against it
But so many dudes from other crews stay with him
You ain't gotta a chance if you get to beefin with him
Got six guns, shotguns and handguns
Semi-automatic magnums, keep your pants up
We can't afford to get caught with them now
And they roll up on ya like ?Yeah, talk shit now!?
And they already got they guns out
But time won't allow you to get yours out (blaow!)
And about the time that you reach for your pocket
Bullets hit your muthafuckin ass like rockets
You couldn't return fire, it happened so fast
That's what they do they roll up and bust a cap in your ass
Now it's just a bunch of good talk about ya in slow songs
Everybody telling everybody to be strong
Positive, 'cause they gotta move on
Even though shit won't ever be the same now that you gone
Gone, meanin dead gone meanin out here
Gone, meanin you meanin you won't have no birthday next year
Gone, meanin your kid no longer got a father
'cause pops was out there provin he was harder

( Verse 3 )
My ?? is ??, accomplish impossibilities
So much hositiliy hemmed up within me
So many ends and very few friends
I made thick and through muthafuckas who ride to the end
You be lucky if you got enough to tote you to the hole
'cause them fair-weather friends get low when it's cold
I got women in my yard, diggin for gold
Mama said they was coming and ???
I made a lil money, people think made a money
Sometimes, I wish God would just take it from me
So I can see who's around here 'cause because they love me
And I could know who'd be down with me if I was bummy
Who'd feed me if I was hungry, clothe me if I was naked
And who'd kiss on my dick 'cause I made a few records
Who'd be at the hospital when a tragedy happened

2's, 3's, and 12's is only relevant on your first roll and they craps

But I never gave up and never stopped copin
Pits in the yard, a bucket in the driveway
I'm gonna turn that bitch into a new truck one day
Someday, 'cause I'm gonna get out here and work until
I get a mil, fuck the lotto and a record deal
It's real, when you don't even know when your gonna get your next meal
Even though when you straight, you still feel like you on them X pills
Can't sit still, you pace back and forth
Cross the floor until you can't take no more

I took sixteen zips of that Mexican red
Weighed my quarters at five, charged an arm and a leg
Busted heads, this move dealt me a new hand
The eight I invested was now two grand
Met a busta at a club and told him I was the man
Met up with him, sold him a quarter ki of sand
A young dude, my mentality was like fuck dude
We like some pit puppies fightin over dog food
In school I sold candy a quarter a piece
I made my money off three and the rest was all me
In life I fucked a couple of good connects up
So if you in the car with me keep ya heads up
Worked so hard but couldn't stack no bread up

Without my people I couldn't have made it rappin'

Because I couldn't have done it

When you least expect it.
But if you love them, and they love
you the same way, believe they got
they're eyes on you right now.

Sail on across the sky I see you on
the other side you helped me so
much, I'm much obliged I never got
to thank you.
Sail on across the sky I soldier up and
dry my eyes I wish that I had got to
hold you, but I'm just glad that I got
to know you.
G hit me on the nextel chirp and he
told me ""big homie don't repeat
these words but I just heard this
'bout the B-I-G and I can't get ahold
of Jelly.""
Damn.
I'm the one that made them phone
calls dreaden' havin' tah talk to my
roll dog.
I'm the one that went and beat on his
front door.
The look on my face kinda described
what I came for.
Tried to keep him focused when he
was ready to go to war.
But then again, ain't that what friends
are really for?
Biggie, I know we never was that
close, but I can't describe the impact
it had on roll.
I did a show with lil' dude just the
other night, he made everybody in
that bitch be quiet and have a
moment of silence like real G's do.
Lighters up, in memory of you big
homie.

[CHORUS]
I can still see us at the red light,
homes.
Customized whips with the headlights
on.
Boxes bangin' them old gangsta
songs, everybody tryin' tah figure out
what went wrong.
I done seen every one of my people
hurt.
Been there when my homeboy was
'bout to go berserk.
Been that dude, myself.
I done carried the casket, had to look
at my homeboy after he got blasted.
Nothin's guaranteed, take advantage
of today, 'cause you never know when
your life will be taken away.
And when I go, just let me slide
across the sky.
Because you gotta know, baby, even
bosses die.
Just imagine me on streets of gold,
ridin' chrome.
Think of it like this: daddy called me
home.
I ain't gone, I'm right here you just
can't see me.
But we can still talk, why you think I
made them CD's?
I'm as free as a bird, now.
And this bird you cannot change.
Who'd have thought you'd see me in
ICU?
Prob'ly thought I'd see you in ICU.
You can't see me, but I see you.
Wish you could hear me sayin' ""Baby,
just be cool.""
I know it's gon' be hard without me
there.
You can make it, baby, just hold me
down.
I'm on the other side, where it's all
clearer.
Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry for
my pall bearer.
It's gon' take a dozen people just to
tote your homie to the hole.
Quit all that cryin' and holdin' on, go
on let me go.
This ain't the first time we done been
through this together.
I know you didn't think I'll be here
forever.
Tomorrow's not promised, I took
advantage of the moment.
I never was happy here, yeah, and
you know this.
I was discontent like an instrument
that had no one to play it, you know
what I'm sayin'

Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in

Si me necesitas llama ¿por qué no?

Apunto alto me lo guiso apuesto por la noche
Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches
Hago piezas de coleccionista y broches
Sin palabras no hay personas

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona
Esta mona no se anda por las rama
Hablo claro consecuencias llegan
Si me necesitas llama

Café me mantiene cada mañana
Cada día en pie estudiando ciencias vigilando aceras
Mi ruido cae en la coctelera, en la hoguera
En la autopista un ungüento que no hace cualquiera

Sin embellecimiento en ese carro sin asiento
Me sientes lo siento yo no practico el arrepentimiento
Mi templo tiene cimiento
Puño y letra piso con seguridad, tos buscan equilibrio

Yo no freno calibro con brió aire sobrio
No cojeo os cojo dormío hijo mío
Te lo dan todo hecho y no dices ni pió
No se puede hacer mejor

Unidad de crisis a la orden del día
Si to' fuera perfecto ¿qué dirías?
Otro día más la misma mierda

¿Porque no? Apunto alto me lo guiso a puesto por la noche
Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches
Hago piezas de coleccionistas y broches

Sin reputación no hay respeto conozco esta zona

Cualquiera cuestiona, pocos responden
Dime como, cuando, donde
Somos los mismos con dinero y sin dinero
Yo no pido estragos lo mío primero

Sudo me cuesta trabajo hacerlo a mi manera
Lo estamos intentando, ¿qué más quieres?
Míale lamiendo las mieles yo tengo lo que tú quieres
Mala sin ser uno nueve siete nueve

Sé quién eres y con cuanto vienes, entiendo idiomas
Fíjate quien va hablar mírame a los ojos
Fíjate quien va hablar tengo pájaros en la cabeza
Que razonan encerraos en jaulas aprendiendo a hablar

Aunque duela dime la verdad
Le estás haciendo la cama cariño
Luego vas a tenerte que acostar en ella en la vida real
De qué sirven los respetos

Oyendo ruidos que hacen los animales y los coches

Haze,"Vivo en una cárcel sin muros, se llama ignorancia
Perdí la inocencia, la infancia y gané respeto 
Aprender en la calle es duro, probé las sustancias 
Sentí la violencia y el ansia por ganar dinero 
Frío, bandera negra pirata mi alma 
He sido, carne de cañón, sentí el calor del cañón 
Pero el calor del cariño en mi piel yo nunca lo he sentío 
Aquí las sirenas anuncian otro barco hundío 
Perdío, de quién me fío
Lucifer las carga pero no es el que dispara el arma 
La blanca me calma, pierdo el sentío 
Estando ciego no siento
Cállate puta conciencia, sé lo que he perdío 
Quién tiene la culpa, quién conoce los límites
Un narco en un barrio es un héroe, yo solo lo imité
Me refugio en la escritura, el tiempo es mi vigía
Una carta más en esta celda fría

En esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene

Muero en una vida distinta, se llama presidio
Conmigo vive el odio y reside la venganza 
Un bala perdía, un pinta, pienso en el suicidio 
Ella no viene a verme, no me escribe mi esperanza
No pienso perderte, no te llegan mis cartas
Maldita sea, estoy en el patio, buscando pelea
Con sangre en los nudillos, el corazón me patalea 
Me suda el carajo el funcionario y que me vea
Si no vienes, si no escribes, me siento solo 
Voy a chinarme como un perro, a desangrarme en el chabolo
Y luego sentiré el frío, de qué me sirve rezar
Dios mío, te desafío

En esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene 

De noche me quedo dormío, y sueño que has venío a verme 
Entonces se me pasa el frío y en el recuento no me despiertes

Y en esta celda, me estoy muriendo por verte
Dibujo en las paredes, un corazón con tu nombre 
Y en esta carta, pido que vengas a verme
Porque me siento mu' solo y el tiempo aquí se detiene 

Esto es un canto de esperanza 
Pa' un mundo de cemento y hierro, 
Adri, vuela, vuela lejos de alhaurín, y tú
Y tú, compi, paciencia, seca esas lágrimas
Que de ahí se sale, me entiendes
De ahí se sale, libertad

Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something 
Too

[Chorus: x2]",It Ain't Easy,1996
Hazel Dickens,"Well I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And it's not your fault that I tried to be what I thought you wanted to see
Smilin' face shinnin' hair clothes that I thought you'd like me to wear
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

Yes I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And I tried to see life your way and say all the things you'd like me to say
Lovin' looks gentle hands an guaranteed to keep a' holdin' your man
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

And now you say you're tired of me and all of those things I thought you wanted me to be
Is it true you want some one who knows how to think and do on her own
Lord it's hard to realize the lessons I learned so was young were nothing but lies
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

",Custom Made Woman Blues,1973
Hazel Dickens,"Oh the green rolling hills of West Virginia
   Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
   Though the times are sad and drear and I cannot linger here
   They'll keep me and never let me go.

My daddy said don't ever be a miner
or a miner's grave is all you'll ever own
There's hard times everywhere I can't find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I've ever known

So I'll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you'll find me there
Though I'll leave the past behind 'll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear.

Someday I'll go back to West Virginia
To those green rolling hills I love so well
Oh someday I'll go home and I know I'll right the wrong
And these hard times will follow me no more.",The Green Rolling Hills of West Virginia,1973
Hazel Dickens," Now you're back on my doorstep a' crying
   Like I cried through all those lonely years
   But I can't dry your tears it's been too long since love was here
   And I've already gave you my better years

And so the pages of time kept right on turning
They never stopped for us to harvest the years
And old embers of love kept right on dying
For there was no one to drown my tears.

But I've tried not to blame you
and I try not to shame you
All I can do now is wish you well
But if you should need a friend
I'll be there until the end
Just don't ask me to love you again.

   And don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   Hoping for what's been dead so long
   For the embers have all turned to ashes
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.

   No don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.
",My Better Years,1973
Hazel Dickens,"Call him drunken ira hayes
He won't answer any more
Not the whiskey drinkin' indian
Not the marine who went to war

Gather 'round me people
There's a story I would tell
About a brave young indian
You should remember well
From the land of the pima indians 
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the phoenix valley 
In arizona land

Down their ditches for a thousand years 
The waters grew ira's people's crops
Till the white man stole their water rights 
And their sparklin' water stopped
Now ira's folks grew hungry 
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came ira volunteered 
And forgot the white man's greed

Call him drunken ira hayes
He won't answer any more
Not the whiskey drinkin' indian
Not the marine who went to war

Well, they battle up iwo jima hill 
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty seven lived
To walk back down again
When the fight was over 
And old glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was indian ira hayes

Call him drunken ira hayes
He won't answer any more
Not the whiskey drinkin' indian
Not the marine who went to war

Ira hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand;
But he was just a pima indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what ira had done 
And when do the indians dance?

Call him drunken ira hayes
He won't answer any more;
Not the whiskey drinkin' indian
Not the marine who went to war

Then ira started drinkin' hard
Jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag and lower it
As you would throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he'd fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch 
Was the grave for ira hayes

Call him drunken ira hayes
He won't answer any more
Not the whiskey drinkin' indian
Not the marine who went to war

Yeah! call him drunken ira hayes
But his land is just as dry
And the ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where ira died",The Ballad of Ira Hayes,1983
Hazel Dickens,"There's a path that leads back through my memories
And how often I've walked it these days
Where I find sweet piece among the flowers
On the grassy banks beyond the river bend

But it's only a memory
Yes it's only a memory my friend
Yes it's only a memory
I can never go back home again

Down by the river
Down by the old river bend
Down by the river
The sweet fragrance of flowers 

Oh it seems life troubles and trials
Get harder and harder to mend
Oh how sweet it would be to sit down
On the grassy banks beyond the river bend

But it's only a memory
Yes it's only a memory my friend
Yes it's only a memory
I can never go back home again

Down by the river
Down by the old river bend
Down by the river
The sweet fragrance of flowers ",Beyond the River Bend,1987
Hazel Dickens,"The bills are all dues, the babies need shoes, I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound, I'm busted
Got a cow that's gone dry, hen that won't lay
A big stack of bill's get bigger each day
The county gonna haul my belongings away, I'm busted

I called brother Bill to ask for a loan, I was busted
Lord, I hate to beg like a dog for a bone, I'm busted
My brother said, “There ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids, they're all down with the flu
I was just thinkin' of callin' on you, I'm busted”

Now Lord, I'm no thief but I can go wrong, I'm so busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone, I'm busted
The fields are all bare, the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
Where I'll make a livin', Lord only knows I'm busted
Where I'll make a livin', Lord only knows I'm busted

",Busted,1987
