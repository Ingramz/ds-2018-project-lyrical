Connie Francis,"Chorus
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love, goodbye

There goes my baby
With someone new
She sure looks happy
I sure am blue
She was my baby
Till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance
That might have been

Chorus

Im through with romance
Im through with love
Im through with counting
The stars above
And heres the reason
That Im so free
My loving baby
Is through with me

Connie Francis,"If you loved me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down.

If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you.

You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down.

Let me go
Let me go, lover
Let me be
Set me free
From your spell

You made me weep
Cut me deep
I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed 
From the first
Day I fell

You don't want me
But you want me
To go on wanting you
Now I pray that
You will say that
We're through

Please turn me loose
What's the use?

Now the heartaches have begun,
There's a job that must be done
I have no time for havin' fun,
I'm breaking in a brand new broken heart

Connie Francis,"They tell me that there's someone else you really truly love
And even when we kiss that she's the one you're thinking of
I guess it's true 'cause once or twice you called me by her name
I need you so but now I know that you don't feel the same
It's all over town, you've put me down
A second hand love, a second hand love

Though late at night I sit alone and count the tears that fall
I'd rather have this kind of love than not see you at all
My friends all say I'm better off if we should drift apart
But every day I hope and pray I'll be first in your heart
It's all over town, you've put me down
I'm a second hand love, a second hand love
Just a second hand love, a second hand love",Second Hand Love [*],1998

I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly
I'm in love and it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me

I can't do my homework and I can't think straight
I meet her every morning 'bout half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying your books to school
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me

You mixed me up for good right from the very start
Hey now, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart

You got me jumping like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Well since I kissed her loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me

Each one seeking happiness
Thrown by three hopeful lovers
Which one will the fountain bless

Three hearts in the fountain
Each heart longing for it's home
There they lie in the fountain
Somewhere in the heart of Rome

And the lovely day is through

I never knew that I could hurt this way 
Heartache Number Two was when you came back again

Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow

Has been broken in two

How's the world treating you?

Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away

Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true

So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say

Connie Francis,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
What will you lend on an old golden rule?

As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.

Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.",Alfie,1999

Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon,

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start,

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love,

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

Connie Kaldor,"The recital was just lovely
Everyone in town was there
There were bow ties, there were crinolines
And music in the air
And the orchestra was brilliant
And the thing that stole the show
Was the bloated round protrusion
On a little Pipkin nose

Have you seen it?
Have you set your eyes upon it?
It is hideously bulbous
No it’s not a pretty dimple
Have you seen it?
It is really quite amazing
Have you spotted little Sarah Pipkin’s pimple?

“It won’t last,” her mother said
“I want it gone now!” Sarah hissed
So they made a quick appointment
With a dermatologist
As the doctor poked and prodded saying,
“What do we have here?”
“Well,” the pimple simply stated,
“I’m a zit. That much is clear”

It could talk! It was prodigious
And its face was kind of cute
And its views on global issues
Were astoundingly astute
So the TV crews descended
People came from miles around
And the pustulent protuberance
Soon became world renowned

But not everybody loved it
“It’s grotesque” some did say
It simply stated, “You would not say that
Had you been born this way”
But its words were so enlightening
And they were noted quote for quote
Then one day, it simply vanished
And it left a farewell note

Adieu, adieu, my dear admirers
You’ve been great, you’ve filled my cup
But there’s a time and place for everything
And well, my time is up
But I hope you’ve learned a lesson
From this small tumescent mound
That in every living creature
There is beauty to be found

Had you seen it?
Had you set your eyes upon it?
It was clever, it sang showtunes
And its message was so simple
Had you seen it?
It was really quite amazing

Yet youÂ´re my favorite work of art 
 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, are you smiling? 
But donÂ´t change a hair for me, 
Not if you care for me.

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1994

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

And ordered orange juice for one

I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again

We love to flirt
To chase the skirts
Get to know who we are
Girls in the park
Cause when we in the club
We keep it extra hot
They love the whips the chicks
The neighborhood superstars
Boys on the block
Thugs in the hood we don't never stop
Never stop

I go where the masses go
We all act natural
Think rational
Those ? some blow
Cats have to know
Master your craft
Stash your dough
Stay on the low
But never be the last to know
The next level or plateau be international
The grass'll grow
You know
Cash'll flow
Ask a pro
Do the math
Get it fast or slow
Your girl's passin gold like a fashion show
The sun'll shine
Make it feel like the summertime
Shorty's runnin' blind
Lookin like they just done a crime
Click's want they pockets thick
Cop a ?
Proper chick
Street scholarships
Politic your dollars quick
? we ?
Cause we was the first in the pack
They say ""herb's a trap""
Now it's worse than that
So I observe the ?
Let my words attack
Until it ? the rap
Until the earth collapsed

You know it seem like life's just begun
My lust is young
I wanna find me a lovely hon
Crush me one
Bust a ?

Let her hug
And when I'm done
Tongue touch me 'til I'm numb
But first the outcome is income and then some
Get enough to run and spend some for fun
Then me and my thugs
We come in the club
We swung lovely
Watch how big the buzz be
Trust me son
Every ghetto got game in it
Fame in it
We remain in it
Waiting for the main event
Like the days on the corner
We watch the world go by
On the nights that wasn't right
Like when a good friend died
Yo the street's got a deadly hum
Like a drug
We gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love
From the park to the block
To your favorite spot
It don't stop

I spend the prowl
I been on since a child
It don't make sense to browse
It's intensive now
Women in crowds
I search for the gem in the ?
Who stay original
Even when the friends around
Since her style
Always commands a smile
And her femme fatale
Cause men to growl
I take precedent of principle
Then arouse
Still the treasure is rakim
The smooth criminal
Damn, it's on
Keep my hands on
This amazon
Legs for marathons
Voice like Sarah Vaughan
Precise, alright
I like when her ? entice
With a spice of life
Flow times twice as nice
And when she go shop
The show stop
Shock the whole block
She so hot
I clothes shop
Put it on lock
Body that won't drop
Bounce like hip-hop

Where mockingbirds used to sing

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

That keeps you on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother cause she turned and you were gone
I still might walk for hours tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you movin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
The shadows freek in the autumn winds that make me draw inside myself in silence
Cross legged now I sit and watch the endless chase of leaves across my yard
And layin' down my hair brush I lean back within my window seat and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry

I remember when I was a lad times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were tryin' to make a livin' out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singin' loud
[ Both ]
And daddy sings bass mama sings tenor me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long we'll rejoin them in a song
We'll join the family circle at the throne
No the circle won't be broken by and by Lord by and by
When daddy sings bass mama sings tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there in the sky Lord in the sky
[ Connie ]
Well I remember after work mama would call in all of us
And you could hear us singin' for a country mile
Though little brother has done gone on we'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

And daddy sings bass mama sings tenor...

Once a man whom we know as the son of God hung upon a cruel tree
He suffered pain as no mortal man
He took my place he did it all for me
When I step just inside of those gates up there
And the Master's face I see
I gladly kneel at his nail-scarred feet
Oh praise the Lord, he did it all for me
He did it all for me, each drop of blood he shed for even me

When the Saviour cried ""God is in"" then he died
Oh praise the Lord, he did it all for me

Connie Smith,"As performed by The Singing Rambos


The things that I love and hold dear to my heart
Are just borrowed they're not mine at all
Jesus only let me use them to brighten my light
So remind, me remind me dear Lord

Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I could have been
Remember I'm human, and humans forget
So remind me, remind me dear Lord


Nothing good have I done to deserve God's own Son
I'm not worthy of the scars in his hands
Yet he chose the road to Calvary to die in my stead
Why he loved me I can't understand

Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I could have been
Remember I'm human, and humans forget
So remind me, remind me dear Lord

So remind me, remind me dear Lord

Connie Smith,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

And he was born the next of kin

And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made him a slave to his wanderin' ways

Cincinnati, where the river winds
Cross the Mason and the Dixie Line
The heaven waits for me, I know
In Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio

I guess perhaps the memories got too strong
Grabbed me by the heart strings and pulled me home
I got to thinkin' 'bout some friends I know
In Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio
(Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio)

I walked half way from Lewie Ville
Now there she lies at the foot of the hill
Shinin' like a jewel in the valley below

Cincinnati, where the river winds
Cross the Mason and the Dixie Line
The heaven waits for me, I know
In Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio

Cross the Mason and the Dixie Line
The heaven waits for me, I know

Will bloom as a flower in the Master's bouquet

Till yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me

And this aching breaking heart of mind will mend

With blue eyes and hair of pure gold
On his stallion of white, he's seen the whole world
But I long to see deep in his soul

Then we took a walk by the sea
We laughed and we talked and we did some romancing

But Mother, oh Mother, how can I know
What his heart holds deep down inside
You've always warned me the trouble with love
It makes truth out of nothing but lies

He promised the treasures much more than I dreamed
He placed a fine ring on my hand
He pledged me his love, swore he'd make me his queen
We'd travel to far distant lands

But Mother, oh Mother, what if I go
And find that his love is not true
But if I refuse him, what if I lose him

Part of me says run away
Run from the flame of this burning desire

There was ten of us livin' in a two room shack
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
And everybody said we was po' folks
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Dug a forty foot well struck thirty-six gallons of dust
Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We lived next door to a millionaire
But we wadn't nothin' but po' folks
We was po' folks livin' in a rich folks world
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
He'd've had to brought a picnic lunch
My grandaddy's pension was a dollar and thirty-three cents
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote get out but pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
But that's how it is when you're po' folks
We was po' folks livin' in a rich folks world
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
He'd've had to brought a picnic lunch
But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
And the howlin' winds would get pretty rough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love
Cause that's what you do when you're po' folks
And we weren't nothin' but po' folks
My mom and my dad was po' folks
My brother and my sister was po' folks
My dog and my cat was po' folks
And even the po' folks was po' folks",Po' Folks,2001

Connie Stevens,"One fine day, I chanced to stray
On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental
She saw me and I saw she
Had a manner too bold and much too free
Her eyes were positively detrimental
When I asked about this gay coquette
I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

She's got a nervish, throwin' him a curvish
Which, of course, he doesn't deservish

Connie Talbot,"Oh little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in they dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

Oh morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on Earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven

No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in

Oh holy child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
Oh come to us, abide with us

To the Mississippi
We'll take the boat to the land of dreams

Connor O'Brien,"How much is enough? That's a really tough question.
You ought to give it some thought sooner than later.
Got off of the hooch and the crack - let's skip the smack down
But then you had to find yourself all over though.

Dad keeps looking at me says I got the disease.
Now what did you expect? You spent your life on your knees.
It was never too late; tell me, what were you afraid of?
Do the numbers in your head or get out the calculator.

Sorry that you think you had it rough in the first world.
You ought to get out and map sooner than later.
Now you've just run into a trap; you have to slow down.
Get out of your head and spend less time alone.

But you never know you get elaborate thought.
You lay awake at night and think that you are getting old.
You don't need to panic now; you got time to do that later.

When everyone was so excited to go there, but not you
He must be some great rock star, tattooed and shirtless

While the ashes of the dead, like a dandelion head,
Explode and then are scattered by the breeze.
We're such a long way back to all the fun that we had.
When nothing ever seemed to bother me.
But what can you do?
Brother, what can you do?
Sleep with the stars, and toil in the sun.

The parrot blues
Little voices mimic you
It's not so hard to make that sound

Cut your hair like Joan of Arc

They'll find you out

And when they do,

Sorrow all across the surface roads
Smoothing out the edges of the stone

All we are is colored sand

So pay to ride the ferris wheel

Is gratitude for what has been

Drive through the desert after night fall
Sleep on the shoulder keep the stars all to ourselves

Wearing nothing but a t-shirt
She's turning over on a mattress made of air

I close my eyes I see a stair case
Leading upwards into blank space
All of creation makes a sound too soft to hear

So I remain between her legs
Sheltered from all my fears
While bikers glide by highway shrines
Where pilgrims disappear

Keep you company on the weekends
Keep you company even once your mind was made

Said it's over and it's finished

Living's easy on a house boat
Let the ocean rock us back and forth to sleep

In the morning with the sunrise
Look in the water see the blue sky
As if heaven has been laid there at our feet

And I don't wanna go to your Mason lodge
There's nothing more sad than a lynching mob
Full of rational men who believe in God

That one day I'd wake up all alone
With a big family and emptiness deep in my bones
That I would be so blinded, turn a deaf ear
And that my fake laugh would suddenly sound sincere

I'm the king of the world

Now everyday there's a short intermission
While I sleep they start dimming the lights
But I've seen everything I ever want to see
Screaming ""Fire!"" in a theater people taking their seats
Watch it all go down like a stone in a stream
If you fall for your reflection you will drown in a dream

Tell me something real
Tell me something true
I just want to feel there's something left that I can do
But I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world",King of the World,2012
Conor Oberst,"What would it take to gain acceptance
To the grounds behind your eyes
You know I'm open to suggestion
The one you made we never tried

Let it slip right out from under
Your breath and it rolled around my head
It was nothing I'd consider
I knew it had to happen then

Stood on the banks of the Potomac
We watched the water rushing by
You said we should live in the moment
Then I'd miss you all the time

And I know no one will believe me
But I don't want a second chance
To be an object of desire
If that means slipping through your hands
If I had tried to make you mine
You would have walked away
I can't compete with memories
They never have to change

This world is full of missing persons
All of these unsolved mysteries
If someone says they know for certain
They're selling something certainly

So when I set myself to wonder
All the questions that remain
The only one that even matters
Is when I'll see you're face again

I keep looking back for artifacts
To prove that you were here
The sound that's been keeps echoing
It never disappears",Artifact #1,2014
Conor Oberst,"He's my friend but he's no friend to me
Ask him why, he'll tell you casually
Washed up, bitter, broken, busted
Backstabbed everyone he trusted
Says he sees what no one else can see
And if I had half his guts I'd want it
To chase that fatalistic comet
Die young in the dark, that's poetry
But it was not to be, it was not for me

He's always sad but I've never seen him cry
When he comes to, sure he'll apologize
Find his car, assess the damage
Still drunk but he likes the challenge
Hold on to his mind just like a kite
But a good strong win can keep you honest
Fill you with some common knowledge
Things when we were young we never tried
Just figured we had time with such a long life

Money clips, alligator shoes
One more dance, he's in that champagne room
She moves like a chocolate fountain
Pouring, spilling all around him
Makes him wonder what else she can do
How bittersweet is love's illusion
Feelings that cannot be proven
Trust me, you'll see, my aim is true
I've done this all for you, I've suffered long for you

So many times he's tried to play it straight
Worked and worked until his body ached
But a brand new life can lose its lustre
Troubles tend to find each other
Call it luck or you can call it fate

Not the way that you imagined

Some will say you're brave
Some will say you ain't",Common Knowledge,2014
Conor Oberst,"Say that you were stranded on a desert island
What books you gonna bring what friends would tag along
Say you had a month and you knew you were dying
How would you spend your time
What goodbyes would take too long
You don't like this game and you take exception
Who wants all this trouble even hypothetical
With the charging sky above
And the ground below that could swallow everyone

Staring at your phone at another party
Spend a lot on clothes got a lot of skin to show
People in the pool like the drowning army
Smoke along the moats and the hotel lobby glows
Wish that you can dance but you've got no partner
Keep tapping on your glass because you want to make a toast
To the ennui of our times
To the selfishness in everyone you know
Made a lot of friends but they can't be trusted
Don't know what their angle is
Post up at the bar and I’m double fisted
Talking to a mannequin
I don't know what it means when he takes my pulse

Sets himself apart he's an instrument of god

Kissed her while he killed her like a good Samaritan

Interviewed her mother who said she'd now be 21
And although we lost her young
I know the good lord has a plan for all of us

Mormons at the door they are clean and handsome
Always have a good sales pitch
Your little sisters swears that she can take my order
But I can't take her serious
Need something to bring
For this human nature is not what this condition is
I'm so bored with my life but I'm still afraid to die
Everyone's asleep in this burning building
And I can't wake them up in time
You go on ahead I'll be right behind you
I'm headed to the finish line
I can't ignore the sun until this is over

Pretend that you were stranded on a desert island
What would be the message that you'd spell out for the plane
Say the engine failed when that plane was flying
If you were the pilot would you curse or would you pray

There's still room to grow

It's your double life on the other side
It's your second life on the other side

Conor Oberst,"He didn't give you that nickname
But you smile when he calls you the Enola Gay
Turns the lights down low for your migraines
And fetches what you've strewn
All around the room up and down the hall
Asking for your Sodium Pentathol
So you can read aloud from your big tell-all
Anecdotes in platitudes

This world's mean getting meaner too
So why'd you have to make it all about you
There's no harm in stepping to the side
Light your hurricane lamp when the sky grows dark
The wind's pissed off and the sun's at large
What you've gotta do, it's just a matter of pride
Until you vanish like the rest, out of sight and out of mind

Working all day in the control room
Mashing Charles Manson songs up with Showtunes
The feelings come quick but they leave as soon
Like music from a passing car
It's crowded in the club where you meet your friends
Try to save some room for the elephant
Every day's a chore and you're not done yet
You didn't think it'd be this hard

The root's begun, we're a nervous crew
So why're you trying to make it all about you
It's not so bad, it's just a flash of light
Light your hurricane lamp when the sky goes dark

Conor Oberst,"He came with his friends, in a caravan
To witness the governor's ball
Sat by himself on a cool patch of grass
While the rest stood like bricks in a wall
The stage it looked like a vending machine
The singer, a black barbie doll
But it was well light, and well managed
Said our property, would be damaged
Until his boredom, took full advantage
Of it all

Talk to a girl, with klonopin eyes
Who said she had jewelry to sell
First he said no thanks, then he realized
That he realized he wasn't feeling that well
And he took what she held looked like pieces of sky
And a garnet like teardrops from hell
She offered, him a necklace, and he wanted to accept it
But it would end up, too expensive, he could tell
Then she said:
""Why not, what have you got, to lose, to lose""

When he never came back, and the curve you have pathed
His friends searched the fair grounds for clues
But security guard the maniacal laugh
Said its always the leader you lose
And he finally turned up in the broad light of day
With a black eye as big as the moon
They all asked him, what had happened
Was it real or, imagined
Why on earth had, he abandon them so soon
And he said:
""Why not, I do what I've got, to do, its what you do""",Governor's Ball,2014
Conor Oberst,"What a thing to be a witness to the sunshine
What a dream to just be walking on the ground
What a time to live among the ashen remnants of our love
It came before and I'm still looking for that now

It took centuries to build these twisted cities
It took seconds to reduce them down to dust
And all the tour guide could say was
“Take your pictures folks it's late, try your best please to remember what was done.”

Don't look so forlorn
Don't you look so scared
Don't get so upset
This world was never fair

But there are hundreds of ways
To get through the days
There are hundreds of ways
Now you just find one

I used to think that time was of the essence
Now I just wish I could get some sleep
All this strange parade of sounds the city makes when I lay down
Little explosions that set fire to my dreams

Sometimes I get mistaken for this actor
And I guess that I can see it from the side
Maybe no one really seems to be the person that they mean to be
I hope I am forgotten when I die

Don't contradict me
Don't make me cross the line
If you feel threatened
It's only 'cause I might

But there are hundreds of ways
To get through the days
There are hundreds of ways
To get through the day
Yes, there are hundreds of ways
So you best find one

All my hero's they're all talk
Running in circles
Some stop watch some cast
Love was the message. Full stop

We ramble on and on
We ramble on and on

I stole all the rhinestones out of Carolina
Sold them out in Bakersfield for cash
The bandshell got a band sounds like an arcade in Japan
Blew all my quarters trying to get that feeling back

Now any sucker can turn boredom into violence
A sociopath riding on a bus
His irises are black from his novelty contacts
He looks around but he can't see the rest of us

In my sunglasses don't mind the blinding light
Yeah it's getting dark bro, but I've always loved the night

Conor Oberst,"Kick you know you're still a kid
And your diets too full of additives
Passed out on a couch with ashes in your mouth
Dreaming that you're hopping a fence
This world must have it out for you
From the shores of Montaca to Malibu
The trappings of a name you never could escape
Because people want to live in the past
Some goal they mentioned they never had

I thought they shot that Camelot

And the show must go on

Laying in an office on an old chaise lounge
Listening to the doctor drone
No therapeutic feeling once the shock wears off
Answer every question no
Hiding in a hammock with the shades pulled down
Wondering if the stories broke
Tragedy is prophet once the word gets out
Tablets at the country store
Searching under tables once the bars closed down
Said somebody stole your phone
Now there's no one to talk to but these trust fund drunks
Should have brought a chaperon

I don't believe in crescents

I took it on the chin from some second hand feeling
Sorrow handed down to me it felt brand new

Tiny violins or some summer insects listening

Freedom's the opposite of love

Emptying and the water from the glacier fills my shoes

A bindle of flowers to state his mind
And bloom when he forgets

Yelling out ""we fucking made it""
I'mma keep drinking 'till my time is up
Mile high club, I could give a flying fuck
I got pretty girls next to me
Rolling around the club cause I want my ex to see
'Cause I'm just trying to party though, sorry I'm not sorry though
Running to the top, I cannot stop, check out my cardio

DJ keep playing my favorite song
And all of these hoes singing along
I'm batting cleanup, bringing them home

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Sigue aquel dolor por creer en ti
Qué fue de la ilusión y de lo bello que es vivir?

Then I found my inner peace

Ninoy, you were my first love
But you said I was too tall
The heart gets stronger and grows colder
For the Rose of Tacloban

And take back all those things I said?

A necklace that watched over me
Face to face with mortality
I let go of all my fears

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blacky
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God ""Man why'd you had to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

Consequence,"Ayyo, good morning, America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching 'Good Morning America'
And good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good yay' to snort

I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys

I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad and things will only get bad

So now I'm getting bad skin and I got that badge and
Tellin' me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin' a bad day

So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly [Incomprehensible]
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""

I went from pretty Willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thin's will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down

Yeah, she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cuz she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home

So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulin Rouge on a too long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin' you with them two long shoes""

And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye' you don't love me?""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said, get ya money ain't no telling they gon' love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Ayyo, good morning to Queens, the North side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly

Had a beautiful night 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready to turn it up in these streets and make it ugly

Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly and lead a ball abruptly
But I took it all back 'cuz God don't like ugly

Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said, she had bad germs

The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood

And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good when you leave with the good
It's all good in the hood, got called good 'cuz it's good

Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon' make me a good wife
So I'm good to go and I'm good where I go
Come on, man got good aim and that's a good thing to know

And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game so what's good with this paper?
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

Ayyo, we showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

When I speak of diamonds in this song

Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses

Spend your whole life trying to get that ice

Who gave me good head while watching 'Good Morning America'
And good day, New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good yay' to snort

I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys

I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad and things will only get bad

So now I'm getting bad skin and I got that badge and
Tellin' me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin' a bad day

So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly [Incomprehensible]
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me, ""Don't touch me""

I went from pretty Willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thin's will still get pretty ugly

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down

Yeah, she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cuz she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home

So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin' scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulin Rouge on a too long cruise
She said, ""I ain't bonin' you with them two long shoes""

And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said, ""Ye' you don't love me?""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life is when you're forced to make it ugly

Had a beautiful night 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and it's ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready to turn it up in these streets and make it ugly

Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly and lead a ball abruptly
But I took it all back 'cuz God don't like ugly

Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said, she had bad germs

The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood

And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good when you leave with the good
It's all good in the hood, got called good 'cuz it's good

Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon' make me a good wife
So I'm good to go and I'm good where I go
Come on, man got good aim and that's a good thing to know

And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game so what's good with this paper?

Dinners on, get busy with my booty.
Got a couple of flavors, sweet licorice and fruity.
I know you're sad, luscious pussy with a cover.
I'm aching, too, we can't taste each other.
There's no slacking off with an unprotected stroke.
This ain't no joke.

Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down baby.
You suck, lick it hard, and move your tongue around.

Sisters, you've got the power, use it.

You brought a condom, right?
Huh?
I'm unprotected.
Ain't you on the pill?

Oh, that was great and everything, but you know 
I think it's your turn to go down on me.
I'm tired, I'm tired.
What do you mean your tired?
Come on baby, come on.
No, no, that's awful, that taste-terrible.
You asshole, you shit.

Well, I know you think it's a real drag,
To suck my cunt when I'm on the rag.
Quit making up stories, yeah give me a break.
'Cause I really don't believe that you got a headache.
You tell me it's gross to suck my yeast infection.
How do you think I feel when I gag on your erection?  (uh!)
Your wasting your tongue with lame excuses,
Get your face between my thighs.

Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down baby.
You suck, lick it hard, and move your tongue around",You Suck,1992
Consortium,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause

The things you are saying to me

Ma vie a beau prendre la pilule, mais elle n'accouche que des problèmes
Bien sur je l'aime ma vie des blocks, mais à la manière de Kurt Cobain
Avec un fusil dans la gorge et de l'amertume dans mes poèmes
Oui mec je traîne toutes les séquelles d'une jeunesse prit à la gorge
Car ici quand t'as la dalle, tu finis par bouffer ton auréole
Ici on te juge à ta couleur ou ton adresse
Donc t'as mis la cagoule pour que t'évites le délit de faciès
Oui ça fait la sieste au fond de la classe car encore une fois
Papa et Maman ont passé la nuit à se taper et à boire
Entre les guerres de religion et l'extrême consommation
Dans cette société qui joue à guichet fermé dans les prisons

Be one with the earth that bred you.

This is Metamorphosia, this is where we change.
Feel the intoxication as we shed our shells.
Time to change, to shed or shells, to forget about ourselves.

Welcome down, we are all equals here.
I'll exhale so you can draw another breath. 
A million eyes stare deep into your mind as you
Smile to greet the insect.
Such a sight, silken chrysalises pregnant with writhing larvae.
Come close, lean in, the line wears thin
Between your dreams and insanity.

It's such a small step, and I've got such sights to show you.
Come on down and forget about the rest.

No disgrace, no second place, no individual, deviant face.
There's no more hate, nor right or wrong, 
Come join us and we well be as one.
Why stand alone 
When you can write in pleasure together 
With a thousand more of a kind that knows no condemnation, 
Just life and death in an even
Score? It's all here, 
The answers that you've searched for, 
Just beyond your
Short sighted gaze. 
It's all here and so much more, 
So why don't you come inside? 
Step inside.

[Chorus]

It's such a small step, and I've got such sights to show you. 
Come on down and forget about the rest, 
Because soon they will be at one with you.
I am your insect slave, enter my hive. 
Honey like golden rain drips from above.
Trails of secretion will lead you the way to the womb of decay, 
The heart of my maze. 
Sunlight reflected through membranous wings 
Paints the strangest rainbow you've ever seen. 
Row upon row of white silk chrysalises invite you to join their ranks, 
To lay down and alter in time. 
As you change.

Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,1955
Conte Candoli,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,1955
Conte Candoli,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

",Comes Love,1955
Conte Candoli,"Flamingo, like a flame in the sky
Flying over the island
To my lover nearby

Flamingo, with your tropical hue
For it's you I rely on
And the love that is true

The wind sings a song to you as you go
The song that I hear below
The murmuring heart

Flamingo, when the sun meets the sea
Say farewell to my lover
And hasten to me

Aah-ooh, aah-ooh, ooh-ooh

Conte Candoli,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing

Conte Candoli,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing

Conte Candoli,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1957
Conte Candoli,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

Conte Candoli,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1973
Conte Candoli,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1989
Conte Candoli,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1991
Conte Candoli,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

Conte Candoli,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Conte Candoli,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1996
Conte Candoli,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

Conte Candoli,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2010
