Yo los, take us to a commercial
While we stop to get high
Y'all check out the young guns, ya heard me?

Check this out..
If you have four ounces and you fronted your boy two
And he gave a half to his boy
And the police raided the spot then he flushed one and a half
And he ask you for one mo'
What should you do if you was in that position?

[young guns]
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill

Tell them bitch niggaz - they can keep from around
This is family now, I give a fuck about you clowns
Young guns holdin it down, quick to bust a few rounds
? ? our sound, tell my niggaz and my bitches
They'll drop in the storm, tell them boys it's on
And these niggaz gettin they ass torn, fuck bein warned
This is a street ? ? , I promise to die violent
Now I start wildin, until you bitch niggaz are silent

Nigga fuck that! I'm bout to send these niggaz life back
They talkin shit about my fam and I don't like that
You know how I react, so why you wanna beef?
It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggaz gon' get numb
Here come ? ? down the block nigga don't try to run
I ain't lettin it slide I caught him slippin and him twice
Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

These niggaz fail the test so neverthless I split yo' chest
Fuck the rest!
I come through to spit, to show you niggaz what I manifest
A y.g., so I breathe toke three, ? ?
Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggaz in our town
You get them hot thangs laid in your mouth
My niggaz seek you out no doubt
All about my salary you niggaz ain't gon' handle me
I'm tired of stressin, and all these niggaz pretend they got me vexed

[young guns]
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real

Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

[Chorus]",The Day I Was Made,2013
Mia X,"fuck 
sometimes I just wish I could sleep it off
cause i dream about things that I know that i can't have
thing i know will never happen 
like a safe environment money happiness success
niggas want static than he going to get it 
i came up with blood money that means 
i'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos 
so they call me a baller i wiped a niggaz ass 
because I'm not a talker 
took a flight to kali came back with some birds 
ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt 
I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip 
shot a fool up in the club and then i changed my outfit
maintain and uphold my statis as a g 
niggaz kiss my ass because i got a lot of money
plain and simple niggaz leave huh when i don't feel'em 
because they know when they fuck up then i'm going to kill'em 
understand i was rasied where the young niggaz roam
if you wanted something nigga you had to get up on your own 
all these want to be motherfucken 
ass hustlers better wake up and stop killing on another 
cause

chorus 2x
I wish that life was a dream 
cause some times i wake up 
and just want to scream 
i live amounst the cut throats and the killers

??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013

I lost something in the past that was special to me
You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep
So give love to your motherfucking thugs alive cause
Ain't no seeing when your motherfucking loved ones die
Don't point the finger and criticize what he did
Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid
Will I ever see my brother again time will tell
I feel like I'm trapped between heaven and hell
I turned on the radio to forget the fun tears
Coming out my eyes cause I  hear I miss my homies 
On top of that my court dates tomorrow
Facing ten years added to my pain and sorrow
Baby momma don't want me to leave my kids

I live life to the fullest, true niggas don't run
Anticipating your death make you soft and sick
I leave my worries at home when I'm hanging with my clique
I reminisce about all my niggas that's dead
A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome
That's why I value nothin but family and friends
You lose material shit you can get it again
But ain't no coming back when you meet the reaper
I done lost to many thugs to the permanant sleeper 
Cause ahh everyday a nigger taking a chance
Only thug niggas feel my pain ( feel my pain )

It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise

Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang

I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.

So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust
I used to think the hood was cool 
But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch 
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

Lord control me 
You know me 
These cards I got to play em 
My life is like a game 
I'm up from a.m. to a.m.
My donner AK hem him 
If he don't have none of my paper man 
If I let him live 
He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now 
But see how us niggas get caught up 
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's 
2 23s 90 degrees
I left them windows down to feel the breeze
My cousin be	 and me and john in the back seat drinkin' off brome 
And to the z
Thinkin' bout the lives we gonna free 
Now tell a nigga please 
Soon as we drove up fuckin' doe was about to close up 
Knocked on the doe 
Nigga hold up you didn't see us rool up
I forced my way in I put my seven to his stars 
No time for thankin'
Is what I'm thankin' kill a bitch what you fittin' tuh say
I went to the kitchen I'm flippin' pans and pots and spoons 
I heard foe glocks
Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room
Its bout that time for us hounds to get 
Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone
Its over 
I come to lay ya eyes buggin' out his head 
Nigga bleedin' from the mouth 
He's shakin' he's on his way out 
But its time I took two from behind looked
John at the eyes and said nigga you ready tuh die damn nigga why",Ghetto Ties,2013

Girl I think i want to be with you
But it's something that I just can't do
I want to be faithful
See that's just me what i'm going through
I know i ought to be with you

I got to maintain my cool
Maybe i'm a fool
Can't keep you

[Silkk The Shocker]
Yo Yo Yo I never was the type to stress
Get It off my chest

if y'all was real
y'all can fill in the rest
we both say yes
guess we were both like phony
jumped in too quick
ideally cus we both was lonely
we go 2 stores and you never peek at the price
Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good
matter fact it was all that'
Sometimes i feel like we just didn't match
Found a friend
But only friend till then you alwayz came first
Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

Mia X,"[Chorus] 
Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

Most niggas might think I'm crazy when I tell em this

But you know what most nigga look up to like Presidents
Niggas that's in sports
All this type of shit as heroes
They might look at motherfuckin Muhammed Ali
Yah know Sugar Ray Leanord, Mike Tyson, but me..

[Master P]

Air Jordan ain't no motherfuckin hero G
My heroes is niggas in the ghetto that slang D
That right on chrome and triple gold and pimp hoes
And take any nigga in the click to the Super Bowl
And party like it ain't nothin
But most of my homies they done died over drug money
Like Bizzy Bob and Sam Skutty but I still love em
Air full of motherfucker and I still want to hug em
Big Dave, my nigga gone to the battle field
Dandon and Levi, damn guard ya grill
'cause where ya goin you gotta watch your back
Judge, god damn another nigga didn't make it back (Mr.C)
My lil brother Kevin Miller rest in peace
Elbraud, Nextditch, and Big Leaf
Lil Girl, and Boo, and Anguard
Big Pepper, God damn what y'all thinkin about
They gone, I mean they soldiers
But thets the type of cal i live up and hold to

Randy,Sir Pat, God damn
They got bigger, the list go longer
I could start from New Orleans and go back to California
To lil Tony,to dime P
Seritz,Burnell,can't believe
That he's gone, the Scarface
Dank,Loot,and Meathead
And what about Kenny Sep
And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe   
Pac, jinte, the gats go pow

Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money

A hero is a zero to me
The only hero that I know is them niggas in my hood G
They gave me the game so I enhanced the gat
Than I took the game, and ripped it out the frame
I tried and told ya
A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me
that nigga MoXs on the Howard J G

All y'all gangster niggas
Y'all motherfucking gangsta bitches out there (the dope game) 
I'm a let y'all know something (welcome to the dope game)
Something that'll never end, this shit is going on like fucking numbers
Black on black crime, nigga it go like this here
We live an eye for an eye

You kill me, I kill you, my partners kill your partners
And you dead ain't no love on my spot
Me and my partners pushing rocks
Got them 17 round glocks at your ass spitting like loogies
We packing heat, 32 round clips, my automatic uzi
But I look into the eyes and I stare, I see death
Goddamn thinking ""the fuck?"", it could be me
My little homie on the ground crying
I'm thinking I'm gone, Oh my lord
My little homie Tony's dying (ripped his heart out)
He never had a chance to see his life glow
And he never had a chance to see his wife bro
And his little kid is only 8
It ain't about me or you motherfucker 
You gone peep defeat off the tree  
Cause you die and you murder, how could you live on the streets
And you never hurt, another nigga with a glock G
I'm thinking about Tic-Toc Boom, there goes another one
Send him to the moon
Ain't no rocket ship bitch, it's the temple of doom
I mean the ghetto, cause it's wicked
Most niggas out there in the hood, trying to get a chicken
But never even seen a bird
They die for that cain and that weed and they water
And they to fucking high, to see the enemy
Niggas that pretend to be, fools don't come close to me
Your best friend will kill you
I'm from that 3rd Ward, Caliope Projects 
Where they peel your caps like bananas
Police trying to stand on them buildings with them radars and scanners
But they can't stop the murders 
That's happening in my hood motherfuckers
Cause everybody study capping in this
Everyday, all day niggas dying, mothers crying
But y'all niggas ain't realizing that the hood is murder
Find your ass in a 6 inch gurder
Cause niggas banging like Charlie Chan
You'd better pack a piece nigga 
And welcome to the never ending game

The never ending game, (the dope game) the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep, or die on these streets
Cause the ghetto ain't no joke
Niggas in my hood everyday getting smoked
Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies
Y'all can't stop a nigga please, even if I'm dead G

And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya

72 oz's, players I mean 2 ki's
For all you niggas that smokes 
I got my homies with the gats posted by the liquor store 
Cause we ain't takin no shorts, in the 9 scrilla
Say what you want fool I guess I'm a drug dealer 
>From the southside of Richmond, California
Where niggas run through with gats all up on ya
You better break North or South, before we take you out
Ain't no love in this motherfuckin' crackhouse 
Lay down on the floor bitch break me off
Before you meet my little partner Mr.Sawed-off
I'm goin crazy, Indonesia
Blowin' up the brown sticky nigga bout to please you
With this ketchup, watch I'll wet ya
Ain't no gettin up cause your in a mess bro

Drop the top on the Regal, shot a desert eagle
Candy cane switches that's how us G's roll
Hoo-ridin' to the lizzay
Seen Tina from the town laid her that's a dizzay
The side show was jumpin' (bumpin')
Oozin bikershorts and daisy dukes outside pumpin'
And niggas from Richmond rollin' hella deep
My little homies from Oakland got chased by the police
And these hoes want to kick it 
I met a bitch from Frisco gave me her number on a traffic ticket
And tonight I'ma page her
My niggas talkin shit bout these hoes fade ya
When your ballin they jealous they hatin'
I guess they mad cause a nigga own gold daytons
And they bitches started lookin at me
Niggas I'm trigger happy, fuck it and my ass nappy
Get more hoes than freak show 
Ask your bitch, nigga she know
But ya'll can't fade us
Cause No Limit niggas come harder than the Raiders
I'll break you off a little left and feel it chump 
What you see motherfucker is what you saw
Cause ain't no stoppin' No Limit
TRU and Master P it's only the beginning 
And we in it to win it like a roitweiler

And I'm up and outtie on a comeback

Ya know this is for you you hear me? 
Show me love 
When you see me on the TV show me love 
On the video

I'm asking all the haters to leave me alone 
And uh much love to the calliope 
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats 
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats 
And my success goes to the man above

When I was underground everybody down 
Everybody show me love, cause I share common ground

Them niggas was broke too but I'm a rapper so they think I'm not 
supposed to 
But they still on my team cause I got fame 
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name 
Yeah I know Mac, we go back, me and that nigga tight 
As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way 
y'all niggas don't know, I got so much shit I won't say 
I'm damn near breaking in tears as I'm speaking these words 
This same motherfucker from the third, show me love nigga

Five hundred dollars or so for my block

For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

[Mya]
It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

Watch them niggas you hang around with

Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up
Jumped on the freeway nigga fuckin' dashed bro
Think I see the rollers behind me through the rear-view

But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I ran through clear view
Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold
Told be	 to get that pistol
Jumped back in the bienz shoulda seen they head whistle

And flip bricks with ghetto chicks with no bicks
And nine's with no clips and sides wit no chips
Come fast or slow, from cheddar to dough

You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind

All my niggas gone bust they guns
Real mother fuckers never trust niggas, but we trust our guns
Get money is the code of the streets
Live by it, and they say the hotter the bullets, the colder the streets
Like the older the hammer, the older the beef
You holding the can and you busting or you die with your heat
Me and my niggas gone survive in the street
For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggas, just dieing to sleep
I'm in the hood and I ain't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO, with a pump in the seat and a desert eagle in the head rest
Live and I took 5, get respect cause I wont die
So its a bet that I'm gone ride

If I'm frying dog, you frying with me? (fry with me)
If I'm dieing dog, you dieing with me? (die with me)
Just know when the beef come, we all busting our guns (what?)

We can beef, I don't give a fuck, any street, stoop or block
Compton, New York City of Rocks
You ain't never been out the hood? don't go to far
12 gauge shotty, with a pump like Joe Dumar's
Shells the size of Sprewell lugs, go through cars
Rip apart your new Bentley nigga, like Dre sent me
The haze in me make me wanna kick back
Your man work out at bally's, put the 38 to a 6 pack
And beef keep the E.R full til the shit packed
No more rooms? let em die in the streets
Im from the CPT, where niggas dieing to eat
Them niggas with scars under they left eye and they cheek
Park a 745 on your street
Like mother fucker if you don't ride with me, you can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedy's nigga
I empty desert clips out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

I got niggas that'll beef for the game
Run up on your man, splat his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood, you better pay up
I roll with killas, that'll put you in a hole like a lay up
Ain't no sleep on the block, my niggas stay up
Cause they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales
Be in the XXL, and its only 6 street rappers if you wanna be real
That go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggas
Say my name in a verse if you ready to die
I call up my Harlem niggas on the i95
10 minutes later you dead on the I95

Lost at a crossroad that's missing a sign
How do we know if they made it alive

Fragments of light shine away from the dead
They fantasize fury, no time left to stop
Its darkness approaching now we're at a loss

Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away get lost and never be found

Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
Fly away get lost and never be found

Stealing the colour and life from my skin

Darkness approaches now we're at a loss

Miami Symphonic String Quartet,"Cuéntame, otra vez, como iba aquella melodía 
Que hablaba de nosotros dos 
La escribió, el que invento el adiós 
Cuéntame, otra vez, si no es el mismo sol 
De ayer el que se esconde hoy 
Para ti, para mi, para nadie más 
Se ha inventado el mar 
Se ha inventado el horizonte por llegar 
Donde existe siempre un donde en algún lugar 
Y aquel derroche de mi fantasía 
Mía, mía es
Y este maldito atardecer 

Y me iré, iré, iré, iré 
Y me iré, contando cada paso, no quiero 
Despertarte
Despertarte 

Y me iré, iré, iré, iré, iré, iré 
Te dejaré, un puñado de canciones
Y de besos nuevos
Niña y al final me iré 

Déjame, que te de cada segundo
Envuelto en un atardecer de vida 
Que para ti, para mi, para nadie mas 
Se ha inventado el mar 
Y recuerda que te desnude 
Y ninguno sabia muy bien que hacer 
Aquella noche, noche 
Noche, noche fría, nia, mía fue 
Y este maldito atardecer 

Y me iré, iré 
Me iré, me iré y lo haré despacio 
No quiero despertarte, despertarte 
Y me iré, iré, iré, iré, iré 
Perdóname, pero es que tengo prisa 
Que he quedado con mi alma 
Para pensar en ti 

No quiero despertarte, despertarte 
Para pensar en ti
Para pensar en ti

Iré, iré en ti para pensar en ti

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

You gotta set the caged bird free,

Mic Geronimo,"[Verse 1]
Notoriously enterprising, vocals for analyzing
I move, defiant speech more deeper than Poseidon
Give me, the highest esteem like hundreds of cream
Lick a shot off like Spock with them laser beams
Its the, greatest vocabularian in era
My styles vary like leathers, niggas rocking the serum
Living forever 40 ki's couldn't measure to the treasure
from these pedigrees I flow larger than see's
Cristal and Dom-P, getting sexed in the 'telly
 From bitches, who's in the running (how they look?) up with Halle Berry
I'm far from ordinary, I pitch a K like the arm of Satchel
Beware from the strength of the Natural

[Verse 2]
Now from below I die trying like a Japanese hero
Lyrics are Kilo's the outcome nothing but cee-lo's
Leave those, unprofessional pros alone
Enjoy the sound that's now emitting out the microphone
I'm every word personified, create astonishing lines
Go inside and pull a paragraph or two from my mind
Then decline the competition and recline inside the vision
Of uncanny type precision, hit 'em in all positions
Let it be known, my apparatus is stone
Inject the hyper tone inside the space between your headphones
I'm naturally grown, but leaving it sewn just like a surgeon
Money I'm splurging, that mean I got to leave it burning (right)
The simple fact, I'm like a Mac when I hit
Reality perceived to me, this ain't no counterfeit shit
Doing my thing-thing, I pitch a K like the arm of Satchel

With no direction, I rhyme with perfection skills 
Drug a nigga like a pill when it's time to build 
Keep it real, get your head rocked when I wreck shop 
I bigger with my style ain't a bully on your fuckin block 
Word is bond I go on 
I'm breaking MC's with vocal tones over real rap songs 
Insane in the brain nothing left to gain 
Grab the mic up with skill when it's time to build, Mother Fuckers 

This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, this is time to build 

Niggas increase the pain when they shout my name 
Horrified by the thought of hot slugs and graves 
Cause Ja is a sinister character loading that 44 caliber 
Infrared aimed at your jugular 
Who the fuck are you? Nobody cares 
You just be another nigga that needs repairs 
Talking to all them niggas shitting 
And all them faggots that be steady bitching, inside their insides twitching 
Sod sill delivering, DOA push a nine to your mind and commence the spray 
No bullshit, Natural's the king of left 
Scared of life but want to play the game of death 
What's next? Niggas wearing padded kotex 
Pussy ass MC's get treated like rough sex 
I'm possessed you can't feel what I feeler 
Be easy on the cut, uh, uh, uh 

This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, this is time to build 

Yeah, fresh on the scene-a with the fucking next niggas demeanor 
You know my work I bless and press more skirts then the cleaners 
I'm damn relaxed cause you cats can't stress the G 
Ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me 
Gone, niggas is moist like Duncan Hienz 
Choice when I'm voicing my poise I got poison lines 
So flame on I turn my game on the expert 
Niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network 
Fuck what you niggas kickin on the mic 
You chicken like you don't know what an ass whippin feels like 
I'm living flashbacks, I blaze niggas split like ass-cracks 
It's the J to the A, smoother than jazz tracks, yeah 
So when I'm browsing through your housing projects 
Niggas get 5,000 shit is rough 
Time to close I hit you with 16 of those 
Next time maybe more, but who the fuck knows? 

This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, this is time to build 

Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo 
I'm peeling niggas caps like oranges 
Hit 'em in the head with 2 by 4 inches 
I'm a grimy nigga so I like my bitches cruddy 
My clothes dirty, dick shitty, and my knife bloody 
I did too much dirt to turn back now 
I'm the reason my lil' sister smoking crack now 
I'd feel guilty if I had a heart but I don't 
To live a carefree life if I stop killing but I won't 
It's in my blood to destroy man kind 
With every murder I lose it little more of my damn mind 
And I ain't got much left to lose nigga ,so don't snooze nigga 
I'm telling yous nigga, just pay your dues nigga 
Respect my mother fucking style of rap 
Murder your mic and your unborn child 
This ain't wild just how niggas living on the street 
A little something that can't be beat 

It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time 
This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, this is time to build 

Recognize, understand, recognize, understand 
Recognize, understand, recognize, understand

Mic Geronimo,"Once in a lifetime, love comes along
And I know it's you that I'm waiting on
And that sweet promise of our first kiss
Keeps me hanging on, through times like this

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

Can't say I know what you look like 
But you're in my heart, you're on my mind
And I feel your love deep down in my soul
When I finally find you, I'll just know

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart

Down to, ""Aight I think it's safe to take off the cuffs"" 
I play wit words, blurs and slurs, flip styles 
Take his and hers, niggaz is couraged, I get wild 
So don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry 
I've got a lot of enemies, and they'd all like to bang me

One guy chose the dogs; left one got froze, filled with holes

Y'all remember, see-M-see, '95 December 
Fine women, illegal tender, such is life 
When I feel like I ain't to be held, who could hold me? 
Hoes try to console me, rec' exec's want to own me 
Damned if I die slowly, drugged out broke and lonely

Look in my eye, you see realness 
The Mobb tonic quest for million, my Lex with ill rims 
My name ringin', chain swingin', ain't richest? 
Are you my heir? Like do we present the same vision? 
My insight is deep, mental intuition 
Type essential, due to this trife life we livin'

Cormega represent a live nigga dynasty 
9's and Tek's, my hollow heads outlined your vest 
My only fear is twenty five years of death

Told me laid back, aced up, to play it mellow

Mic Geronimo,"[Royal Flush]
It was a hot day, fuckin wit shorty round way
Diamond reflected off the white, clear E&J all day
The ennesex pull out the driveway
Feelin like Scarface, desperado on the case
Niggas an ace, celebrate livin it great
Into your mind state, a lock front, but Flush straight
Over wound ya faith, hold it down across state
You know, fitted hat, Tommy shorts to match
Lay back, executioner of rap, that bring stat
Face the phat, tattoo on my arm, and pack gat
Never mind that, quick reflexes, I bust back
Party back to back, New York, where it's at
Hold up stop for a second, bring it back cousin
Let's have a good time, cipher wit the Dutch combine
Respect mine, that's why you live the deaf, dumb and the blind
Bottom line, let's all shine, can't be mad at what's mine
It took a lot to get these props, three shots and almost got rocked
My hustle on the roof top, the watch cop, and I'm gettin crazy cheddar
Drivin rose, Bentleys and better
The street contemplate the terror, the rhymes sever
And overdose speak broadcastin niggas leakin
Probably thinkin, I'm just a wise nigga drinkin

[Chorus 2X]
Whatever you do, you gotta get ya shit straight
No time to wait, make money and regulate

[Mic Geronimo]
While on the mailbox, sit and steamin
Peep the demon, techs were schemin, seen it in they eyes gleamin
Sorta like the shine, 'cept the thoughts son divine
Run wild inside they minds, maybe had somebody by me
My body wit lacerations, cuts, abrasions
Wounds I couldn't slide, from when the bullets started blazin
Awaken from concentration, started to skate
My heart rate, amagortex wit no brakes
Jump the gate, hit the ground on my side, but no pain
Turn around and find her comin like a runaway freight train
And play you, I see blues and cars are too
Choose or lose, ain't no option in my everyday news
Grab the heat and slide, maybe jump up in the ride
Now my nigga Flush, he like lamped on the side
Strictly sorta Cajun, relax, mind lacin
Line cooperation, now to start activation
Ill collaboration, from a team now you facin
We break nation, flew back style afflatus
I only roll daily, wit the God burst heatin
Chill, a mass mill, lay back, leave it dubblin
Money for bubblin, from 95 through recoverin
My crew smotherin, carry Benjamin's and jugglin

Yo, I believe I can fly

Master divisor, colder as I grew wiser
Fool the world like Keyser, see they stuck 85ers
With science, move and use complete silence
Niggas are God recognizin that we run earth with iron
I'm here, but I still ain't seen nobody come near
To the heat so severe it leave you scorched from a flare
Bustin two up in the air, then the rest you got
And God forbid these niggas ever make my hustlin stop
When I drop it's only to put it to excellency status
See, we here to run it all with eight other planets
But I'm on till it's gone, understand it
Performin to the warm hugs and slugs and feel the storm kinda tragic
Magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much
All abuzz how we do it, how we touchin the sky
Holdin more, this is for all of y'all wonderin why
I can fly

Everybody want to be like Mic

Yo, I believe I can fly

Lexus and Benzes every color 
Push a Hummer in the butters
Go to Miami in the summer months 
Crush ice Rolly seemed like my brother once
Chillin on my arm, dippin in my pocket
Hold a 40, Benz inside my palms
Duplexes, east and west coast, plus the flats
Everybody know we get it on like that
With assorted firearm bulletproof to match
Teflon ??? my fitting baseball hat
While my ladies carry .380s in front of they snatch
And we makin all this caper but never givin it back
It's amazin how I put it all together with rap
1000s of listeners everywhere that fall on the map

Bring the flavor to your ear
Appear to make these willies reconsider the fear

Came to talk to you for a minute
You know
I miss you
But I love you
Ain't nobody done for me what you done for me, Ma
You know
So I'ma do this one here for you

Rest in peace
Your son

It woulda been the greatest thing in the world to see
All the possibilities, you made em real for me
In '73 opened me to life itself
Guard my health and went for delf but needed no one else
Allah himself'll only know the reason you're gone
And forever I'ma feel a little pain and mourn
(Life goes on) Now I'm blessed, so I raise each morn
Still I ask every night you help me face the dawn
Pray alone inside a stone-cold confusion and weep
But only your touch can bring me to peace
I can keep a little something of you with me till I reach the end
Till then, let me ask you again, how you been?

[Chorus]
	This is cause I'm thinkin of you
	My love for you will always be true
	You know I'll never forget you for life
	Think of you forever

Sittin recallin how you caught me, how you broke my fall
Heard you scream off in terrors, heard my name you called
All of the lessons you taught me, how this life is war
How to hold till I be sure that I can go for more
Saw me enduring the pain and goin from poor to fame
But livin with more to gain is makin me more insane
It's a strain, I could tell you, you already know
Still I'ma live to tellin you so
And I'm sure you know the way that you was handlin was passed to me
Askin nobody for nothin, so don't ask for me
Look and see how you raised a little nigga to man
It was all just a part of the plan
Daze back as I gaze back lookin at the fact that you left
Funny how I keep hearin footsteps
I keep a little something of you with me till I reach the end
Till then, let me ask you again, how you been?

[Chorus]

If I could leave you off with somethin, it would have to be this
You know I'm gettin through these obstacles, you will be missed
Left a kiss on the forehead, hold through a touch
Now I leave that in the streets from rollin up in a dutch
Ask the Lord to bless the soul of a child if He may
I can only hope that we unite and see you one day
And playback after playback, it wasn't fair
But still and all I never say that, remember here
You got a place inside a nigga, where you end, I begin
Till then, let me tell you again, how you been?

[Chorus]

	Do you know I'm thinking of you, Mama
	Don't you know I think about you all the time

Word... Things ain't what they used to be out here, man
Ain't no more easy living, no more man
You best to recognize, man, it's a struggle out here, man
We forced to do, what we got to do, to survive
It wasn't nothing like this back in the days, man
Word, shit got to change

Verse 1 [Mic Geronimo]
Increasing murders, Three-strike life servers, burners, informers
Guiliani's crews on us
The heat's just like the guns that we bust shot up
Poisoning the little ones, now they grow corrupt
It's different stages, environment got most vision tainted
Murals on the corner, Rest in Peace now a painting
Haters seeing the dehumanization of a being
But worst of all most of y'all don't know what I'm meaning
And strange days, time seems to move so fast
Only concerns is the cash, and a whip to match
See this life is like a bid but it won't do me 
And it's funny nothings really like it used to be, one, two

[Chorus, with Marvin Gaye singing]
Well things ain't what they used to be
4x

Verse 2 [Mic Geronimo]
The epidemics, narcotics, paramedics
Everybody eager at a party just to wet it
And felonies, armed robberies, and sprees
Higher rates on a key, ghetto love disease
More discreetly you choose, who to fucking trust
Nowadays bulletproof, and a Phills a must
Most of us serving, or peeling the yardage on the charges
Incarcerated cut-off from the world, disregarded
Crack babies retardly born, dis-formed
And fathers known for shooting China-White inside they arm
Desert Sickness, planet Earth at it's illest
Strategically the illest, plan a man in specifics
Life is like a bid, but it won't do me
Mentally these are the things that I should not see
And I'm standing here, counting all the casualties
Cause things ain't nothing really like they used to be, one, two

[Chorus] 4x

Verse 3 [Mic Geronimo]
Like a night sky
saw the darker levels, leading teams of rebels
And steaming these streets, just like kettles
Dime minds can rarely walk the concreate, eroded
Playing, I made a folding, off the cards I was holding
Young, Stand between you, from the phantom, ghetto backs drops a cannon
Life at understanding, a maturity stage
Still a thug, and some will stay the same, for most of his days
Flushing to South Jamaica raids, saw the time change hands
Caravans go to MP's after that Lex Lands
And it's bugged just the product of
I came to be, and it's funny nothings really like it used to be, one, two

Mic Geronimo,"You got a minute for your son, Father?
I need to talk I'm so tired of trying to run, Father
Let's take a walk I'm so sorry for what I've done, Father
It ain't my fault The devil's been on my back lately He's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle But it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God
A lot of things that I used to I don't want to
Runnin' the streets like I used ta
I know I'm gonna speak the word for you one day
Up in the light -- Hallelujah!! -- on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife
You have carried me enough times and that's the truth
Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin' to get me

I'm lookin' at life a lil' different now since you hugged me
And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya
Jacob, ascendants, from Africa to Asia
Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had 
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya, 
Thank you Father

Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like

Uh I never knew a love like this before
Messin' with the Thug Life, I missed it all
Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that
One day I'll speak the word
You know that!
When I do, I will be hear
You know that!
You have me a permanent smile

'Cause I'm lonely (for you)

Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keep on, keep on crying baby for you

Everytime you look at me 
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love for me

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time

Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another

Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you know
When I have to tell you so
That I love you then you know

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine

Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts

Bottle of grey goose, you're wearing the same suit
But you don't look as good as you did when you came through
Blunt in your suave shoes, be wearin' the blame truth
They say you and the devil are sharin' the same rooms
That's the very thing that threatens you
Overcome that demon and there's meaning in the methods used
There was never no hell or armada

Is this hotel the perfect place to stay?

'cause I could be the calmest motherfucker you know, or be warned
Have you seen a hurricane em like the eye of the storm?
When my guns are drawn, you're not able to flee
'cause when your lungs are gone you're unable to breathe
I know you hear me, nigga do you feel my words?

Round 2 splatters your mind, this leavin' you dumb

[Guru] 
Now, as I peer through the window of gloom, and everyday living 
And all the hardships one faces to make you give in 
I dig more intensely, finding greater strength 
A lot of heads is empty
I've got a greater rank 
Than emcees not aware of situations 
That'll force one to understand true stipulations 
Thou shalt not bite
Thou shalt not front 
Fake it if you want, but for the battles I've come, 'cause I'm...

[Guru] 
For me this rap life is real life
I don't have to create some false image to make the crowd get hyped 
Too many children get the wrong message from clowns that walk around 
Hopelessly lost, thinkin' that they're the boss 
They're in a daze, while dope emcees don't get the front page 
Me - I try to channel my rage
As I travel through the city regularly 
Turning the anger and frustration straight into energy 
Yes, you will remember me as the brother who cared 
To dare to step up, with his soul bared 
But never fearing 'cause I've got instructions 
From Him, to go and fight the corruption, so I'm...

My granddaddy always told me to keep the light shining 
So as my mic illuminates, you can feel the state that I'm in 
Thoroughly immersed in a verse; way more than hardcore 
I endure 'cause in myself I'm secure 
Delivering syllables and selections with profound perfection 
Comin' back like the resurrection 
In this session, I'm professin', that those who don't 
Hear and understand, never loved me, and so I planned 
To take a stand, as one who is firmly focused 
Plus I'm mad worthy with words 
I rock from East New York all the way to the suburbs 
The lightkeeper, knowledge seeker 
I switch the stress that's on my mind 
Into the voice that rocks your speaker 
And I get deeper than the ocean when I'm...

Fill my need to express myself; like the blues, I can't lose

From my barrage; there's no rescue 
Then I look through the madness, finding sanity 
I'm crazy alert; I never swim in vanity 
I do this rap stuff every year

Mica Paris,"Since back in the day 
We've been close friends 
You would call on me telling me your problems 
I'd been feeling things, things I never said 
When you said that you were in love 
Wish it was me instead 
I'd treat you like an angel 
He treats you like a fool 
When you were hurting baby, I was broken too 
And I can't go on this way 
I need you baby 

[Chorus] 
Tired of being the shoulder you lean on 
Wanna be the one you hold on to 
More than just a friend 
Let me be your everything 
Wish I knew the way to make you 
See that I've fallen in love with you 
Can't you see I love you baby 

If I sit you down, tell you what I'm going through 
Will you leave him? 
Will it be too much for you? 
Don't wanna be an addition 
To your situation 
I never wanna be a complication 
But if I see you cry 
I'm stepping in 
I can't keep watching you get your heart broken 
(I can't go on this way)

[Chorus] 

I ain't never said that I loved you 
More than the friend that put nothin' above you 
And I could be more than the shoulder you lean on 
I could be your king little lady, you'd be gettin' your queen on 
It hurt me everytime I seen him hurt you 
Thinkin' 'bout these feelings got me runnin' in circles 
(I can't go on this way) 
I love your mind, body and soul, and even your perfume 

[Chorus: x 2] 

Whenever you're down, a mess (trouble)
I will be there baby 
I will lift you up when (trouble)

Look over your shoulders honey

I remember
Every tear in your eye

(If I do what I know)
I'd walk back in time
(I will write every wrong)

I would change every line

With The Game, its a goddamn shame niggas can't see that we to blame
For putting Compton to flames, ignite it up
Haters knotted up, when you trip, with canker sores in your whip
That's what I do, to protect my party
My goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy, then its back to shawty
All the ladies drink free, all the players grab a tab
That's how that's supposed to be, drinking Casamigos
Fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now, she so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fires the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first here

So stop that bickering,"" I got a bitch from the
Nickersons that got a fucking bounty on my head, uh ho

Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to

Here am I incased inside a hallow shell
Life began, Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
Living sounds that greet our ears
The sights our eyes befall
We'll open up our merging hearts
And feel our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever

Without despair, we will share
And the joys of care will not be erased
What has been, must never end
The joys of caring will not be replaced
When the seeds of love are plentiful
They won't be hard to find
And the songs of love I sang to you
Will echo in my mind

I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. I said.

Holding and hoping and driving and dreaming
And loving every minute of it
Just enjoying the ride

I've been tooling along the two lane
I got off of the interstate
I'd been going too fast I got off of the gas
I've been learning the charm of the breaks

I've been rolling down all of the windows
I've been letting the world rush in
The smell of the grass in the fields that I pass
And the sun dance on my skin

So I'm taking my time
Holding and hoping and driving and dreaming
And loving every minute of it
Just enjoying the ride
Slowly and soulfully feeling the wheels unwind

È come una marea
È un'onda che va

Un senso d'amore
Tu lo troverai

Il mondo è così grande
E sempre più
Di tutto ci confonde
Che cosa mai

La gioia di un minuto

Vedere nel tuo cuore
E quel candore
Lui lo capirà

Avrà per lui
Il gusto di un tesoro
Che non si può
Compare col denaro
Ti chiederai
Se c'è un più bel regalo
Di tutto l'amore
Che gli lascerai

Lungo la via
Cammineremo insieme
In armonia
Cercando sempre il bene
Lascia che sia

Che vive con noi

Sans savoir quand fermer les yeux

Vous m'avez juste laissé tomber

Espero bajo tu balcon
Y aunque se hiele mi corazon

De tu ventana a mi voz
Ya me falta el aliento
Y yo rompo a cantarte
No para de nevar
Se apaga la ciudad

Y que jamas sobrevivio
A los escombros del corazon
Al dulce beso final

A sweet mystery, as warm as a dream

Alone, alive
Her freedom just meant everything
She made her way
She gently danced till sunrise

Her heart was as warm

As her lavender eyes, yes and

She laughed, she cried
And she loved as she breathed

Que ya no quire recordar
Que se ha cansado de esperar

La lluvia lavo el amanecer
Y el viento borro los besos

Ya no es una obsesion
Solo una sombra, poco mas

Sin que me ciegue la pasion
Pongo aqui el punto y final

"Michael ""Patches"" Stewart","Pretty women
Fascinating
Sipping coffee,
Dancing pretty women
Pretty women 
Are a wonder.
Pretty women!

Sitting in the window or 
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air.

Pretty women
Silhouetted
Stay within you,
Glancing stay forever,
Breathing lightly
Pretty women,
Pretty women!

Blowing out their candles or
Combing out their hair,
Even when they leave
They still are there.
They're there

Ah! Pretty women, at their mirrors,
In their gardens,
Letter-writing,
Flower-picking,
Weather-watching.
How they make a man sing!

Proof of heaven as you're living,
Pretty women! Yes, pretty women!
Here's to pretty women,
Pretty women,
Pretty women,

Michael & the Messengers,"Finding a job tomorrow morning,
Got a little something I want to do.
Gonna buy something I can ride in
Take my girl dating at the drive-in,
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 
I'm gonna buy her pretty presents,
Just like the ones in the catalog.
Gonna show her how much I lover her 
Let her know that one way or the other,
Our love's gonna be written down in history 
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 
Right now I'm speculating,
Wonder what to morrow's gonna really bring.
If I don't find work tomorrow
It's gonna be heartaches and sorrow,
Our love's gonna be destroyed by a tragedy
Just like Romeo and Juliet
 
Talk about love and romance,
Just wait till I get myself straight.
I'm gonna put Romeo's fame right smack dab outta date.

Michael Agee,"My heart belongs to you
You're the happiness I know I can depend on
Been there for me when things go wrong
There's a river full of love I can rely on
 
You and I have faced troubled times before
Because of you I live needing nothing more
Where you are my heart isn't very far  
So promise me now we'll always be forever

Everyday I wake and every night I dream of 
One thing in life I'm sure of
You are the love of my life
Never should there be one moment lived without you
Nothing I'd change about you
You are the love of my life

My life is who you are
All I want to do is simply rest in your arms
You chase away this loneliness
In the middle of the storm I'm lost in heaven

You and I have come through the rains before
Because of you I live wanting nothing more
Where you are my heart can't be very far
So promise me now we'll always be forever

Everyday I wake and every night I dream of 
One thing in life I'm sure of
You are the love of my life
Never should there be one moment lived without you
Nothing I'd change about you
You are the love of my life

You're the summer breeze and yes my inspiration
Song I sing, my salvation, you are the love of my life
Trust me when I say that I can't live without you
You're in my heart, now that we are, forever we'll be

Michael Allen,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Michael Allen,"The problem is
For many years
I've lived my life
Publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And everytime I find someone I like
Gotta worry about
If it's really me
That they see
And I thought you were the one, yeah

Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me, don't think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Michael Allen Harrison,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream","Laura, song (for the film, ""Laura"")",1995

Not for a year but ever and a day

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Only man I ever think of with regret

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Know everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants some crystal magic

Its tricks that on a tempo will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer
How about you with the eyes
Come on down to the front and sit right here and don't be shy
So come one, come all and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghosts or poltergeists
You know I'm no Pinocchio I never told lie
They called me mister magic man
I'm floating cloud nine

Michael B. Tretow,"Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy
Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
The way that you kiss good night
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna hurt you baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey, touch me baby, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me baby, a-ha, honey honey
You look like a movie star (look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are (I wonder just who you are)
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high

There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before (I'd heard about you before)

Michael B. Wailing,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons

Michael Ball,"To dream, the impossible dream
To fight, the unbeatable foe
To bear, with unbearable sorrow
To run, where the brave dare not go

To right, the unrightable wrong
And to love, pure and chaste from afar
To try, when your arms are too weary
To reach, the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
And to fight for the right, without question or pause
To be willing to march into Hell, for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true, to this glorious quest 
That my heart will lie, will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars 
Still strove, with his last ounce of courage 
To reach

And yes I will reach

For all I've been
Blessed with in this life
There was an
Emptiness in me
I was imprisoned by
The power of gold
With one honest touch
You set me free

Chorus:
Let the world
Stop turning
Let the sun
Stop burning
Let them tell me love's
Not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know
Deep in my heart
The only dream that
Mattered had come true
In this life, I was
Loved by you

For every mountain
I have climbed
And every raging
River crossed
You were the treasure
That I longed to find
Without you love
I would be lost

Chorus

In this life,
I was loved by you

Has been walked by better men

Oh mighty love you are
A heavy cross to bear
And it's so unfair

I won't let me drown my emotions
Even though I'd just as soon forget
The voices made the most of the magic

If I'm honest, I knew
I'd never share my whole life with you
You knew it too
When you fall in love
You don't think ahead
You believe whatever said


Chorus:
We break our own hearts
We are to blame
We see the things we want to
We break our own hearts
Time after time
Where have our senses gone to
What it is with people like us
They say it'll change a man
We break our own hearts again.


The night you whispered,
""please stay.""
I couldn't find one reason to say,
""please go away!""
When you feel the sun
You don't dress for rain
Something you just can't... oh... explain


Chorus

We break our own hearts again

Michael Ball,"The sun comes up, I think about you. 
The coffee cup, I think about you. 
I want you so 
It's like I'm losing my mind. 
The morning ends, I think about you. 
I talk to friends and think about you. 
And do they know 
it's like I'm losing my mind. 
All afternoon doing every little chore 
The thought of you stays bright 
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor 
Not going left, not going right. 
I dim the lights and think about you 
Spend sleepless nights to think about you 
You said you loved me 
or were you just being kind? 
or am I losing my mind? 
I want you so... 
All afternoon doing every little chore 
The thought of you stays bright 
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor

Michael Ball,"No man, no madness, 
Though their sad power may prevail, 
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart 
They rise to fail 
She is eternal 
Long before nations' lines were drawn 
When no flags flew, and no armies stood 
My land was born 
And you ask me why I love her 
Through wars, death and despair 
She is the constant 
We who don't care 
And you ask me would I leave her -- but how? 
I cross over borders but I'm still there now 
How can I leave her? 
Where would I start? 
Let men's petty nations tear themselves apart 
My land's only borders lie around my heart

Michael Ball,"Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter. 
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter. 
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade. 
Don't tell me not to fly, I've simply got to. 
If someone takes a spill, it's me and not you. 
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade. 

I'll march my band out! I'll beat my drum! 
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir.

Only I can die once. Right, sir? 
Ooh, life is juicy. Juicy and you see 
I gotta have my bite, sir. 

Get ready for me, love, 'cause I'm a comer. 
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer. 
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade.

Michael Ball,"I dreamed a dream in times gone by 
When hope was high 
And life worth living 
I dreamed that love would never die 
I dreamed that God would be forgiving 

Then I was young and unafraid 
And dreams were made and used and wasted 
There was no ransom to be paid 
No song unsung 
No wine untasted 

But the tigers come at night 
With their voices soft as thunder 
As they tear your hope apart 
And they turn your dream to shame 
 
He slept a summer by my side 
He filled my days with endless wonder 
He took my childhood in his stride 
But he was gone when autumn came 

And still I dream he'll come to me 
That we will live the years together 
But there are dreams that cannot be 
And there are storms we cannot weather 

I had a dream my life would be 
So different from this hell I'm living 
So different now from what it seemed 
Now life has killed 
The dream I dreamed.",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Miserables],1998
Michael Ball,"In a place that won't let us feel
In a life where nothing seems real
I have found you
I have found you
In a world that's moving too fast
In a world where nothing can last
I will hold you
I will hold you

Our lives will change when tomorrow comes
Tonight our hearts drown the distant drums
And we have music all right
Tearing the night

A song
Played on a solo saxophone
A crazy sound, a lonely sound
A cry that tells us love goes on and on
Played on a solo saxophone
It's telling me
To hold you tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world

On the other side of the earth
There's a place where life still has worth
I will take you
I'll go with you
You won't believe all the things you'll see
I know 'cause you'll see them all with me

If we're together that's when
We'll hear it again

They were all I ever knew
Dreams
You won't need when I'm through

Michael Ball,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the the lamp light the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory,all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time i knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every steet lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
someone mutters and a street lamp gutters
and soon it will be morning
Day light, i mustwait for the sunrise
i must think of a new life
and i mustn't give in
when the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
and a new day will begin
burnt out ends of a smokey days

the street lamp dies, 
another night is over
another day is dawning

Around the corner or whistling down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be? Yes, it will maybe just by holding still
It'll be there

And something great is coming

Well I'm moving down the line. 

And it's been so long, 
But I will be there; 
I sing this song 
To pass the time away

Top to toe in tailbacks. 
Oh, I caught red lights on the run, 
Get my feet on snowy ground. 

So I sing for you,

Michael Ball,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow-capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land

How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives

And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway...

What lies waiting down the line

Michael Ball,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds have changed, whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumbled, tossed and torn
This comes to past when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got to feel, you're on solid ground
And for a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting
Waiting for one child, black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child who would grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love, war to peace, everyone to everyone's neighbor
Misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten forever

It's all a dream and illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon, somehow, somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born
This comes to pass when a child is born

Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
They've all gone crazy, mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over themselves to get all of the misery right

No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true

No matter what they call us
However they attack
No matter where they take us

I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know our love forever
I know, no matter what 

If only tears were laughter
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered
Then we would hear God say 

No matter what they tell you 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach you
What you believe is true 

And I will keep you safe and strong
And shelter from the storm
No matter where it's barren
A dream is being born 

No matter who they follow
No matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us
I'll be everything you need 

No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is
My life began with you 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not

No matter what

Michael Ball,"I was standing at the counter
I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a damm had broken in my heart

After taking every detour
Getting lost and losing track
So that even if I wanted
I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I've forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

We were rolling through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along

And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on Earth you are

But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
",The Song Remembers When,2000
Michael Ball,"Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice

Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Baby I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground

But baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

And I boarded the plane 
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues 
In the middle of the pouring rain

Yeah I got a first class ticket 
But I'm as blue as a boy can be 

Then I'm walking in Memphis 
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale 
Walking in Memphis 
But do I really feel the way I feel 

Saw the ghost of Elvis 
On Union Avenue 
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland 
Then I watched him walk right through 
Now security they did not see him 
They just hovered 'round his tomb 
But there's a pretty little thing 
Waiting for the King 
Down in the Jungle Room

They've got catfish on the table 
They've got gospel in the air 
And Reverend Green be glad to see you 
When you haven't got a prayer 
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis 

Now Muriel plays piano 
Every Friday at the Hollywood 
And they brought me down to see her 
And they asked me if I would -- 
Do a little number 
And I sang with all my might 
And she said -- 
""Tell me are you a Christian child?"" 
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

Michael Ball,"The nights grow cold
My search for gold is leading nowhere
Whichever lonely road I take it seems to go where
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow

How can I display
What I know I'm worthy of
When they turn me away. 

The doors are closed to such as I
A Boy from Nowhere
But not to those who merely buy the right to go where
There'll be men with respect not humiliation 

A man's place on earth
I have come to realise is decided by birth. 

So what's the future?
No matter where I go
I will still belong
In Andalusia 
Where we don't know where the next penny's coming from -
Something's wrong 

I vow to Spain, I won't remain a Boy from Nowhere
There has to be a place for me and I must go where 

I don't fantasise, like a million others
Not a man alive
Had to beg or steal or fight for the need to survive 

So what's the future?
No matter where I go, I will still belong
In Andalusia 
The good honest men grow weak and the rich grow strong
Something's wrong 

Another dawn, another morn
A Boy from Nowhere
My destiny will guarantee that I must go where
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow
One more mouth to feed
And the way things are round here
That's the last thing they need

When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away

It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

Heightens each sensation
Darkness wakes
And stirs imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I compose the music of the night 

Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes 
And embelish on your darkest dreams,
Purge all thoughts of the life you knew before,
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live like you've never lived before

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night 

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world,
leave all thoughts of the world you knew before,
let your soul take you where you long to be,
only then can you belong to me. 

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night 

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
