Frehley's Comet,"Now I know, you've been cheatin' and lyin' all the time
I didn't know you were gonna be so unkind
I've been trying just to find out how we went wrong
But I know that I can't trust you girl anymore

Rip it out, take my heart, you wanted it from the start
You got it now, so goodbye, so rip it out, watch me cry

It's so bad, I'm not glad to be with you today
And it's bad, 'cause I can't stop the pain day by day
If I knew how to stop you, I don't think I'd try
I think it's better if we just part and don't say goodbye
I hope you suffer!",Rip It Out,1988
Frehley's Comet,"Lady Space, she's like the way I make you feel inside
Take a rocket ride
From the start she wanted to fly
I got the rocket and you want the ride, take a rocket ride

Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride

Lady Space, you better wake up fast
The countdown is comin' on, take a rocket ride
The gravity that used to hold you down
Just don't exist no more, take a rocket ride

Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride

Now grab a hold of my rocket

Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride

Baby's on her knees, baby wants to please
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby's on her knees, baby wants to please
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride

She wants a rocket ride",Rocket Ride,1988
Frehley's Comet,"You know that something's out there 
Just like those things under the bed 
A fear you know when younger, 
Sometimes, made up in your head

But it ain't no apparition, 
Won't pull things down into the rug 
You wish that you could wake up 
But both pinch and the pin, they draw blood 

(And) something moved, it's out there 
Someone knows you're there 

Your eyes are dead and broken 
Fixed in a stare without a blink 
You see but don't believe it 
Like a whine swearing off a drink 

You live in fear for daybreak 
Some warmth and comfort from the sun 
All sense of time escapes you 
'Cause when you look up at the clock, it's only one 

(And) something moved, it's out there 
Someone knows you're there",Something Moved,1988

Frehley's Comet,"Frozen fingers on a coco wheel 
Hot emotions that you can't conceal 
Stay on the freeway 
Take the chance of your life 

Screamin' sirens cryin' in your ear 
Flashin' red lights burnin' in tthe mirror 
Come on step on it 
Get them out of your sight

Can't be too cool, when you're dancin' with danger!

Frehley's Comet,"Some people call me a walkin' disaster 
Just a waitin' for a place to occur 
But I still got enough that'll last her

My meter's running, still got a lot of livin' to do 
I live five days to your one 
And you know it's true, yeah! 

[Chorus]
(Listen!) I got money, got fame 
Got everything ot play this game 
No sorrow, no shame 
'cause nothin' matters when you're insane!

It's never easy being the crazy 
Just a job someone's got to do 
Take a number and stand in the line 
For the good life you never knew

Frehley's Comet,"You were life and love upon this island 
And it was hard but you made it all worthwhile 
So afraid that I'm gonna run away 
Well if I was, I wouldn't be here today, ay 
And you took me by the heart 
And showed me where I was 
Deep inside your love 

[Chorus]
(You will) Never here me say the words 
Never feel the pain that hurts 
Never hear me say 
It's over now 

I look at you, and I see there's a fear 
Something's wrong but your holdin' back your tears 
Well here is where I am and where I'll stay

You gotta be yourself 
And follow your dreams

Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Don't let them say, say that you're bad 
Don't let them call you a juvenile delinquent 
Just follow your dreams, you'll never be sad 

You ain't a kid no more 
Adolescence behind 
You're lookin' good these days 
Believe me, girl! 
I'm not blind 
Now there's no turnin' back 
Baby, you've made up your mind 
It's time to stand your ground 
You know that you've turned the tide

Frehley's Comet,"He's got a holster 
Filled up with grief 
I wouldn't want to cross his line 
I'd end up underneath

Shoot off both your knees

Recently pleased 

You don't want to cross wits 
Better not try 
You couldn't learn his limits 
And you don't have the mind 


Loser in a fight 
Loser in a fight 
Better learn to run 
Your winnin' days are done 

He's a thinker you can see it 
Sometimes the eyes don't lie 
And if your head is empty 
He'll make your body die 
I don't need his aggravation 
I'm better than the rest 
Better stand up or shut up

Frehley's Comet,"Can't stop tossin' and turnin' at night 
It gets harder each day, fighting with this feeling inside 

You can swear that you love me 
By every star in the sky 
But when you're close to me 
You get that look in you eye 
A burning feeling, you just can't disguise 

[Chorus]
Words are not enough, to make me feel like a man in love 
Words are not enough, to make me feel like a man in love 

We need each other its easy to see 
You know I'm shaking all over thinking how good this could be

But when you're in my arms 
The words starts spinning and we lose all track of time 

[Chorus]",Words Are Not Enough [Studio],1988
Frehley's Comet,"Walking urban streets and we got ourselves a gun 
Thinking about our lives and the shape, shape, shape 
Shapes of things to come 

Ducking down the alleyways of fear 
A hungry cat calls and he knows, knows, knows 
Knows the end is near 

Now we can't take it no more 
We'll smash down society's walls 

Bad Boys are comin' its too late to cry 
Better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye 
Bad Boys are comin' its too late to cry 
Too fast to live too young to die 

Listen little darlin' I said you'll never understand 
Our times running out in this jungle land 
Clock strikes twelve and the wind begins to moan 
Shivers down our spines and there's no returning home 

Now we can't take it no more 
Were gonna rip down society's walls",2 Young 2 Die,1989
Frehley's Comet,"Hot summer's gone and you're still ready to burn

Anticipation mixed with desire 
No one can stop you cause your heart's on fire 

Back, back to school 
I'll teach you all the things that you never knew 
'Cause it's back to school for you 

Now I 'm the teacher but I have no degree 
Forget the rest I'll teach you biology 
Now just relax and you'll do your best 
Concentrate and you'll pass the test

Frehley's Comet,"In this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air
Hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you.

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
Woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That i've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya want my love
Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love",Do Ya,1989
Frehley's Comet,"I was born the son of a car shark 
With a deck in my hand 
I'm the best at playing the game 
I'm known throughout the land 

At the tables you'll find me 
A stack of chips by my side 
Poker Gin or 21 
A wining hand is my pride 

Just cut the pack 
I'll take the one-eyed Jack 
There's no holding back 
I call your bluff 

It ain't no crime 
Winning all the time 
The money's on the line 

I play for blood 
I'm the five card stud 

Don't try to con me 
Let's get it understood 
You'll never get one past me 
I know every trick in the book 

I'll play you double or nothing 
If you think you're so good 

Lets go for broke 
Afraid you're gonna choke 
Got one slim hope 
That ain't enough 

Well you're outta luck 
Lost your bottom buck 
I hit a royal flush 
And I smell blood 
I'm the five card stud",Five Card Stud,1989
Frehley's Comet,"Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire, his fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars, it was no big deal
Rosa had streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown, Johnny better run, better run
 
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire
 
The ride was over but the story doesn't end, he took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone, it was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run
 
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire
 
Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night, as time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands, with nothing won
When someone lies dying, lovers finally understand
 
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire",Hide Your Heart,1989
Frehley's Comet,"The party's over in the morning light 
My head is spinning lost my appetite 
Barking dog much too loud 
Chuck him a bone and get me out of this town 

Voices I hear I can't explain 
Those neon lights they hurt my brain 
Feeling no pain my body's numb 
From Hell's kitchen to Kingdom Come 

Not feeling happy not feeling sad 
Not feeling anything good or bad 
I'm not in Heaven I'm not in Hell 
This must be limbo now can't you tell 

Not feeling happy not feeling sad

Frehley's Comet,"Well I'm staring down from Venus in the dead of night 
My mind is thinking back to when the world was right

And people keep on starving and you think that's just fine

With my head in the clouds its easy to see 
You better live together peacefully 
You know the world is still your family 
So keep it straight, remember me 
It's not too late, remember me 

Well I'm floating and spinning and flying 
above the Earth's atmosphere 
And I've got a few things to say 
That you may not want to hear 

Now there's just enough time to repair it 
As long as you don't let it get you down 
But there's not a whole lot you can do for yourself 
when you're buried underground 

[Chorus]

There's so much yelling an screaming 
and lying and cheating 
and robbing and preaching 
That we've heard it all

And helping each other 
Or we're gonna fall 

And that'll be all

In Reih und Glied und Händchen haltend
Wird getreten und geschossen

Bevor du ins offene Messer rennst

Falsche Motivation
Auf nacktem Arsch durch unser Feuer
Gibt rote Backen und heiße Ohren
Verstehe doch, du bekriegst die Falschen
Und bist zudem genau so schlimm

Hast dich wohl im Ziel geirrt?
Kein Schuldspruch, kein Verbot

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

Throw about 20 grand in the air, told her walk up on that green
Talkin' pop that, blunt rolled, cup full, getting big
Started from a dollar, now I'm making M's

This the remix!

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (Turn Up!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti

I woke up in a new Bugatti
Tats all over my body
Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me
Man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga
Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Fresh, whips
Candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich
Put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions
Stunna island, we packin'
Rich gang, we uptown
Nigga hardbody and mackin'
Tool on that back, nigga
Money and that power
Mansion on that beach, nigga
Blood red Bugatti
Versace on my bitch, nigga
Blow a mil' like it's a dollar

I woke up in a new Bugatti (This the remix!)

Woke up with the crown nigga
Serving Bobby Brown nigga
Started from the bottom now it's Carter, Nino Brown nigga
Take my spot nigga never will
Now I know how 'melo feel
We both shooters from New York
But I shown nigga how the metal feel
Fidel Castro with them cuban links
With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick, nigga

[Chorus]
Better know who you is
When you looking in the mirror
'Cause everything that glitters
It ain't gold
I'm getting low, from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happening
Ridin' with my niggas
'Cause everything that glitters, that ain't gold
I'm gettin low, hold me from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted one kept owing
For every bitch I showed the way it's one that kept hoe'in
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and the tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lions
The news you read can be you, ghetto law abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies you and your soul can't see it clearer

[Chorus]

I just can't leave it alone
I just can't leave it alone
They handing out football numbers after tapping your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome
Took a brick then I turned it to stone
Five into ten the return of the clones
Then took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned em to Boeing's
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Lost a lot of niggas, some in club fed
Few still reminiscing in they CL,
Sellin' Pete rock cruisin' in they V twelve

Oh this the moment they feel ya?
We back on our get down
You see what it is
So lay down, Bad Boy, Blood Line
Get up, talk to 'em

I got tats all on my arm,
Racks on racks in the bank
Forgiatos on my Range, Pepsi blue my paint
All these girls be choosy,
Can't find a bitch who ain't
Haters they out ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' wit my whole crew, ball
Hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, ball
Make it rain we don't give a fuck
'Bout what you say, I do this every day
Don't buy bottles, buy bottle case
Seem like every night my birthday
I can't help but get the cake

Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Live it up and just for fallin' out

Tattoos on my neck, half a mill in my car
Dream team I rap, just me and my dogs
Straight cash in that haircut
Sea Bass and that lamp chop
Met her at the bar
Tryin' to get some head shots
62 that Maybach, fake jewels don't play that
Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6
Never hit that red zone, baby I was airborne
Hoppin' out that Ghost
Sippin' red dot with a red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population
And I'm never fakin' Jacks,
You know I'm poppin' Aces
I'mma ball, Illuminati bank rolls
Suicidal Lan' doors, and two Italian tan hoes

Like 90thou in my denim
Told a bitch I just met,
Write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi,
Got these niggas buyin' large lead
Bout to take my LA crib
And drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game,
Like Peach Ciroc and champagne
You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets,
And I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes
This passion and pain fashion,
Matchin' my things catchin'
Action from things mackin',
Then flashin' my rings captain
Twin V's, thin tires, envy my entire
Catalogue, but don't have the heart
'Cause real kings build empires
Everything that I said nigga
Was everything that you saw
I did everything that I claim,
You ain't like us 'cause we ball

They're wondering how I get these mills and still live like a stoner
No other way, I get a 100k from each promoter
Or more than that, hold up
Money long it don't fold up

Them diamonds yellow them beams are red
And them hands tucked, they don't show
Plus them shooters with me got the green light
So why the fuck you don't think they won't go?
Hold up, your chick traded post game
And it's no shame she felt your man
She probably on Joe Johnson
'Cause I don't never be on that Elton Brand
It's YSL, she's fly as hell

You can't blame hoes ain't Peter Rose
Now she a thorn in my side, grow up

Slipped inside the Mirror, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks

I’m hung low to all these women, I’m their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don’t want them mislead
So it’s a sign by my bed that say “No turn on red”
Treating women like spades, I’m so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I’m possible

Nothing penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all

Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine until it's even keel

See you when they free you cuz 'cause I ain't coming back no more
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back and forth
Knowing if a nigga violate that I be back in court
Reside in somebody's federal estate

Been through shit that make you cry, have you choking up
Find yourself in the darkest places loading them nines
Tryna grip your mind, searching, you search what you find

Now your conscience is clear

In the morning when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think than I can be so willed
And never do what you say
I'll never hear you
And never do what you say

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun the people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile and pause to free

I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

Read them good and well

People have got to sell

Frenchie Burke,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1999
Frenchy Burrito & the Folk Pistols,"Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said you've got to go back,
You know they didn't even give us a chance.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honeymooning down by the Seine.

Peter Brown called to say,
You can make it OK,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed,
I said we're only trying to get us some peace.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.

Last night the wife said,
Oh boy, when you're dead you 
Don't take nothing with you but your soul think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

The newspapers said,
She's gone to his head,
They look just like two Gurus in a drag.
Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.

The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Caught the early plane back to London,
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me",The Ballad of John and Yoko,2003
Frenchy Burrito & the Folk Pistols,"We had an apartment in the city.
Me and my husband liked living there.
It's been years since the kids have grown,
a life of their own, left us alone.

John and Linda live in Omaha.
Joe is somewhere on the road.
We lost Davy in the Korean war.
I still don't know what for, don't matter any more.

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
""Hello in there. Hello""

Me and my husband, we don't talk much anymore.
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.

Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, ""Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do.""

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
ah, but, but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
""Hello in There. Hello.""

So if you're walking down the street sometime
and you should spot some hollow ancient eyes,
don't you pass them by and stare
as if you didn't care.
Say, ""Hello in there. Hello.""",Hello in There,2003

But she'd go in time, and leave me to cry again, oh no
What can I do, 'cause I, I'm feelin' blue

I can't choose, it's too much to lose when our love's too strong
Maybe if she would come back to me, then I can't go wrong

It's time, it's time, that I felt peace of mind, oh oh

Sweet seventeen with a faraway look in her eyes

She said, ""I feel like a bird in a cage
Come September I'm flying away""
And I said, ""I'm gonna miss you""
Then I made her promise to write

Since we were tall as the corn in the spring
We shared every secret, shared every dream
So anxious to grow in the new summer rain
And bloom like a rose on the Calico plains

How could she hear as we laughed
On that warm summer night
The tiny heart of the baby, she carried inside

I stood beside her when September came
Watched her get married and caught the bouquet
And like those hand me down dresses she gave me
I made her dreams mine

From a seat by the window on wings made of steel
I stared at the patchwork over the fields
Where young tears that once fell like warm summer rain
Were turning to snow on the Calico plains

Sweet Abilena looks out at the midwestern sky
Closer to thirty but farther away in her eyes
She holds her babies like she holds her dreams
Each night she kisses and rocks them to sleep
While she reads the letters, she makes me promise to write

I may have lost my self-respect but I've still got my pride.
I would steal a car but I don't know how to drive.
The common law that binds us and that keeps us in place

Legal. That's just not.
I would take a cricket bat to a jewellery store
That's if I had a spine and it was within the law

I would give you the keys to the whole shopping mall.
I would take a cash machine and run down the street

I'm afraid it's a fact that I'm inherently weak

And that's just not legal.
I turn on the T.V. as I switch of my head
I wonder should I go out or just rot here in bed

most things seem to have them from an insect to a whale.
Genitals are funny, they're so funny.
Some people of the moral christian right
they fail to see the joke when adam and eve
removed their fig leaves.
The holocaust would have turned out incredibly
differently if on that dark night Hitler was
pantsed on sight.
And if you can't understand or read the humour in
what I just wrote why don't you take a long hard look
at some testes or a scrote (um)
Genitals are funny, they're so funny.

Some folk amusement from the telling
of sexest jokes, they think they're a clown
while they put people down.
Why is it that what we're born with is perceived
as awfully crude, would anything be rude if
we were always nude.

All the attention that it brings
Tell me no, I say yes, I was chosen
And I will deliver the explosion

Can't say it's gonna get me far
Do no good to say what you are
I run the streets and I break up houses
River runs deep and the flame devours it

Me, I'm a Creator
Thrill is to make it up
The rules I break got me a place
Up on the radar
Me, I'm a Taker
Know what the stakes are
Can't roll it back, it's understood
Got to play our cards

Sit tight I know what you are
Mad bright but you ain't no star
Polish up 'til you make it gleam
Your M.O, I know what you mean
Tail ridin' and I know it's true
While they screamin' I love you
Down deep you know there ain't no flow
A soul decay, was D.O.A

I know what you here for now
Words out you're an idea whore though,
Now don't you crush on me
I'll see you in your pipe dreams
Whether or not you know it's true
You're who they dictate to
That shit must hurt real bad
Fakin' what you wish you had

Here all the folks come ask about me
Band wagon, know they used to doubt me
Blind side tend to hit real hard
You should heed the warning, get a body guard
Steady friction in this bitch
Creepin' in just like an itch
So far I got the last laugh
Still the rich rise up, still I live fast
Wouldn't know it face to face
Got no soul and got no taste
Moving in speed up the pace
I got it locked though, what a waste
All the talk is standard fare
Walk the walk if it gets you there
On the grind 'til the gig is up
I'm 'a smash 'em down
Put a muzzle on them like ""what!""",Creator,2008

Ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh

I was taught that talk is cheap
And I have learned that love is deep
God gave me my soul to keep
So I talk love a whole big heap
And I will not point a finger
For it is timeless and will linger
I keep my own words down so I won't drown
Repeat one more time and don't hinder

Some people might be wondering
Is his head in the clouds and no ground under him
What the so and so's he on about
So I'll just break it down
I got up out of bed one misty morning
Found myself sitting there and brainstorming
About how to be true without being corny
Had to do some soulstorming
Must be the benefit of the global warming
I realized that there ain't no harm in
Planting soul and a little farming
Do some soul farming
Soul, soul

Tout seul dans ce décor
Qui brille de bas en haut
Oh rappelle moi
Qu'ici et même ailleurs
La vie est un trésor
Le temps nous promet trop

Et même ce soir
Perdu sous ces lumières
Qui brillent dans le miroir
Où s'écrit cette histoire
Je me rappelle
Qu'ici et même ailleurs
Ma vie, mon heure de gloire
Le temps trop illusoire

En attendant
Que vienne, vienne l'heure
L'instant que sais-je encore
Pour briller tout là-haut
Que tout revienne
Comme éclat de lumière
Oh rappelle moi encore
Qu'autour de nous, là-haut

Je m'en irai
Aussi léger que l'air
Me perdre dans le décor
Et briller tout là-haut
Comme un rappel
Pour les prochains hivers
La vie est un trésor
Le temps nous promet trop",Sous les Étoiles/Outro,2015

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Fresno,"Às vezes fico com saudade
De momentos que eu ainda não vivi
Às vezes peco na vontade
De sentimentos que eu ainda não senti

Te vejo nas paredes dos hotéis
Eu vivo interpretando papéis
Às vezes não sei mais quem sou
Me deu vontade de voltar

Pois eu sei, que você quer viver comigo outra vez
Que você quer viver ao lado meu, até a luz do sol se apagar

Eu exagero nas palavras
Mas nos meus versos eu só encontro você
(Eu saio só pra te ver)

É só mais um dia de chuva e eu vou pra redenção
Pois amanhã já vou estar em outro lugar
Muito longe daqui, muito longe de ti

Pois eu sei que você quer viver comigo outra vez
Que você quer viver ao lado meu, até a luz do sol se apagar
Eu sei
(Eu sei que você)
Que você quer viver comigo outra vez

Fresno,"Fiquei tentando decorar, o que eu ia dizer
Quando a gente se encontrar
E quando eu ver você
Mas as palavras vão faltar e eu vou ficar
Fingindo que não é nada demais

Tem tanta coisa pra falar, dizer que eu sofri
Estando em todo lugar, sem ter você aqui
Mas não tem como evitar
Todo esse tempo longe só me fez te querer mais

Nesse lugar, a gente pode enxergar
A mais distante das estrelas
Nesse lugar, ninguém jamais vai nos achar
Tudo o que eu quero é ficar pra sempre aqui

E o que fazer se o plano não funcionar?
Se a caminhada é em vão?
Quem é que vai me guiar andando na escuridão?
Não posso mais esperar!

É ficar pra sempre aqui, com você",Nesse Lugar,2010

E de longe eu não posso te ver
Então me perco em pensamentos de um passado
Que há muito tempo eu quero esquecer

Eu só quero falar que ao teu lado
Eu tava errado, eu nunca consegui viver
Mas só eu sei de você

Só não queria dizer adeus
(É que eu tinha tanto pra contar)

Eu não queria dizer
Eu volto há tanto tempo e cada vez
Parece que o meu tempo não passou
Eu não encontro nada que me dê motivo

Outra vez pra procurar o que sobrou
Eu vivo condenado e sem saída
De um passado que parece não ter fim
Você não sabe de mim

Só não queria dizer adeus
(É que eu tinha tanto pra cantar)

Eu não queria perder o que sempre foi meu
Pois não há alguém que possa te amar
Pois não há alguém que possa nos salvar

O que a gente vai fazer quando se ver, de novo?
O que será que acontece pra gente, um dia, não se querer mais?

Eu sou o que eu queria ser quando crescer
E eu me enxergo em todo lugar, exceto aonde você está
O mundo ao meu redor é estranho, agora que eu já não te tenho mais
Eu só queria Mas eu nem sei mais

Então escolha de que lado vai jogar
Pois, ao meu lado, está sobrando um lugar
Ele é seu Eu sou seu
Então me diga onde é que você está
No meu passado, você não pode ficar
Acabou, acabou

O que o mundo vai dizer, quando o amor vencer?
Em quem a gente vai pensar quando a luz se apagar?
Eu quero um segundo
De silêncio, será que é pedir demais? Não
Eu só queria, mas eu não sei mais como é você

Eu sei, eu já tentei fugir

Eu Quero viver mais

Eu Quero dizer mais

Você achou que eu tinha desistido
Não estou morto, apenas fui ferido
E, eu sei (eu sei que o tempo acabou)

Trancafiado nesse quarto escuro
Ainda assim me sinto mais seguro
Eu sei, e é longe de você

Eu Quero viver mais
Muito além do que você programou
Eu Quero dizer mais
Ao fim de tudo, que o teu tempo acabou
Quero sentir

Mit meinem Mann Sèkou aka The Ambassador 
Für 1999 
Und wir haben viel Liebe zu geben 
Check it out now 
Yo 'Kou, drop the verse 

There comes a time in your life you've got to go against the odds 
Take pause, try to get from small to large 
It's all good, struggle through and knock on wood
I might not have always done things the way that I should
Nor the way that I could now, grow to know how
Keep it on the low focus y'all brothers pow wow
Watch the hour I'm on some next moves for tomorrow 
Still my sunshine that's how we blossom the flowers 
Lost ones on the bottom hardly ever seen light
That's why the spark trouble, always starting the fight 
Walking up on my boys making noise and shit 
Talking 'bout FK how they hate my clique 
I never throw fits stay calm never alarmed 
That's how we last long, keep my life line in my palm
Yo, Don, turn the mic up, focus the view 
Ambassador write songs the whole world relate to

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me up when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart, all apologies 

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me out when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart all apologies

Yo, I grew up fatherless like most black males
It's like the whole lot of us is programmed to fail
But in the end new beginnings get it started again
God's speed lead your thoughts back to deep within
Keep my feet on the ground, watch who lingers around
A lot of hard luck niggas try to get at my crown
But I forgive them send 'em love I know what it's like
Doing shows for no dough and if the ends ain't right
So it's a must we bond and we can all cop this
You do for me I do for you we both top of the list
Wath your stock once you got it, set up shop
Keep your eyes on the clock plus stick to your plot
You may never be a rich star but I know who you are
And that will take you much further than your jewels and your car
We all got a lot to give so take heed to the song
'Cause I'm going to live what I say to the day that I'm gone

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me out when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart all apologies

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind

One love one heart all apologies

Yeah yeah 
We've all come a long way since it started 
Maximilian, DJ Friction, The Don (stay strong)

I took my time wrote it down line for line 
Take a look and you'll find truth lies in a wise rhyme
I watch the sky, follow signs of the magi 
Heard the most high that be the words of my third eye
Spoke with fire, lift this bloke out of the mire
Make it known I only quote those I admire 
My sole objective to spawn growth and inspire
Move across the globe like a soldier for hire
So long it's for a just cause we can spark to the cypher
Talk politics to the day we spot Elijah 
Could have sworn it I saw him rise on the hills of Israel
So reveal your true size and know if it's real
We no longer have to wonder where we got our next meal
The whole squad got stronger now we on even keel
Enough said we could break bread and all get fed
So take it as a compliment and let it go to your head 

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me out when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart all apologies

Sie gab mir diese Adresse, hoff' der Brief kommt an
Bist du wieder in Marseille? Ich hör' die Tour war lang
Anbei n'dat, vielleicht machen wir'n Tune zusamm'
Wir basteln an der neuen Platte in der Bude vom Don
No sé Studio One, und es wär cool wenn du kommst
Vielleicht im Januar, kurz nach Hannukah
Four zahlt das Ticket, Günne checkt das Business mit Fabian
Das Konzept ist Briefwechsel, und da du auch eher bildlich textest
Sag ich lieber nicht zuviel zu Message
Stuttgart ist nicht Marseille, doch Menschen teilen Schicksal
Die gleichen Stigmas, die gleiche Politik samt gleichem Ritual
Man führt seinen täglichen Kampf, in seiner Welt gefangen
Schnell ist der Horizont nur noch der eigene Tellerrand
Shurik'n ich hoff du hast Visionen für das
Lass es mich bald wissen schreib' zurück
Gruß, Max

Yo Max j'ai bien reça ta missive j'ai quelques idées prècises
On peut faire un bon truc pour moi c'est cool pour moi ça y est j'déboule
Je pense que pour le sujet il n'y aura pas de problème
J'ai déjà noté quelques phrases sur feuille j'sais que tu fais de même
Et peut-être qu'on écrit les même après tout le malin joue
La même pièce partout chaque fois il change de scène c'est tout
On doit subir les mêmes préjugés la même méfiance
Les mêmes contrôles musclés de merde qui t'gâchent la journée,2
Le même silence je sais on doit se coltiner les mêmes cons qui n'aiment que la
Main culte
Et ceux qui pour un billet de cent sans regret te buttent je lutte
Mais la certitude persiste triste constat m'incite à rester incisif pour pas que
Je ramolisse
Je le dois à ceux qui m'ont fait et ceux qui font ce que j'suis
Un chroniqueur d'époque un observateur un narrateur féroce
Je peins des tranches de vie sur toile crue au couteau
C'est mon taf mec ma fonction mon hiphop mon bastion

This is my letter to a brother
Opinion of another

Daily struggles, we all face the same trouble
Remain humble through these stages of life, we all grow
It's like the next mans vice may as well be your own
We all share the same globe so let it be known

Je brûle un cierge un d'plus pour un jeune gus un d'plus
Encore un qui ira pas jusqu'au terminus que dire de plus
Les choses arrivent tout le monde proteste mais personne ne bouge et
On regarde sa montre et un surin perce le sol vire au rouge
Et merde tu passes ta vie à vouloir sortir de la nasse
Hélas des coups de crasse affluent la poisse ...
Plein d'vices j'ouvre l'oil le bon fils et j'm'exprime avant qu'on m'opprime
Je rime je rime j'apporte ma pierre à l'édifice fils
Facile, faut que tu bosses mec les choses
Se gagnent pas comme ça faut que tu oses mec en bas il y a pas de hasard
Y'a des envieux des jeunes qui touchent à tous les jeux dangereux
Et s'ils sont chanceux après deux trois pétards ils rêveront à mieux
Pendant c'temps là les mères frisent la crise et les bizz
N'arrangent rien quand la grande porte grise se referme
On se retrouve sans les siens
Son sang qu'on le sente dans mes écrits c'est ce que je sais faire
Croisir le fer avec l'esprit j'espère être pris pour être compris

Sondern das Leben der Rakai teilen daran partizipieren
Die Wahrheit besingen, in den Geschichten, die ihr Leben schreibt
Und Arglist ans Licht bringt bei jeder Gelegenheit
Ich bin nicht aus'm Banlieue, wohn' eher schön
Bin nicht vom Tod umgeben, doch wurd' erzogen hinzusehn'
Die Welt nicht hinzunehm' während Unrecht passiert
Schnell lebst du deinem Ego und bist uninteressiert
Gibst deine Stimme zur Wahl und meinst du kannst jetzt verstummen
Wir brechen die Omerta, noch ist Schweigegeld nicht Landeswährung
Nimm das als Erklärung, warum wir Briefe wechseln
Iam und FK stehn für progressive Texte

MCs kommen mit miesen Skills
Beats poison wie Fliegenpilz
Mal seh'n was du von diesen hältst
Mit dem Boom eines Minenfelds
Langsam aber wohlbedacht
Wir rennen niemals der Mode nach
Hier wird's den ander'n vorgemacht

Für die Kids da draußen
Die mit dem Shit down sind
Zu dem Beat bouncen
Bis sie taub sind wie Pete Townsend
Das ist kein Sound für VIP Lounge
Koksnasen und Pillenfresser
Das hier ist dicker wie Nana
Mouskouris Brillengläser
Macht dich willenloser
Wie BILD-Leser
Also chill besser

Oh nein, das Leben ist kein Witz
Aber mir vergeht das Lachen nicht
So verkaufen die Platten sich hoffentlich
Wenn ich es alles so fett gebacken krieg
Wie es mir schmeckt
Auch wenn es ein Rezept für die Massen gibt
Auf'n smoothen oder roughen Beat
Noch geschickter als ein Taschendieb

Sind tight wie Leggings

Ist weil Freunde bleiben, während Träume vorbeiziehen
Und weil sich Leute das reinziehen sind wir mehr als nur uns selbst verpflichtet

Freundeskreis,"Estu kore bonvenaj por la dua albumo de Amikaro
Sub la titolo “Esperanto”
Verdire, Esperanto estas la dua lingvo de simplaj homoj
Sian strukturon ĝi havas el diversaj lingvoj de Eŭropo
Pro sia simpla strukturo, ĝi estas facile lernebla
Ĝi deziras progresigi la interkomprenon de popoloj
Sur la nivelo de respekto kaj egalaj rajtoj
Por Amikaro, Esperanto sinonimas kon hiphop
Kiel lingvo, respektive kulturo de la internaciisma junularo
Ankaŭ, la urbeca germana lingvo evoluas precipe en la liriko de hiphop
Kiu entenas multe da specifaj terminoj de la afroamerika junularo
Sed akceptas ankaŭ vortojn kaj parolturnojn de la emigrintoj ĉi-tie vivantaj

Check uns und unsere lieder in der bundesliga
Es geht drunter und drüber weil plötzlich jeder nach oben will

Lass mich nicht festnageln ich kann mit recht sagen
Wir fahren seit jahren die gleiche schiene wie s-bahn
Rollen mir hiphop heute wie gestern weil wir vernetzt sind
Und so bleibt es erst mal denn wer will uns schädigen

Auf dem Makadam Partisan die Uhr schlägt Rosch ha-shana 'ne neue Zeit bricht an
Astrologen beschwör'n das Zeitalter des Wassermann
Kein Stern am Firmament, das Pentagramm kreuzt den pentagon'schen Masterplan
Aus den weiten Kasachstans bis in die Höhen der Golan
Erklingt die Stimme der Massen righteous wie Rastachants
Philister müssen gehen sie ham' zu lange abgesahnt
Nehmt Ministern die Diäten daß sie fasten wie an Ramadan
Bald werden Köpfe rollen, weil jetzt andere an die Töpfe wollen
Auch aus dem vollen schöpfen wollen ihr'n Tribut nicht falschen Götzen zollen
Weil der Tanz um's goldene Kalb nicht ungescholten bleibt
Weil schon die Luft zu verschmutzt ist als daß man Schlösser in die Wolken träumt
Bald stürmen 144 mit geballter Faust
Von Gibraltar aus das europäische Haus
Und vor den Straßen behrings fegt ein Zauberlehrling
über Flora und Fauna des amerikanischen Traumas
Und sie holen sich was ihr's ist, treten über babylonische Ufer wie Euphrat und Tigris
Boykottieren das Business wo der Teufel im Spiel ist
Bis es ertrinkt wie Osiris in den Fluten der Krisis
Der Schein trügt, denn das Harte unterliegt
So wie das Wasser in Bewegung mit der Zeit den Stein besiegt
So sind die Massen in Bewegung nur so gewaltsam wie ihr Flußbett
Das Konzept bleibt verkrustet und wenn sie's reformieren wie Chruschtschow
Wenn auch in euern Adern Blut kocht steigt mit in die Barkassen
Man soll die Welt sehn wie sie ist aber muß man sie so lassen?
Rap ist Sprachrohr, begleitet Aufruhr textlich
Das Große spiegelt sich im Kleinen, das ist Dialektik
Denn das Musikgeschäft ist nur ein Bildnis für die Wildnis
Wenn du gewillt bist zu partizipier'n wo das schnelle Geld ist
Akzeptierst du das Verhältnis das auf der Welt herrscht
Kapier das auch wenn du das System hofiert hast
Der Unterschied zwischen Musikern und Proletariern
Ist wir verkaufen uns momentan profitabler
Und ich mim' ihn' Don Quichote in ihr'm Theater
Weil erst das Kapital die Rebellion vermarktet
Siehst du die Analogie auch wir sind Teil dieses Spiels
Man steht im Rampenlicht und sieht nicht wie es Schatten wirft
Auch Plattenfirmen sind mulitnationale Monopole
Musik ist nur 'ne Ware, sie akkumulier'n Kohle
Auch wir sind Teil jener Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung
Kein Mensch ist mehr wert als sein Mehrwert ha'm wir nur noch vor Profit achtung
Effizienzwahn bestimmt Parlamentswahl'n
Die Kehrseite im nächsten Millennium leben 3 von 4 am Existenzminimum
Das sich im deutschen Geld auf Welt reimt ist das Zufall
Sind wir technisch Raumpatroullie ethisch Urknall
Es heißt es gäbe viele Stufen grau, werdet nicht farbenblind
Vergeßt nicht was die Scherben singen
„wenn die Nacht am tiefsten ist ist der Tag am nächsten”
Und die Revolution frißt ihre Kinder, nicht nur die Erwachsenen
Sollten wachsam sein wir wachsen mit und nicht abseits der Zeit
Sonst wird das Dogma der Bequemlichkeit das Tradition heißt Abstellgleis
Die Welt bleibt ein Reisender solang sie um die Sonne kreist
Wir haben einen Tod zu sterben, ein Leben zu geben
Um eh' wir das Zeitliche segnen nach Unsterblichkeit zu streben

Catalyst the revolution, move the troops from out pollution
Mobutu citizens get the boot right in they asses
Ambassador status bring the loot back to the masses
Who live like hostages, the system be abusive like the music business is
We exist in the abyss but images be marvellous like novelists
Picture this like hieroglyphics on the finest papyrus
The world is ours but it's devoured by the hour
Spread the scripture like Egyptians while the wicked spread the virus
Through the lies I realize the righteous bare my likeness
But they spite us so let the weak recite this
Sow my seed amongst the captives let the fleet complete the cipher

Pitschpatschnass
Floh ich unter das Vordach
Des Fachgeschäfts, vom Himmel goss ein Bach, ich schätz'
Es war halb acht, doch ich war hellwach
Als mich Anna ansah, anlachte
Ich dachte, sprich sie an, denn sie sprach mich an
Die Kleidung, ganz durchnässt, klebte an ihr fest
Die Tasche in der Hand, stand sie an der Wand
Die dunklen Augen funkelten wie 'ne Nacht in Asien
Strähnen im Gesicht nehmen ihr die Sicht
Mein Herz, das klopft, die Nase tropft, ich schäme mich
Benehme mich dämlich, bin nämlich eher schüchtern
„Mein Name ist Anna“, sagte sie sehr nüchtern
Ich fing an zu flüstern „Ich bin Max aus dem Schoss der Kolchose“
Doch so 'ne Katastrophe, das ging mächtig in die Hose
Mach mich lächerlich, doch sie lächelte „Ehrlich wahr, Mann“
Sieh' da, Anna war ein Hip-Hop-Fan

Immer wenn es regnet, muss ich an dich denken

Plitsch Platsch fiel ein Regen wie die Sintflut
Das Vordach, die Insel, wir waren wie Strandgut
Ich fand Mut, bin selbst überrascht über das Selbstverständnis
Meines Geständnisses, Anna ich fänd' es schön, mit dir auszugehen
Könnt mich dran gewöhn' dich öfters zu sehen
Anna zog mich an sich „An sich mag ich das nicht“
Spüre ihre süßen Küsse, wie sie mein Gesicht liebkost
Was geschieht bloß, lass mich nicht los
Anna, ich lieb bloß noch dich, andere sind lieblos, du bist
Wie Vinyl für meinen DJ, die Dialektik für Hegel
Pinsel für Picasso, für Philippe Schlagzeugschlegel
Anna, wie war das bei Dada
Du bist hinten wie vorne A-N-N-A
Du bist hinten wie vorne A-N-N-A

Sie gab mir 'nen Abschiedskuss, dann kam der Bus
Sie sagte „Max, ich muss“, die Türe schloss. „Was, ist jetzt Schluss“
Es goss, ich ging zu Fuß, bin konfus, fast gerannt
Anna nahm meinen Verstand, ich fand an Anna allerhand
Manchmal lach ich drüber, doch dann merk ich wieder, wie's mich trifft
Komik ist Tragik in Spiegelschrift
A-N-N-A von hinten wie vorne, dein Name sei gesegnet
Ich denk' an dich immer wenn es regnet

Yesterday I painted our bathroom in all sorts of colors
And the day before I slept in, before I went shopping
And I cooked our meal, seemed to forget the dishes
And I saw a little TV and went to bed...

Now it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?


And today I went to an interview for a boring job
And the lady there was boring too - I started to fade away
Yet I smiled and begged, which took time and energy
Though she pissed me off - I could really, really use the money ...


Now it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yes another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?

It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah - It's already Wednesday
I'll make a list of things to do â?? (and) get as much as I can
Cross off what's done - carry the rest to the next day
John and Poul had ""eight days a week"" - maybe I could borrow one

Now cause it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?

Isn't it strange who you end up with
Wanting other than you thought you did
Isn't it funny you're as different from me
As oranges from apples
As the Finnish from the French
As back to front and inside out
As starting from the end
As milk from wine
As snow from sunshine
As the sky from the sea
As Kate Moss from me?


You're apples
And I'm oranges
It's all the same to me
Without the dark night
There would be no daylight
So I'm gonna follow you like ""d"" follows ""see""

Isn't it strange who you end up with
Wanting one thing - getting the opposite
Isn't it funny you're as different from me
As soup from ice cream
As those who sleep, from who dreams
As candlelight from spotlight
As coffee from tea
As the relatively straight
From those who'd take both
As those who go down
From those who think it's gross?


You're apples
And I'm oranges
It's all the same to me
Without the dark night
There would be no daylight
So I'm gonna follow you like ""d"" follows ""see""

I know you wanna use your tongue when you and me kiss
You want an explanation why I'm making the first move
Your hesitation is why girls like me eat boys like you



When girls like me, eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to


When I first married you, it was for better, or for worse
50 years later I'm tired of ironing your shirts
The paint is off the picket fence, the hair is off your head
And that is why a boy like you is gathering cobwebs in bed


When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is it passes the time
And you just taste so nice and we like to!

Hey, what about the promises you made to me that we'll always be together and you'll be there, everyday I wake up. I found a box of notes you wrote , each one signed with X and Os and P.S. like I love you, we're never gonna break up.

Frickin' A,"I met her at the pool 
Yeah she was smokin' hot 
She told me maybe we should get together sometime 
She asked me if I could 
Rub oil on her back 
And that was fine with me 
And then I had a crazy fantasy, we were 

Naked in my bed 
One fling no strings 
Movin' all around the room 
Chicka chicka boom boom, and then we did it 

On the floor 
Against the door 
Up on the sink where we did it some more 
The sun was hot and we were both burning red 

We were naked in my bed 
She read her magazine 
Right in front of me 
The latest issue of Cosmo she said I should 

Check these positions out on page 69 
She pointed to this one, and said 
Looks like a lot of fun. Then we were

Unless I change my mind
Unless I decide

That all this comes right down to me

Frida,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns
Don't bother; they're here",Var Ar Min Clown (Send in the Clowns),1975
Frida,"I See Red
Back in my schooldays acting the fool days
One and one and one makes three
And a man said: ""Kid, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time.""

Armour-clad horses, riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine

[Chorus]
""Stop, pay the price,"" they said to me
Take this advice.  You're out of your head
Said: ""Stop, hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone.  Too bad I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red

When the sly man stumbles, twists, and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way, can't you go that way?
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving
Stop, pay the price

So who wants a riot?  People should be quiet
Don't we give them good T.V.?
You can learn to love your lifetime of distraction
Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
All the way from A to Z
I can live without that kind of satisfaction
Stop, pay the price",I See Red,1982
Frida,"Is she somewhere in the city, is she somewhere in this town?
What's her name, what does she look like, is she fun to be around?
Does she make you feel like I did, oh, so long ago?

I wanna hear it from you, tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you, tell me that it's over
I wanna hear it from you

First you look at me with anger in your eyes then you look at me with spite
That's if you look at me at all, that's how I'm looking at you tonight
You tell me that love's a drag for you but when the lights go out you panic

I wanna hear it from you, tell me that it's over
Let me hear it from you, tell me that it's over

Bled your heart
And did you cruel
So I'll leave you with your eyes closed

Frida,"Lilacs blossom just as sweet
Now my heart is shattered
If I bowled it down the street
Who's to say it mattered?

If there's one that rode away
What would I be missing?
Lips that taste of tears, they say
Are the best for kissing

Eyes that watch the morning star
Seem a little brighter
Arms held out to darkness
Are usually whiter

Shall I bar the strolling guest?
Bind my brow with willow
When, they say, the empty breast
Is the softer pillow?

That a heart falls tinkling down
Never think it ceases
Every likely lad in town
Gathers up the pieces

If there's one gone whistling by
Would I let it grieve me?
Let him wonder if I lie
Let him half believe me
",Threnody,1982
Frida,"No rain but I felt the thunder

From someone like you
Who knows what will happen

Hope for some reaction

I just need to say you fell

But me and a whisper
And now it's failing

We share a life in one dimension
Our problems always seem to cloud the sky
But we don't pay them much attention

And with every day
We drift apart

That man is not the man I used to know

And though a part of me still needs him so
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly

No angry words and no heart-rending scenes
And we should take it as a warning
We keep on going through the old routines
Exchanging kisses in the morning

And with every day we drift apart
And the fear is in my heart
I read the signs and I should be mature
And yet a child could not be more unsure

There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly
Our passion's just a distant memory

And in its place a dull frustration
A cold indifference where there used to be
At least a frequent irritation
But a feeling still

Of tenderness
And of pity, so I guess
I'll be the woman in his arms tonight
If he should need someone to hold him tight

He's like a child

Now you and I descended
On a world with innocent hopes
We traveled that criss-crossed highway
And cascaded down the slopes.

It's time to look at who we are
And let the feelings show
It's time to leave the past now
And grow.

I've listened to endless voices
I've proceeded with endless tact
I've figured in endless numbers
And I've worked on the traits I lacked.

I've come too far, the time is right
The devil's made his pact
It's time to stop pretending
And act.

I turn the world around
Change the things that need changing
Don't try to predict tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow's out of sight.

Ett laddat vardagsrum
Två tysta spända munnar
Infekterat
Resignerat samtal
Vid två stängda dörrar
Ingen av oss vet nog varför
Vi fryser ut varann
Två brustna hjärtan gråter
Förhållandet
Så bra maskerat
Känns nu hopplöst
Och passerat
Vem kommer såra vem ikväll
Vems tur att fälla tårar
Vem kommer såra vem ikväll

Älskade med verklig glöd
Var relationen äkta

Frida,"You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene

Frida,"I can see that it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words they lie
That's something you can't deny
I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
I know a good thing must come to an end
But it's hard to take loosing a friend
I know what you think and what's in your mind
So darling don't pretend
I know there's something going on.",I Know There’s Something Going On,2018
Frida Amundsen,"It's getting late
I'm wide awake
And my mind is raising again
I can't find the words
They all seem wrong
Like the meaning is lost in translation

[Chorus]
I have always been in love with you,
But,
You are unable to see that
I have felt this way, every night and day
Wishing that you would just come
A little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Closer to me
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come closer, closer to me

You must be blind
Believe me I have tried
But nothing I do gets you to see me
How do you feel
I need to know
'Cause my heart just wants to scream it

[Chorus: x2]",Closer,2012
Frida Amundsen,"Can’t you see how much I’ve changed
Hardly any part of me remains
So you and I could be the same
I tried to be the way you are

But all that I’ve achieved so far
Is driving us apart
But I won’t be your mirror
I can’t keep doing what I do
I could turn myself into you
Who you want me to be
Is an echo of me

If I keep losing what I’ve got
I’m becoming into someone I’m not
All you love, don’t you see
Is an echo of me

I can’t be you; I won’t pretend
I don’t know why you don’t comprehend
You wouldn’t want me in the end
I never gave a guarantee

I’d adjust ‘til I could barely breathe
I can’t be all the things you need
‘Cause I’m not your mirror

I can’t keep doing what I do
Bleaching out myself til I’m you
Who you want me to be
Is an echo of me
If I keep losing what I’ve got
Turning into someone I’m not
All you love, don’t you see
Is an echo of me

You stole my heart
And so much of me
Now I am only half
Of what it takes to feel complete",Echo Of Me,2012
Frida Boccara,"Il y aura cent mille chansons
Quand viendra le temps des cent mille saisons
Cent mille amoureux
Pareils à nous deux
Dans le lit tout bleu de la terre
Cent mille chansons rien qu'à nous
Cent mille horizons devant nous
Partagés de bonheur
Tout étalé de nos coeurs
Et des châteaux insensés
Et des bateaux étoilés
Et des étoiles oubliées
Et tes yeux et mes yeux
Dans un océan d'amour

Il y aura cent mille chansons
Quand viendra le temps des cent mille saisons
Cent mille maisons
Gravées à ton nom
Parmi les moissons de la terre
Cent mille chansons rien qu'à nous
Cent mille horizons devant nous
Partagés de bonheur
Tout étalé de nos coeurs
Et des pays reconnus
Et des forêts éperdues
Et des chagrins défendus
Et tes yeux et mes yeux

Frida Boccara,"Quand Cherbourg nous a vus
Arriver sur le port
Ta main serrant la mienne
A nos regards perdus 
Il a dû dire encor
En voilà deux qui s'aiment
En voilà deux qui s'aiment
En voilà deux de plus
En voilà deux de plus 
Qui brûleront leur coeur
Aux feux de la Saint-Jean
Quand aura disparu cet insolent bonheur
Qui fait rire les gens qui fait rire les gens
Qu'ils croisent dans la rue mais Cherbourg a ouvert
Pour nous fêter quand même
Sa grande ombrelle bleue
Et le vent de la mer giflant les écoutilles
A cueilli pour nous deux des parfums de vanille
Quand Cherbourg nous a vus
Arriver sur le port
Ta main serrant la mienne
A nos regards perdus
Il a dû dire encor
En voilà deux qui s'aiment
En voilà deux qui s'aiment
En voilà deux de plus
Contournant les maisons
Le soleil a brillé sur toutes les façades
Un air d'accordéon venu du monde entier
Nous a donné l'aubade nous a donné l'aubade
Comme à des mariés comme à des mariés
Emportant leur amour au creux des voiles blanches
Pour aller voyager au pays sans retour
Des cent mille dimanches des cent milles dimanches
Qui font l'éternité
Mais notre goélette malgré ses airs de fête
N'a pas quitté le port
Notre amour est resté tout seul au bout du quai
De peur de s'embarquer et moi j'en pleure encore
Cherbourg avait raison Cherbourg avait raison
De nous fêter quand même
Avec ses cargaisons
De coups d'accordéon et de coups de sirènes
Il n'a pas tant d'amours qui en vaillent la peine
Cherbourg avait raison Cherbourg avait raison.",Cherbourg Avait Raison,1996
Frida Boccara,"Dans les rues de Rio un enfant s'émerveille
en voyant défiler sous ses yeux
le cortège or et bleu
des fanfares en livrée de soleil.
Oubliant ses habits, ses pieds nus,
dans ses rêves éperdus
il se prend pour un roi conduisant le sabbat.

{Refrain:}
Au milieu des cymbales, des feux de Bengale,
les cieux pleins d'étoiles, les yeux pleins de fleurs,
dans le coeur de la fête il jette son coeur.

Dans les rues de Rio un enfant tend ses mains en chantant
et devient le copain de tous les musiciens.

{Refrain}

Dans les rues de Rio un enfant vit son rêve.
En marchant il se prend pour un roi conduisant le sabbat.

Et bientôt un enfant, dix enfants, mille enfants l'accompagnent
en jouant des cymbales, en entrant dans le bal,
en dansant sous des arches de fleurs .
Et l'enfant qui sourit à pleins feux se nourrit de chansons
comme font tous les anges oubliés du Bon Dieu.

{Refrain}

Dans les rues de Rio un enfant disparaît dans la nuit
et bientôt sur un banc il s'endort en rêvant
d'un million de cymbales, de feux de Bengale,
de fleurs et d'étoiles, d'étoiles et de fleurs,
c'est le coeur de la fête qui dort dans son coeur.
Dans les rues de Rio un enfant s'émerveille en rêvant
comme une fleur de faubourg au soleil de l'amour.",L' Enfant aux Cymbales,1999
Frida Boccara,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur,1999

Frida Boccara,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

Ich hör' dich atmen spür' den Puls deiner Zeit

Und wenn du willst
Kannst du alles für mich sein
Woran ich nicht mehr geglaubt hab
In dieser Welt voller Schein

Lieb deine Liebe schnell
Bevor's ein anderer tut
Lieb sie so sehr du kannst
Sie meint es mit dir gut
Riskiere alles was du hast
Besser gleich als irgendwann

Denn du wirst getrieben
Von falschen Strömen der Zeit
Die mit dir nichts zu tun haben
Sei auf der Hut und bereit
Dich neu zu erfinden
Egal wie viel du verlierst
Denk nicht, sprich nicht und küss mich
Und lass es passieren

Und wenn du willst
Kannst du alles für mich sein
Woran ich nicht mehr geglaubt hab
In dieser Welt voller Schein

Lieb deine Liebe schnell

Lieb sie so sehr du kannst

Frida Gold,"Ich bin mittendrin und geb mich allem hin
Aber schaut man hinter die Kulissen,
Dann fängt es immer so an, ich schlafe immer zu lang,
Krieg's nicht hin und fühl mich deshalb beschissen.
Ich erkenn' mich nicht in den Schaufensterscheiben,
Entdecke nichts, was mir gefällt.
Ich brauch' die schönsten Kleider und die stärksten Männer
Und eine Hand, die meine Hand für immer festhält.

Wovon sollen wir träumen
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
Woran können wir glauben?
Wo führt das hin?
Was kommt und bleibt
So wie wir sind?

Ich fühl' mich leer und die Nacht liegt schwer,
So schwer auf meinen Schultern.
All die Hoffnung, die war ist schon lang nicht mehr da.
Schon wieder 'ne Nacht einfach vertan.
Ich hab gesucht und gesucht, in den hintersten Ecken
Nach Augen, die mich interessieren.
Noch nie hat das geklappt, doch ich mag's nicht kapieren.

Wovon sollen wir träumen
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
Woran können wir glauben?
Wo führt das hin?
Was kommt und bleibt
So wie wir sind?

Wir lassen uns treiben durch die Clubs der Stadt,
Durch fremde Hände und wir werden nicht satt.
Wir wachen dann auf bei jemand anderem Geliebten,
Von denen wir dachten, dass wir sie nie verlassen.

Wir könn' nicht mehr atmen und vergessen zu essen.
Wir trinken zu viel, es bleibt 'n Spiel ohne Ziel.
Wann hört das auf? Wann komm' wir hier raus?
Wovon sollen wir träumen?
Wo sind wir zuhaus'?
Wo sind wir zuhaus'?

Wovon sollen wir träumen
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
Woran können wir glauben?
Wo führt das hin?

Frida Gold,"Zeig mir wie du tanzt und ich sag dir wer du bist
Und so wie du guckst weiß ich wonach dir ist
Zeig mir wie du sprichst und ich sag dir was du hörst
Ich will wissen wie du riechst und ob du mich betörst

Und so wie du tanzt kann ich fühlen wer du bist
Und fast wie in Trance lassen wir uns drauf ein
Und so wie ich tanz seh ich's funkeln in deinem Blick
Wir verschmelzen ganz sanft fast von allein

Zeig mir wie du küsst und ich sag dir ob's mir schmeckt
Zeig wie du dich bewegst und ob du meine Sinne weckst
Zeig mir wie du tanzt, tanzt, tanzt, tanzt - tanzt,tanzt,tanzt,tanzt
Zeig mir wie du tanzt, tanzt, tanzt, tanzt - und ich fühl dich, und ich fühl dich

Und so wie du tanzt kann ich fühlen wer du bist
Und fast wie in Trance lassen wir uns drauf ein
Und so wie ich tanz seh ich's funkeln in deinem Blick
Wir verschmelzen ganz sanft fast von allein

So wie du dich bewegst macht alles einen Sinn
So wie du jetzt loslässt kommt plötzlich alles hin
So wie du dich anfühlst so fühlt sich Leben an
Und dich nicht mehr aufführst so kommst du endlich an
Und dich nicht mehr aufführst so kommst du endlich an

Ich bin auf der Suche
Nach Liebe die so ist, so wie wir waren
Pur und ohne Versuche
Und ohne Angst uns zu verlieren
Wir waren nur down, sonst nirgendwo
Wir liefen einfach so
Unbefangen, unvollkommen, im selben Flow
Uns interessierte nicht
Das die Zeit rennt
Da war nur der Moment

Doch die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und wir verfehlen so oft das Ziel
Denn wenn ich heute an Liebe denke
Dann ist es so so kompliziert
Denn die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und jeder will grad viel zu viel
Und dann geht wieder was zu Ende
Ich wünsch' mir so du wärst noch hier (Du und)

Längst
Schon verbrauchte Lippen
War Küssen nicht die Sprache des Paradies?
Längst schon enttäuschte Erwartung
Worauf warten, wenn das Gute vor uns liegt
Du warum geht das nicht
Was ist da so schwer
So zu leben und zu lieben, als gäb's kein Morgen mehr
Ich vermiss das so
Wir waren im selben Flow
Euch vermisst ich so

Doch die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und wir verfehlen so oft das Ziel
Denn wenn ich heute an Liebe denke
Dann ist es so so kompliziert
Denn die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und jeder will grad viel zu viel
Und dann geht wieder was zu Ende
Ich wünsch' mir so du wärst noch hier.

Wir sind besser zu zweit
Hab den Mut zu riskieren

Du warum geht das nicht
Was ist da so schwer
So zu leben und zu lieben, als gäb's kein Morgen mehr.

Wenn der Wind pfeift, gehen alle, sie bleibt
Sie ist zwei Welten in einer, trägt Air-Max zum Prada-Kleid

Doch wenn sie redet, hat das Wort aus ihrem Mund Gewicht
Sie braucht kein Glimmern, kein Glamour

Baby, ich steh’ zu dir

Ich bin kein Prototyp-Bilderbuch-Märchenprinz
Doch habe was übrig für diese Frau, wenn ich ehrlich bin
Sie kommt zu mir, braucht keine Kumpels zum Chillen
Nicht weil sie soll oder muss, sondern will
Vertrau mir, sie mag es, sich zuhause aufzutakeln
Und glaub mir, wenn ich sage, draußen juckt sie gar nix
Sie will meinen Stress lindern

Friday Night Posse,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.

Now we're getting real
This is where we leave them far behind
So let's make a deal
To keep an open mind

With you it seems so wild to fight
It seems so wild to deny
Love like this is hard to find
Love like this is ours

Close to the line
Since you've been on my mind
Now the storm subsides
Love like waves

Holding so long
Till the feeling comes on
Breaking love like waves
Love like waves
Love like waves

Stare into the deep
I can see reflections of my life
Where I could've been
And other storylines

The blue between the earth and sky
White horses surf on the tide
Love like this is hard to find
Love like this is ours

Close to the line
Since you've been on my mind
Now the storm subsides
Love like waves

Carried away
Spending all of my day
Searching far and wide
Love like waves

It's been up and down
But my heart's coming round
As the sunlight fades
Love like waves

Holding so long
Till the feeling comes on
Breaking love like waves
Love like waves

We can dive deeper
If we share breath underwater
We can dive deeper
If we share breath underwater

With you it seems so wild to fight
It seems so wild to deny
Love like this is hard to find
Love like this is ours

Lying alone in the hospital
I can't do anything right
When I'm with someone like you

Oh, deep in my heart, yes, I know
Our love's run out
Oh, deep in my heart, yes, I know
I caused this row

Nothing is left, only a memory
A glitch in my heart
Until you come back to me

Nothing is left, only a memory
A glitch in my heart

Your love will soon wear out
Oh, deep in my heart, yes, I know
I think you'll work something out

Friendly Fires,"Inner city sky rise over town at night
You pushed me to the top floor
So we could see the sights

I could tell that you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool

I push out, I breathe in
A stillness turning away
Don't look back, don't pretend
We'll never take control again

We're falling beyond the horizon
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away

On the poolside staring into glowing blue
Swimsuit issues with my toes
Curled in the grooves

I could tell that you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool, jump in the pool

I push out, I breathe in
A stillness turning away
Don't look back, don't pretend
We'll never take control again

And before that we own the horizon
And only the water remains
The fear is falling away

Keep breathing, keep searching, keep holding on
Keep breathing, keep living, keep holding on

I push out, I breathe in
A stillness turning away

We'll never take control again

These things they don't work out?
Best to walk away
Before your love runs out

Don't you feel sometimes
You don't know who you are
Giving all you got
But you all just [Incomprehensible]

I'm lovesick, I'm lovesick
I'm lovesick, I'm lovesick

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms, in your arms

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms, in your arms

Don't you feel sometimes
You might need this just too much
What everybody else
Thinks you're out of touch?

And don't you think it's about time
You turn the page and move on?
And learn to shake it up
Before your love runs out

I'm lovesick, I'm lovesick
I'm lovesick, I'm lovesick

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms, in your arms

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms, in your arms

Lovesick, lovesick

Hold the world in your hands

Giving it the natch, posing like we're this year's models

You wanna shake it right down
You wanna leave me somehow

I forget about you
I lose myself in flashing colors
I've gotta see it through

You're too much,
I take it that we're over
Should we even care at all?
You're too much, too much
Let's shake hands and say good

Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through

Your love is out
Believing despite the loss
Give me your hand
Let's face this night and see it through

Right by my feet, lay broken glasses
You Skeleton Boy
Sweat from the walls, drips on my shoulder
I've got to see it through
