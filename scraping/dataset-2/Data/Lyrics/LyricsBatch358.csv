Herb Alpert,"While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to Daddy.

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
But my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy he treats it so well

There was a dame that a football game
Made long for the strong undergraddie
I never dream of making the team
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
'Cause my Daddy, he treats it so well",My Heart Belongs to Daddy,1967
Herb Alpert,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1967
Herb Alpert,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
",In a Little Spanish Town,1967
Herb Alpert,"When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people get a soul
Ony those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how ""bad"" we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us
Try to help us
Before this plain granted planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without a pity can do
No it isn't very pretty 
What a town without pity can do

Herb Alpert,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1968
Herb Alpert,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,1968
Herb Alpert,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride,1968
Herb Alpert,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1968
Herb Alpert,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Herb Alpert,"Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Never on Sunday,1970
Herb Alpert,"There was a little Spanish flea
A record star he thought he'd be
He heard of singers like Beatles
And The Chipmunks he'd seen on TV
Why not a little Spanish flea?

And so he hid
Inside a doggie from Madrid
He arrived in the city
Still singin his sweet harmony
As proud as any flea could be

He walked around
As if he owned the town
Humming his pint sized melody
With his guitar he knew he'd be a star
And in his own home town, how proud he'd be

Then all at once he met a man
Who said, ""I'll help you if I can""
He listened close to his song
And then he sang right along for you see
He loved that little Spanish flea",Spanish Flea,1970
Herb Alpert,"Down in old Tijuana town
There's this happy honkin' sound,
Something you just can't put down
It's the world renown Tijuana Taxi cab.
So, you're not impressed you say
With a beat up Chevrolet
But that driver man Jose 
Knows his way around Tijuana town. 

Hey, ya wanna swing (You just tell Jose)
Have yourself a fling (What-cha wanna play)
Meet some pretty thing? (Any time you say)
Livin' like a king! (Long as you can pay)

French perfume, man, from Venezuela 
When you're on a Tijuana Taxi ride!

Love that mariachi band,
But the best thing in the land
Is that hand-me-down Tijuana Taxicab

Herb Alpert,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1973
Herb Alpert,"I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 

It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door 
To an empty room 
You go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun 
When you have to spend another day 
Without her 

We burst the pretty balloon took us to the moon 
It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie 
I said I'd rather die than live without her 

Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing 
And it moves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part 
And it's breaking my heart 
To have to spend a day without her, 
Can't go on without her",Without Her,1973

I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
Yes I'm in love and what I'd do to make you mine

Herb Alpert,"We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance

Sei piena di un amore che a passato
Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Odio l'estate
Il sole che ogni giorno ci saldava
Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva
Addeso brucia solo con furor

Tornerà un altro inverno
Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve coprirà tutte le cose
E forse un po' di pace tornerà

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again

That's where I fell in love, when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed a smile upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered, ?manana?
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered, ?manana?
'Cause our tomorrow never came

There in a veil of white, by the candlelight, she knelt to pray

A record star he thought he'd be
He heard of singers like Beatles
And The Chipmunks he'd seen on TV
Why not a little Spanish flea?

And so he hid
Inside a doggie from Madrid
He arrived in the city
Still singin his sweet harmony
As proud as any flea could be

He walked around
As if he owned the town
Humming his pint sized melody
With his guitar he knew he'd be a star
And in his own home town, how proud he'd be

Then all at once he met a man
Who said, ""I'll help you if I can""
He listened close to his song
And then he sang right along for you see
He loved that little Spanish flea",Spanish Flea,1965

That you and I have finally said goodbye

And my love was ready for the takin',

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Herb Ellis,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1982
Herb Ellis,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Herb Ellis,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,1982
Herb Ellis,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1987
Herb Ellis,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1987
Herb Ellis,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1987
Herb Ellis,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie""
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top",Straighten up and Fly Right,1987
Herb Ellis,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1987
Herb Ellis,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1988
Herb Ellis,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity

Herb Ellis,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Herb Ellis,"As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
The light behind your face helps me realize

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Wandering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Love's indescribable
It should be me, it could be me

Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
You've got the body now you want my soul

Herb Ellis,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Oh! Will you never set me free?

And when you smiled at me,

I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Herb Ellis,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
But we just fizz like parts of seidlitz powder

Yes, a fine romance, with no glitches
A fine romance, with no beaches
Just as hard to land as the Isle de France
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance

Yes, a fine romance, my dear judges
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
Oh we don't have the thrills
That the march of time has

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong aged in the wood, woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No you like cactus plants
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my dear duchess
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
You know Louie we don't have half the thrills
That the march of time has

You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No I prefer cactus plants

And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

[Chorus]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane

Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you

Herb Ellis,"The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with it's cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

Each wonderful night in Tunisia",A Night in Tunisia,2000

It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother

Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me

So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

No one to hurry us through

Our P's and Q's.

With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew

A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute 

I'll jump out a tenant rented, and leave a nigga body dented

Herb Pedersen,"You've gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by

Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by

I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by

They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close by",Close By,1988

Down along the road I love it still
There I know my dear old mother's waiting
Waiting and I know she always will

Home is where the heart is they tell me
Many, many try to travel that lonesome road
They'll never find a pal as true as mother
They'll never find a place as sweet as home

Started out out to ramble all around
If ever I return to where I came from
I'll build a little home and settle down

Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us
I have no home No mother nor dad

   On these tomestones it did say
   On mother's ""gone but not forgotten""
    On dad's ""we'll meet again someday""

I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He'll do the rest

Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they'll dwell with god above
Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious love",Memories of Mother and Dad,1988

If I ever get my hands on a dollar again

That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Herb Pomeroy,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Herb Pomeroy and His Stablemates,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might As Well Be Spring,2008

Herb Remington,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

One little thought to me

Nearer your heart?

Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

Herb Remington,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Herbalizer,"To become aware of my own sensuality,
I first become fully aware of my own tactile sense.
In dim light, I close my eyes and remove my clothes.

Do I lose his respect for being so wild?
Hardly. He treats me like a rare and precious jewel.
And he goes through the day proud of the fact, that with me,
He is the world's most imaginative lover.

Men pick amazing places for sexual adventure.
The wildest adventure proposed to me was in a bathtub which was full of Jello!
All I could think of, was how many boxes it would take?
What would be the most alluring colour?
The most delicious flavour?
And how could that affect our oral explarations?
If the Jello gets firm, would I bounce?

As you look around for what's new and different,
Remember these three important weapons that should be learned to keep a man in love.
Imagination, sensitivity to his moods and desires,
And the courage to experiment with new sexual techniques,
Enticing situations and places.

Lovemaking is physical, and so its its language.
Suck, cock, fuck, and prick, are not bad words.
Used in the bedroom by lovers to describe parts of the body,
And physical activities,
They are very proper indeed, and they distinctly enhance sex.
Overhaul a prudish attitude.
Don't whistle and stick up your nose, at least, not up in the air.",The Sensual Woman,1999

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Retreating inside yourself in cold funk at it all
Afraid of any freedom, of looking a fool
You skate on the surface, afraid of the depth of the pool

Fear that you'll become nothing
And that time's running out
So afraid of getting used to things
Only fear remains beyond doubt
Fear that you'll become nothing
And the thought makes you numb
Angst makes you tiny
Angst strikes you dumb

Fear needs an armoury, afraid of your foes
Oh, but angst won't remind you, most enemies are ghosts
So scared to be beaten, too scared to compete
Scared of stupidity, so smart on the streets

Fear gets employed as a system, intimidation as control
Fear shuts you up, eats the soul

Fear of each other, too scared to connect
We won't meet each other's eyes, all eyes we suspect
Afraid of emotion, scared of tenderness
Afraid that experience only leads to distress

Fear that you'll become nothing
And that time's running out
So afraid of getting used to things
Only fear remains beyond doubt
Fear that you'll become nothing
And the thought makes you numb
Angst makes you tiny
Angst strikes you dumb

Fear of manipulation, of being left in the cold
Scared you don't do right by everyone, fear eats the soul

So scared of being scared, we go to sleep",Angst,

Prowl around the neighborhood, the hunter captured by the game

She's stubborn but so am I
I want her more as each and every day goes by
Be my ally, conquer her pride
We two together could besiege her heart from every side
Be my friend, don't let her slip through my hands

Cast your spell upon her, I'll stalk through her dreams
So I can find her there defenseless, surrendering her love to me
And if you do this for me, oh what delight
I'll turn into a werewolf then and howl to you throughout the night

Full moon, shine down your light on me
Full moon, make me her lunacy
You know she doesn't want me but you can turn the tide
I can't go on without her so quickly, make her mine
Full moon, hear my lonely cry

You're so pale, I'm deathly white
If nothing happens soon I don't think I can last the night
From up in heaven you stare down on us serene
I'm in desperation, and I'm begging you to rescue me
Do something now, tomorrow will be too late

My last hope's in your power,listen to my plea
And help me now to win her heart or it'll be the end of me
I'm drowning in the tears that all true lovers shed
Don't leave me in this limbo, moon
Don't leave me in this loneliness

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Anna, es fällt mir furchtbar schwer
Alle Beschreibungen wirken leer
Du bist nichts, was man so sagt

Du hast kein freundliches Naturell
Deine Launen wechseln schnell
Du küsst mich nur, wenn ich dich frag'

Du kannst mit deinen Maschen
Einen ganz schön überraschen

Bist dir sicher du wirst nicht alt
Gesund zu leben lässt dich kalt
Rauchst soviel, wie's eben geht

Bei dir muss immer was passieren
Ich muss mich ewig engagieren
Du bist ständig leicht überdreht

Wenn ich dann erschöpft im Bette liege
Bist du noch lang nicht müde

Ich hab' dich viel lieber als es klingen mag
Grad weil du so bist, lieb ich dich sehr
Ich weiß auch nicht, wie's mit dir ist
Es ist einfach unbeschreiblich
Ich brauch' dich

Anna, du bist schon nicht mehr schlank
Schon eher Magerkrank
Hältst konstant dein Untergewicht

Findest meine Witze oft flau
Kennst meine Schwächen zu genau
Manchmal nervt dich mein Gesicht

Wenn ich mich nicht ständig um dich kümmer'
Mach ich alles nur noch schlimmer

Ich hab dich viel lieber als es klingen mag

Das hab ich mich sonst nie getraut
Ich sage, oh Liebling
Sind sie gut gebaut
Darf ich mal ihre Hand ein wenig halten
Darf ich mal ihren Abend gestalten

Ich bin vielleicht nicht sehr geschickt
Aber ich hätt' sie gern ein wenig beglückt
Darf ich mal, oh welche Qual

Sie sind die Frau meiner Träume
Und meiner Phantasie
Darf ich mal kurz erwähnen
Ich liebe sie
Darf ich mal einen Arm um sie legen
Darf ich mal, oder ist das verwegen

Oh Liebling, seien sie mir nicht bös
Ich bin eben noch ein wenig nervös
Darf ich mal, ich find' sie kolossal

Oh Liebling, seien sie nicht so stur
Ein ganz kleines Lächeln nur
Darf ich mal, geben sie mir ein Signal

Ich bin heut' nicht in Form
Hör auf, mich zu drängen
Hör auf, mich zu nötigen

Ich liege in meinem Bett, hundemüde
Sie beugt sich über mich
Ihr Gesicht ist groß und rund wie der Mond
Sie guckt so zärtlich und so fordernd
Streichelt meinen Kopf und sagt
Komm Schätzchen, komm Liebling, komm Schätzchen
Und dann schiebt sie sich ganz langsam über mich

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Er war sehr gern allein
Sein Leben war der Film
Saß immer im Kino
Fast egal, was da lief

Er liebte den Raum
Fühlte sich hier Zuhaus'
Und immer wenn's brutal wurde
Flippte er aus

Für ihn war Gewalt
Das Töten und Sterben ganz normal
Er fand es toll
Wenn sie lachten und schrien
Irgendwas muss daran doch sehr schön sein
Irgendwas muss daran doch sehr schön sein
Es hat ihn fasziniert
Es hat ihn verführt, es selbst zu tun

Ich will's ausprobieren
Einmal nur spüren

Ich möchte sehen, wie es ist

Nicht im Film
Einfach live
Mal sehen, wie das ist

Er war kein bisschen nervös
Hatte ein Messer gekauft
Saß wie immer im Kino
Ihm war egal, was da lief

Stach einfach zu
Direkt neben sich
Er sah in Zeitlupe
Jeden einzelnen Stich

Er hat es geschafft, schon vorbei
Er fühlte noch nicht viel
Genau wie im Film hatte er getötet
Was soll denn daran so schlimm sein
Was soll denn daran so schlimm sein
Sie haben ihn verhört
Das hat ihn verstört, leicht verwirrt

Dass jede mich nur zu dir führt

Du bist so gut für mich
Hey, wieso war ich so blind
Ich mach dich nie mehr unglücklich
Bitte, ich möchte zurück zu dir

Warum bin ich weg von dir
Ich war einfach widerlich

Doch auch die Faulenzerei
Ist nicht das Gelbe vom Ei

Damit das Kreuz nicht erlahmt

Jahrelang überwacht
Tausendmal aufgegeben
Alles falsch, ich will nur leben

Jetzt oder nie
Jetzt oder nie mehr
Jetzt oder nie
Wascht ihr nur eure Autos

Sie werden dich fotografieren
Sie werden dich registrieren
Du verbaust dir dein ganzes Leben
Warum nur du?
Es gibt doch soviele andere

Kämpfen für ein Land
Wo jeder noch reden kann
Herausschreien, was ihm weh tut
Wer ewig schluckt, stirbt von innen

Jetzt oder nie
Jetzt oder nie mehr
Jetzt oder nie
Wascht ihr nur eure Autos

Es tut so gut
Wenn dir die Seele brennt
Du auf die Straße rennst
Und du zeigst, es geht dir nicht gut
Dass dir der Kopf zerspringt
Und du weißt, dass du was tun musst

Wir werden dosiert zensiert
Menschen achtlos diffamiert
Wie eine träge Herde Kühe
Schauen wir kurz auf und grasen dann gemütlich weiter

Das Fernsehen redet uns tot
Pflanzen sterben an Atemnot
Wir warten immer zu lange
Die Zeit rennt weg
Wir müssen's angehen

Jetzt oder nie
Jetzt oder nie mehr
Jetzt oder nie
Wascht ihr nur eure Autos

Es tut so gut
Wenn dir die Seele brennt
Du auf die Straße rennst
Und du zeigst, es geht dir nicht gut
Dass dir der Kopf zerspringt
Und du weißt
Dass du was tun musst

Jetzt oder nie
Jetzt oder nie mehr

Wascht ihr nur eure Autos

Wascht ihr nur eure Autos

Jetzt oder nie
Wascht ihr nur eure Autos

Jetzt oder nie (jetzt oder nie)
Jetzt oder nie, nie, nie, nie, nie, nie, nie, nie mehr (jetzt oder nie)

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Ich hass' nichts mehr, als mich zu verspäten
Die Sonne brennt, und im Auto ist's heiß
Ein Hupkonzert wie von tausend Trompeten
Ich will zu dir, nun steh ich hier, so 'n Scheiß

Oh! Ich drehe schon seit Stunden
Hier so meine Runden
Es trommeln die Motoren
Es dröhnt in meinen Ohren
Ich finde keinen Parkplatz
Ich komm' zu spät zu dir, mein Schatz
Du sitzt bei Kaffee und Kuchen
Und ich muss weiter suchen

An jeder Ecke stehen Politessen
Lauern wie Panther, zum Sprung bereit
Hier kannste nicht parken, das kannste vergessen
Haben alles im Griff, weit und breit

Ich drehe schon seit Stunden
Hier so meine Runden
Es trommeln die Motoren
Es dröhnt in meinen Ohren
Ich finde keinen Parkplatz
Ich komm zu spät zu dir, mein Schatz
Du sitzt bei Kaffee und Kuchen
Und ich such hier rum

Auto fängt an zu kochen
Herz an zu pochen
Werde langsam panisch, klitschnass geschwitzt
Es ist nicht zu fassen solche Automassen
Haben die kein Zuhause, ich will zu dir

Oh! Ich drehe schon seit Stunden
Hier so meine Runden
Es trommeln die Motoren
Es dröhnt in meinen Ohren
Ich finde keinen Parkplatz
Ich komm zu spät zu dir, mein Schatz
Du sitzt bei Kaffee und Kuchen
Und ich sucher' hier rum

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Männer nehmen in den Arm
Männer geben Geborgenheit
Männer weinen heimlich
Männer brauchen viel Zärtlichkeit

Oh Männer sind so verletzlich
Männer sind auf dieser Welt einfach unersetzlich

Männer kaufen Frauen
Männer stehen ständig unter Strom
Männer baggern wie blöde
Männer lügen am Telefon

Männer sind allzeit bereit
Männer bestechen durch ihr Geld und ihre Lässigkeit

Männer haben's schwer, nehmen's leicht
Außen hart und innen ganz weich
Werden als Kind schon auf Mann geeicht
Wann ist ein Mann ein Mann?
Wann ist ein Mann ein Mann?

Männer bauen Raketen
Männer machen alles ganz genau
Oh wann ist ein Mann ein Mann?

Männer kriegen keine Kinder
Männer kriegen dünnes Haar
Männer sind auch Menschen
Männer sind etwas sonderbar

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Er kann die Sprüche nicht mehr hören
Du bist jung, was soll's, Kopf hoch
Du kommst auch noch dran
Er kann den Briefkasten nicht mehr leeren
Tausend mal, es tut uns leid
Wir stellen keinen mehr an
Geduld hat ihre Grenzen
Der gute Glaube ist längst aufgebraucht

Wo ein Wille ist
Ist kein Weg
Der Eigenwert hat den Nullpunkt fast erreicht
Sie schlagen Schaum, er schlägt sich durch
Den größten Teil der offenen Zukunft sinnlos vergeigt
Er weiß auch nicht, was ihn noch hochhält
Flucht in harte Hoffnung, noch nicht alles vorbei?

Einmal wissen was Leben heißt
Einmal dabei sein
Einmal was, das dich aus dem Dreck reißt
Einmal vom Druck befreit
Einmal mitten im Leben stehen
Für voll genommen
Einmal wirklich 'ne echte Chance sehen
Und sie bekommen, oh, das wär's
Ja, das wär's

Die rote Karte ständig im Blick
Außen vor, Sperre wofür?
Viel zu früh
Kraft der Jugend im traurigem Stück
Viel Gerede, nichts, verratene Energie
Er kennt das Leben nur von Bildern
Das Traumschiff lässt ihn nicht an Bord

Einmal wissen was Leben heißt

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Die Armeen aus Gummibärchen
Die Panzer aus Marzipan
Kriege werden aufgegessen
Einfacher Plan
Kindlich genial

Es gibt kein Gut, es gibt kein Böse
Es gibt kein Schwarz, es gibt kein Weiß
Es gibt Zahnlücken, statt zu unterdrücken
Gibt's Erdbeereis auf Lebenszeit
Immer für 'ne Überraschung gut

Gebt den Kindern das Kommando
Sie berechnen nicht was sie tun
Die Welt gehört in Kinderhände
Dem Trübsinn ein Ende
Wir werden in Grund und Boden gelacht
Kinder an die Macht

Sie sind die wahren Anarchisten
Lieben das Chaos, räumen ab
Kennen keine Rechte, keine Pflichten
Noch ungebeugte Kraft
Massenhaft
Ungestümer Stolz

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Witze kursieren
Industrielle gehen schmieren
Das Geld ist wieder mal allmächtig
Die Politiker funktionieren prächtig
Alles läuft auf Wunsch

Agenten geben sich ein Stelldichein
Das Kabel bringt den Sonnenschein
Das Klima so mild
Die Hintern werden immer breiter
Nur wer aussitzt, der kommt weiter
Alles halb so wild
Was soll's?

Ein Lächeln liegt auf diesem Land
Grinst unerträglich ignorant
Lächeln wird bei uns zur Pflicht
Witz komm raus
Langsam wird's lächerlich

Alles geschönt
Rücktritte verpönt
Selbstgerechte Gefälligkeit
Man tritt kleinste Erfolge breit
Um die Fehler zu kaschieren

Wer über das Lächeln lacht
Sich als Staatsfeind verdächtig macht
Schwarze Listen rotieren
Geschürt wird eitle Zuversicht
Die im Abseits stehen zählen nicht
Alle sind doch gut dabei

Herbert Grönemeyer,"Es liegt ein Zittern in der Luft, deutlich zu spüren
Es ist ein Klagen an die Welt, keiner will es hören
Eisenhartes Gottvertrauen, abgetrennt
Um sie herum ein großer Zaun
Das nennt man dann Homeland

Weiße Überheblichkeit, Maß aller Dinge
Weiße Überheblichkeit, jeder Mensch ist gleich
Der Weiße ist gleicher

In diesen Lagern weint die Wut, weiße Übermacht
Wir sitzen weich und sehen zu, was können wir schon tun
Wir sehen Schlagstöcke, schwarzes Blut
Stummer Schrei, auf ihren Rücken lebt sich's gut
Wir sind auch dabei

Weiße Überheblichkeit, Maß aller Dinge
Weiße Überheblichkeit, jeder Mensch ist gleich
Der Weiße ist gleicher

Zu feige zu reagieren, zu feige zu boykottieren
Zu feige zu reagieren, zu feige zu boykottieren
Menschen verachtend, Menschen verfrachtet
Menschen verachtend, Menschen verfrachtet

Braune Augen, schwarzes Haar, schwerer Stand
Auch hier in diesem Land
Weiß ist nicht gleich weiß
Wir sehen Parolen an der Wand
Geld auf die Hand
Mach meinen Kumpel nicht an
Wer hält sich schon daran

Weiße Überheblichkeit, jeder Mensch ist gleich
Der Weiße ist gleicher",Mass Aller Dinge,1989
