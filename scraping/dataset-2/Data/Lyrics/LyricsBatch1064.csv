Susan Silo,"He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around",History,2008
Susan Sutton Trio,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1989
Susan Sutton Trio,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1993
Susan Tedeschi,"If I attend church all day Sunday
Lord I come back home and want to raise hell all day Monday
Lord it ain't nobody's business if I do

If my baby comes up to me and says I ain't got no money
I just got to reach into my pocket
And say take all of my money honey
Ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do

Ain't nobody's business, it just ain't nobody's business
Oh It ain't nobody's business what I do
Ain't nobody's business if I do

If I ever get the notion to jump off into the Atlantic Ocean
It ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do
Me and my baby we might fuss and fight
But with the Lord's help I know everything is gonna be alright
Oh and it ain't nobody's business what we do

 You said you were hurting
 You almost lost your mind
 Cause the girl you love she hurts you all the time
 When things go wrong. go wrong with you

 Oh you better put her down
 Cause the girl you love

 Now she loves another man and boy I love you
 But oh I know that you love her

Susan Tedeschi,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder lightning was desire
This old house would have burnt down, oh, a long time ago

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing, Lord, I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl, oh, I had me a cowboy
He wasn't much to look at, just a free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
Those years just flow by like a broken down dam

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing, Lord, I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear all their buzzing
I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
Come home in the evening and have nothing to say

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing, Lord, I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

Believing in this living is a hard road to hold
Oh, believing in this living, oh, is, oh, it's so hard

To believe in this living is just a hard, oh, so hard way to go",Angel from Montgomery,1998

Susan Tedeschi,"When I close my eyes
All I see is your face
You've got me going so crazy
Just to feel your warm embrace

We all need somebody
And I never knew
I needed somebody
Til I found you

You make me feel so alive
A fellilng sent from above
Like time out of mind
When I feel your sweet love

We all need somebody
And I never knew
I needed somebody
Til I found you

A bus ain't no home
But there's a gypsy in me
Always searching for someone
Or something to set me free

I close my eyes

thinking about our last long talk
Been sitting here at this table at your favorite restaurant
Been hoping I could meet you here so that I could make this perfectly clear

I'm so alone, ohhhh
I'm so lonely baby and I need to say that
I know I was wrong, ohhhh and I'm asking you to come back home
Don't want to be here alone

Your sweet body baby, tears are streaming down my face, yeah
go on and make your mind up-your mind up
I ain't got no where to be right now, baby
But loving you's a long, long way from here
and all I ask of you my dear
Is maybe you would reconsider all the love you've missed since you've been gone

I'm so alone, ohhh
I'm so lonely baby, and I need to say that I know I was wrong, I was so wrong
And I'm asking you to come back home, don't want to be here alone

I know I was the fist to say good-bye, I was a fool baby
Look at these tears in my eyes

Peaceful slumber wakes my eyes

Filling my heart with wishful dreams
No more sorrow fills my canvas
Along this lonely sea

Ships fall off of the horizon

Into a window of your soul
Touching your emotions with sorrow
Of a thousand years of wisdom sold

I know you from someplace

Comes so easy to my pen

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

Year after year in the shrinking walls
Nothing to the exchange
Wood in the smiles at the holidays
And your kiss that fit me strange

What comes so hard from history
Comes so easy to my pen

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

You gave the truth to the lie, turned your eyes to the sky
Looked away when I looked your way
There's a myth in the air, it's too late to repair
But you look at me anyway

Now where the kiss and the smile would be
The distance lies instead
Nine hundred miles of what might have been
And a world of things much better left unsaid

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

The distance lies instead

Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lagrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva
Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más
Mi confesión

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó

Susana Rinaldi,"Una calle en Barracas al sur
Una noche de verano
Cuando el cielo es mas azul
Y mas dulzón el canto del barco italiano
Con su luz mortecina, un farol
Con las sombras gambetea
Y en un zaguán esta un galán
Hablando con su amor

Y, desde el fondo del dock
Gimiendo en lánguido lamento
El eco trae un acento
De un monótono acordeón.
y cruza el cielo un aullido
De algún perro vagabundo
Y un reo meditabundo va silbando esta canción
Una calle, un farol, ella y el

Y llegando sigilosa
La sombra del hombre aquel
A quien infiel dejo una vez la ingrata moza
Un gemido y un grito mortal
y brillando entre las sombras
El relumbrón con que un facon
Da su tajo fatal
Y, desde el fondo del dock",Silbando,2007

Susanna,"A troubled mind in search
Of a bright neon bay
I swim to shore
The only route to take
Is perfection itself
The stars lead the way

As waves make oceans complete
Fate is the shell of my beat
O how I feel all that I need
Under my thoughts under my fears

Little things I know they?re real

They make my soul complete

Little things and all they bring
Are fragments bitter sweet

Little things not everything
'Cause glitter is no goal
Simple things are all I need
a friend to guide to hold

If you should go

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve

Susanna and the Magical Orchestra,"I've tried to wrap my mind around the thought of you
I stretched myself so far I nearly come unglued
You hold the universe inside your hands
Still you thought of me

Is there no limit to your love for me
As shallow as this selfish heart can be
You are the maker of reality

And I stand in awe
You are God

Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I

You're every reason for my heart to hope
Creator of the things I've yet to know
You are the river for my thirsty soul
You are my desire
You are God

Susanna and the Magical Orchestra,"There was a girl in Paris
Whom he sent a letter to
Hoping she would answer back
Now wasn't that a fool

Hardy notion on the part of
Sometimes lonely musician
Acting out a whim is only good
For a condition of the heart

There was a dame from London
Who insisted that he love her
Then left him for a real prince from Arabia
Now isn't that a shame that sometimes money
Buys you everything and nothing
Love, it only seems to buy
A terminal condition of the heart

Oh, thinking about you driving me crazy
Oh, my friends all say, it's just a phase
But, oh, every day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a woman from the ghetto
Who made funny faces just like Clara Bow
Now was I to know that she would wear
The same Cologne as you
And giggle the same giggle that you do
Whenever I would act a fool
The fool with a condition of the heart

Oh, thinking about you driving me crazy
Oh, my friends all say, it's just a phase
But oh every single day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

Susanna Clark,"Elijah came to Texas 
To build his family a home 
With his wife and new baby 
And what little goods that they owned 
Had a good yoke of oxen 
And hand tools for clearing the land 
And he built him a church 
'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
All of his children when there 
Worshiped here through the years 
On down to my granddad 
He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here 
It's where I was baptized 
And where I took me a wife 
And if I have my say so 
That's where I'll rest when it's time 

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead and I'm gone 
Won't you carry me home 
To that little white church 
In my daddy's home town 

'Cause Lord knows I'm some kind of sinner 
But I've done come this far 
And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down 
This east Texas red dirt 
Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
And a hired hand named Regan 
First made me understand 
And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land

Susanna Clark,"Me and Bill there we both come from Georgia 
Met Hank out in New Mexico 
We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa 
We hear that he's payin' in gold 

I guess a man's got to do what he's best at 
Ain't found nothin' better so far 
Been called mercenaries and men with no country 
Just soldiers in search of a war 

[Chorus:] 
And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

When this war is over might go back to Georgia 
And settle down quiet some where 
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile 
Heard tell there's some trouble down there

Susanna Hoffs,"If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Let it be like they said it would be
Me loving you girl and you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely, to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely, to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

Run to me whenever you're lonely, to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder

Susanna Hoffs,"You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cause I'm in love with you
And I wouldn't want you doin' things, you don't want to do
Oh you know, I've always wanted you to be in love with me
And it took so long to realize, the way things have to be

I wanted to live in a dream that couldn't be real
And I'm starting to understand now the way that you feel
You say, you don't
You say, you don't

You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cause I have got the time
To wait in case someday, you maybe change your mind
I've decided not to make the same mistakes this time around
As I'm tired of having heartaches, I've been thinking and I've found

I don't want to live in a dream, I want somethin' real
And I think I understand now the way that you feel
You say you don't, you say you don't
You say you don't

You say, you don't
You say, you don't

You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me, I'm not in love with you
I just want us to do the things, we both want to do
Though I've got this special feelin', I'd be wrong to call it love
For the word entails a few things that I would be well rid of

I've no need to live in a dream, it's finally real
And I hope you now understand this feelin' I feel
You say, you don't
You say, you don't

You say, you don't love me
You say, you don't love me

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

How long has this been going on?

Finding another world.

What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder

Do you still think you could hack it?

Or just another nice place to visit?

Do you miss the strain? The traffic, the tension
Do you view your new terrain
With a touch of condescension on this quiet street?

Is it really as sweet as it seems out here?
Do you dream your dreams out here or is that passe?
Do you miss the scene? The frenzy, the faces

Did you trade the whole parade
For a pair of parking places?
If you had the choice would you still choose to do it all again?

Drive a mile through solid granite
Thrive in all extremes of weather

Tracked the comets in the distance
But we're overcome with blindness
By an act of human kindness

We have ventured where
None have gone before us
But in matters fundamental
We are patterned on an old design
Welcome back Tyrannosaurus
Evolution is a state of mind

We have filled the halls of science
With the bones of mighty giants
They'd all been there for generations
Buried under our foundations

It's a page right out of history
Everything is still a mystery
All except for one distinction
We can stop our own extinction

We have set ourselves apart
From all that's gone before us
But in matters fundamental
We are victims of an old design

Maybe we can get it right this time

On every corner a gladiator is begging for another century
When no one cut your tongue to know nothing and to know it all
To be both the animal and god

It's easier to cry and harder to laugh,

They change when you don't seem to notice
All of a sudden, wind grows cold
And then the snowflakes start to fall
It's kinda like when fell in love with you
I, I didn't even notice when you didn't love me anymore
There's a blue, there's a blue sky on my left and a pink sky on my right
And I'm driving down the 92 where the bridge looks like it touches the sky
And I'm thinking to myself
Where did all the time go
And why can't I remember
What it was like when I was young

Seasons change
And you grow a little older
Nothing stays the same
The past becomes the future
Seasons change
And you grow a little older
No one stays the same
And my heart grows a little colder

Of some suburban shopping mall
And I'm dressed in my work uniform making friends with all
The vacant cars
And I'm thinking to myself
I gotta make a big decision today and I hope I choose a better tomorrow
Rather than a better yesterday

And you grow a little older
Nothing stays the same
The past becomes the future

And you grow a little older

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain

And dancing in the rain

There was some place wild and green
And a child in a village I passed through
There are places that I've traveled
And so many things I've seen
And it all fades away but you

I was sliding down a mountain
I was burning in the sun
I was crying with amazement at the view
I was capturing a moment
But when all is said and done
Well, it all fades away but you

It all fades away, it all fades away
It all fades away but you

I have sailed across the oceans
Past the cities and the farms
On a neverending quest for something new
And the only things that mattered
Were the four days in your arms
'Cause it all fades away but you

It all fades away, it all fades away
It all fades away but you

There is one thing that's eternal
That cannot be torn apart
There is one thing that remains forever true
Past the thinking, past the breathing
Past the beating of my heart
It will all fade away but you

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange

An attic for the past things that hang over us
There's a room for the elephants, a den for the ghosts
A parlor for when we pretend to be hosts

Sutton Foster,"I met a man without a dollar to his name
Who had no traits of any value but his smile
I met a man who had no yearn or claim to fame
Who was content to let life pass him for a while
And I was sure that all I ever wanted
Was a life like the movie stars led
And he kissed me right here, and he said

""I'll give you stars and the moon and a soul to guide you
And a promise I'll never go
I'll give you hope to bring out all the life inside you
And the strength that will help you grow
I'll give you truth and a future that's twenty times better
Than any Hollywood plot""
And I thought, ""You know, I'd rather have a yacht""

I met a man who lived his life out on the road
Who left a wife and kids in Portland on a whim
I met a man whose fire and passion always showed
Who asked if I could spare a week to ride with him
But I was sure that all I ever wanted
Was a life that was scripted and planned
And he said, ""But you don't understand""

""I'll give you stars and the moon and the open highway
And a river beneath your feet
I'll give you days full of dreams if you travel my way
And a summer you can't repeat
I'll give you nights full of passion and days of adventure
No strings, just warm summer rain""
And I thought, ""You know, I'd rather have champagne""

I met a man who had a fortune in the bank
Who had retired at age thirty, set for life
I met a man and didn't know which stars to thank
And then he asked one day if I would be his wife
And I looked up, and all that I could think of
Was the life I had dreamt I would live
And I said to him, ""What will you give?""

""I'll give you cars and a townhouse in Turtle Bay
And a fur and a diamond ring
And we'll get married in Spain on my yacht today
And we'll honeymoon in Beijing
And you'll meet stars at the parties I throw in my villas
In nice and Paris in June""

And I got my yacht

Suzanne,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me. 
I once was lost but now I'm found, 
Was blind but now I see. 

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear, 
The hour I first believed. 

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home. 

When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun; 
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo

But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Suzanne Pittson,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1999
Suzanne Pleshette,"Hush, my little one; you must be exhausted.
Sleep, my little Kovu
Let your dreams take wing
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king
I've been exiled, persucuted
Left alone with no defense
When I think of what that brute did
I get a little tense
But I dream a dream so pretty
That I don't feel so depressed
'Cause it soothes my inner kitty
And it helps me get some rest
The sound of Simba's dying gasp
His daughter squealing in my grasp
His lionesses' mournful cry
That's my lullaby
Now the past I've tried forgetting
And my foes I could forgive
Trouble is I knows it's petty
But I hate to let them live
So you found yourself somebody who'd chase Simba up a tree
Oh, the battle may be bloody, but that kind of works for me
The melody of angry growls
A counterpoint of painful howls
A symphony of death, oh my!
That's my lullaby
Scar is gone... but Zira's still around
To love this little lad
Till he learns to be a killer
With a lust for being bad!
Sleep, ya little termite!
Uh-- I mean, precious little thing!
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king!
The pounding of the drums of war
The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar
The joy of vengeance

And then our flag will fly
Against a blood-red sky

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why.""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down.

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

Well the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan.

And she said, ""I have swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground.

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again.

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange.""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside.

And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word

Holding one thing
A small white wooden horse
I'd been holding inside

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

And in the night the walls disappeared
In the day they returned
'I want to be a rider like my father'
Were the only words I could say

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

Alive
And I fell under
A moving piece of sun
Freedom

I came out of the darkness
Holding one thing
I know I have this power
I'm afraid I may be killed

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

Suzanne Vega,"Solitude stands by the window
She turns her head as I walk in the room
I can see by her eyes she's been waiting
Standing in the slant of the late afternoon

And she turns to me with her hand extended
Her palm is split with a flower with a flame

Solitude stands in the doorway
And I'm struck once again by her black silhouette
By her long cool stare and her silence
I suddenly remember each time we've met

And she turns to me with her hand extended
Her palm is split with a flower with a flame

And she says ""I've come to set a twisted thing straight""
And she says ""I've come to lighten this dark heart""
And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear
And I say ""I've never thought of finding you here""

I turn to the crowd as they're watching
They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm
I wanted to be in there among them
I see how their eyes are gathered into one

Her palm is split with a flower with a flame

Suzanne Vega,"There's a sound
Across the alley
Of cold metal
Touching skin

And you can see
If you look in her window
That she has gone and cut
Her hair again

In straight lines
Straight lines

Those soft golden lights in the morning
Are now on her wooden floor
The wind has swept them through the apartment
She don't need them

Any more
Any more
Any more

She's cut down
On her lovers
Though she still dreams
Of them at night

She's growing straight lines
Where once were flowers
She is streamlined
She is taking the shade down
From the light

To see the straight lines
Straight lines

She wants to cut through the circles
That she has lived in before
She wants to finally kill the delusions
She won't need them

Any more
Any more
Any more

But there's a sound
Across the alley
Of cold metal
Too close to the bone

The face of a woman
Finally alone

Behind straight lines
Straight lines",Straight Lines,1992
Suzanne Vega,"I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice

And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began

I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train",Tom's Diner,1992
Suzanne Vega,"I believe right now if I could
I would swallow you whole
I would leave only bones and teeth
We could see what was underneath
And you would be free then

Salt wearing down to the bone
Like sand against the stone
Against the shoreline

I am friend to the undertow
I take you in, I don't let go
And now I have you

I wanted to learn all the secrets
From the edge of a knife
From the point of a needle
From a diamond
From a bullet in flight
I would be free then

I am friend to the undertow
I take you in, I don't let go
And now I have you

I wanted to see how it would feel
To be that sleek
And instead I find this hunger's
Made me weak

Suzanne Vega,"When blood sees blood
Of its own
It sings to see itself again
It sings to hear the voice it's known
It sings to recognize the face

One body split and passed along the line
From the shoulder to the hip
I know these bones as being mine
And the curving of the lip

And my question to you is:
How did this come to pass?
How did this one life fall so far and fast?

Some are lean and some with grace, and some without;
All tell the story that repeats
Of a child who had been left alone at birth
Left to fend and taught to fight

See his eyes and how they start with light
Getting colder as the pictures go
Did he carry his bad luck upon his back?
That bad luck we've all come to know

How did this one life fall so far and fast?

one thing I know
this pain will go


step through all that's left to feel
I wait to meet my love made real


don't move don't touch 
don't talk so much


strip and find the place to kneel
I wait to meet my love made real


one thing I know 

this day will go 

don't touch don't talk crawl the wall
she's the ticket to the future don't listen down the hall
you can say your prayer to the head of this bed
when it begins at your knees and goes right to your head


birth-day 

strap me down from wrist to heel
I wait to meet my love made real


one thing I know
this day will go


shake all over like an old sick dog
there's a needle here needle there tremble in the fog
it's a tight squeeze vice grip ice and fire
she's a hot little treasure and the wave goes higher

I only turned to see
What hand had set this inner field alight
Against the flame I see
The outline of a man against a night

Take back your sympathy
I do not need to drink that bitter stuff
I'd rather break the thread
That bound us close, and say we called a bluff

A casual match
In a very dry field
What could be
The season's yield?

My eyes have gone to coal
It's nothing I would be concerned about
Observe the moment
When the heat of love becomes the chill of doubt

A casual match
In a very dry field
Fire and ash
Is the season's yield

We look for a sign
But it is not revealed
Fire and ash is the
Season's yield",Casual Match,1996
Suzanne Vega,"The sign said ""Head shots""
And that was all,
A picture of a boy
And a number you could call,
Two eyes in the shade
A mouth so sad and small,
It's strange the way a shadow
Can fall across the wall, 
And make the difference 
In what you see
Ah... 

He's just a poster, but
He's everywhere,
A face under a street lamp
Ripped and hanging in the air,
Turn the corner
And he's still there,
Watching all the people
Who are passing unaware,
Is there a judgment
In what he sees?
Ah... 

On a day
As cold
And gray
As today...

The sign says ""Head shots""
It's all I see,
A boy becomes a picture
Of guilt and sympathy,
And so I think of you 
In memory
Of the days we were together,
And I knew that you loved me
That was the difference
In what we see,
But that's history...
Ah...",Headshots,1996
Suzanne Vega,"The ceiling had a painting on it
In our room in France
So we were living underneath 
Some angels in a dance

My husband was not feeling well
And so we went to bed
He woke up complaining
Of an aching in his head

He said a hundred people
Had come through our room that night
That one by one the old and young
Asked if he was all right

One by one the old and young
Lined up to touch his hand
He spent the night explaining
They had come to the wrong man

The concierge was less than helpful
When we asked her the next day
With coffee and a magazine
We went to the desk to pay

""What happened in that room?"" he asked
""A death or something strange?""
She smiled at him politely
And returned to him his change

Well, what I'd like to know
And this will be a mystery,
Is with all the people in that room
Why none appeared to me?

Our hair becomes entwined

The threads of recent slumbers

Her stockings and her skin.

She'd ask me to go dance
But something in the way she laughed
Told me I had no chance

Was that she was never nice
I'd say she was very
I just did not see the price

And passion does begin?

Makes the room begin to spin.

To be easily bruised

When she's so easily amused?

Suzanne Vega,"I heard it said somewhere that one day all good things come to an end.
I turn around to see you. And if I do or not, it all depends.
I was born the day I met you,
Lived a while when you loved me,
Died a little when we broke apart.
Yesterday, it would have mattered.
Now today, it doesn't mean a thing.
All my hopes and dreams are shattered now.

I'm in a lonely place without you.
I'm in a lonely place without you.

I walk the streets alone at night sometimes and think about you.
I look as strangers pass, and wonder how I'll live without your love.
I was born the day I met you,
Lived a little when you loved me,
Died a little when we broke apart.
Suddenly, this world's no longer bright.
I'm alone and lonely every night.
Won't you bring back your love that's out of sight?

I'm in a lonely place without you.
I'm in a lonely place without you.",In a Lonely Place,2001
Suzanne Vega,"I'll never be your Maggie May
The one you loved and left behind
The face you see in light of day
And then you cast away
That isn't me in that bed you'll find

I'd rather take myself away
Be like those ladies in Japan
Rather paint myself a face
Conjure up some grace
Or be the eyes behind a fan

[Chorus]

And so you go
No girl could say no
To you

There's the way we may appear
But that will change from day to night
Would you ever see within?
Underneath the skin?
Could I believe you had that sight?

[Chorus]

I'll never be your Maggie May
The one you loved and then forgot
I'll love you first and let you go
Because it must be so
And you'll forgive or you will not

And so a woman leaves a man
And so a world turns on it's end
So I'll see your face in dreams
Where nothing's what it seems
You still appear some kind of friend

[Chorus]",(I'll Never Be) Your Maggie May,2001
Suzanne Vega,"I dreamed you were a rich man
And that I had no place to go
I came to you to see if you would take me in
Through golden curtains you told me you'd let me know.

Well, you drink for ten and you smoke for twenty
And your fickle heart will never be true
But still I feel the wind in from the harbor
That's when I know the longing for you
When I know the old longing for you.

I saw you in my mind's eye
You were laid out on your final day
I stood in line to see that handsome face once more
It had been so dear to me, and I kissed you as you lay
You were so dear, I kissed you as you lay.

Now, whenever I do travel
If to Portugal, England, or Spain
As I do walk by the shipyards and the harbors
I smell the salt, and the bay rum of your ghost again
I know the salt, and the bay rum, you beside me again.",Harbor Song,2001
Suzanne Vega,"Ooh
If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range I guess
With silencer and stun

But I feel more like a needle
Always pulling on the thread
Always making the same point again
And wondering if you heard what I just said

If you were a weapon
A hammer's what you'd be
Blunt and heavy at the end
And coming down on me

But I've concealed a weapon
In a pocket knife attack
All folded up inside until you see the shine
And then you'll want it back

Ooh
If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range I guess

Obscure the view in front of you

Austerity? or just give in
To endless appetite,
Embrace that white oblivion?

Am I a toy on a tray

While you sit so royal
Then I'm put away?

Held myself above the crowd
Now I am low on the ground.

From here I look around to see
What avenues belong to me
I can't tell what I've found.

Now what would You have me do
I ask you please?
I wait to hear.

The mother, and the matador,
The mystic, all were here before,
Like me, to stare You down.

You appear without a face,
Disappear, but leave your trace,
I feel your unseen frown.

Now what would you have me do
I ask you please?
I wait to hear
Your voice,
The word,
You say.
I wait to see your sign
Would I
Obey?

I look for you in heathered moor,
The desert, and the ocean floor
How low does one heart go.

Looking for your fingerprints
I find them in coincidence,
And make my faith to grow.

Forgive me all my blindnesses
My weakness and unkindnesses
As yet unbending still.

Struggling so hard to see
My fist against eternity
And will you break my will?

Now what would you have me do
I ask you please?

You say

To see your sign

Suzanne Vega,"She'd come to my house
And dance in the hall
With the music up loud
Against the light on the wall

I danced beside her
Feeling no shame
We were in costume
And this was a game

She'd put on her skirt
Of layers of chiffon
The top of the umbrella had come off
So I put that on

We'd dance together then
An awkward ballet
She was 20 years older than I was
But still we did play

She was 20 years older than me
And many times my size
But it's her little feet I remember
And the look in her eyes

Once when I saw her
She made me a doll
Of ribbon and paper and ink
And lace, I recall

I danced beside her
Feeling no shame
We were in costume
And this was a game

I think of her now I'm older
I still love to dance
Something will shine through the body
If you give it a chance",Priscilla,2001

Bleach it clean to a vinegar shine

Mama's a headful of bees

Heal the cut we call husband and wife

Suzanne Vega,"Black on the red and the red on the black.
It's a tic of a tired mind.
Come and sit down, won't you try your luck.
See if you unwind.

Never use your threes and twos.
Follow superstition.
Otherwise you are going to lose.
Compulsion makes you listen.

Take what's wrong, and make it go right.
Weave it like a prayer.
Wonder if you you'll spend the night?
Playing solitaire?

Do it again, when you find you're all done.
Like an idiot savant.
Shuffle up your luck. You see, you almost won.
Now wrestle down what you want.

Jack on the Queen, and the ten on the Jack.
It's a happy repetition.
You and your fate in a kind of check-mate.
And you are your only competition.

Suzanne Vega,"The reproach in your daughter's most beautiful face
Made me wonder just how she could know
Of that something that happened between you and me
So much more than a long time ago

Her mother, I can see, lives within her still
Cause she looked at me with her eyes
Though I had only just met her right then
I feel that she peeled back my guilty disguise

Did I break the thread, or did you break the thread?
Well at this point we could ask who cares
As for the promises broken and frayed
It's 19 years late for repairs

The grey pewter vase held the deep red rose,
One piece of coral shone white,
By the brass candlestick near your red velvet coat,
Is everything I can recall of one night

Will you please tell me why I remember these things
After all of this time, I don't know
I must have left all those feelings inside
Cause that year I had no courage to show

Was I the name you could never pronounce?
Or did I even figure at all?
All of this happened before she was born
Did I shadow her young pencil marks on the wall

Still I am sure I was only but one
Of a number who darkened that door
Of your home and your hearth and your family and wife
Who'd been darkened so often before

To each other, they know what they mean
Somewhere, their future is still yet to come
In ways that are yet as of now unforeseen",Songs in Red and Gray,2001
Suzanne Vega,"Consider me a widow, boys
And I will tell you why.
It's not the man, but it's the marriage
That was drowned.

So I walk the walk
And wait with watchful eye out to the sky,
Looking for a kind of vessel
I have never found.

Though I saw it splinter
I keep looking out to sea,
Like a dog with little sense,
I keep returning,

To the very area where
I did see the thing go down
As if there's something at the site
I should be learning.

That line is the horizon.
We watch the wind and set the sail,
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail.

If I tell the truth
Then I will have to tell you this
Though I grieve (and I believe
I feel it truly)

But I knew that ship was empty
By the time it hit the rocks,
We could not hold on
When fate became unruly.

So consider me a widow, boys,
And I have told you why.
Does the weather say
A better day is nearing?

I'll set my house in order now
And wait upon the Will
It's clear that I need
Better skill in steering

But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail.",Widow's Walk,2001
Suzanne Vega,"The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
He said, ""I am not fighting for you any more""
And the queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why?""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

Oh the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

She said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside and often I've bled""
And he laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""And tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone and you are never revealed?
But I won't march again upon your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see

And the sun, it was gold though the sky it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
And she took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
The battle continued on

She knows he's arrived
She feels this with no introduction

What she doesn't want to know

She knows the smell
Of that life he can't tell
Of the fires and the flesh and confusion
Inside his brain
It's never the same
Though he tries to maintain the illusion

Crowd the day with unrelated histories
Each year leaves its unresolving fantasies

To hang around each corner
Hang around each street

Thick with ghosts, the wind whips round in circuitries
Carrying words as strangers exchange pleasantries
Do they intrude upon your private reveries?

As they meet you on each corner
Meet you on each street

Watch for daily braveries
Notice newfound courtesies
Finger sudden legacies

As they clean up every corner
Wash down every street

Mark the month and all its anniversaries
Put away the draft of all your eulogies
Clear the way for all your private memories

Meet you on each street

Salty tissues through the years
Spread them in the sun to dry
Diamonds from each time you cry

I will treasure all your teeth
Your laughter and the pearls beneath
Keep them in a cardboard box
Through the tickings and the tocks

I will gather all your hair
Floating in the sultry air
We will make a braid of gold
For you to keep when you are old

Sheet of silk and soul within
Put this kiss upon your brow
Treasure you as you are now",As You Are Now,2007

And I ask
I am asking you
Asking you if you
Might still want me
And I ask
I am asking you
Asking you if you
Might still want me

Once you said
I'm made of fine stuff
I've been corrupted
And taken enough

Now you appear
Making your claim
Inside my heart
Is the sign of your name

In a path to your ear

Bitten my soul

Watched it grow, watched it grow
Watched it as it struggled so

And watched it feed
And grow beyond

In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

Nice to see you""

I pour the milk

I open

While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice...

And of the midnight picnic

Before the rain began...

in my backyard

I believe you'll
never leave

of the afternoon
along a windowsill

in an old red cart

in the tall grass 
by the sea

Cause she looked at me with her eyes
Though I had only just met her right then
I feel that she peeled back my guilty disguise

Well at this point we could ask who cares
As for the promises broken and frayed
It's 19 years late for repairs

One piece of coral shone white
By the brass candlestick near your red velvet coat
Is everything I can recall of one night

Will you please tell me why I remember these things
After all of this time, I don't know
I must have left all those feelings inside
'Cause that year I had no courage to show

Was I the name you could never pronounce?
Or did I even figure at all?
All of this happened before she was born
Did I shadow her young pencil marks on the wall

Still I am sure I was only but one
Of a number who darkened that door
Of your home and your hearth and your family and wife
Who'd been darkened so often before

And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

And she said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the Queen went on strangely in the solitude she preferred

Over there the petticoats of ladies of virtue

They gleam with a luster they don't have today

I knew that ship was empty by the time it hit the rocks,
Cause we could not hold on when fate became unruly.

Does the weather say a better day is nearing?

Suzi Jane Hokom,"Don Lowance, the man who plays guitar with me, and I
Were born in a small town
And we kinda think it was a different sort of small
Town because in our town, we had a dragon and people
Used to make up stories about the dragon

Sinse the stories were made up most of them started:
""Once upon a time, there was a very friendly dragon""
Except people didn't have any way of knowing that the
Dragon was friendly so they shot at him with guns and
Threw rocks at him. And the dragon being a sort of a
Poor sport, he ate a lot of those people up

Now, the dragon was messing up their senses, something
Fierce until one day he wandered into the store that
Sold spirits, and after making a fast brunch of the
Owner and four emplyees, he broke into this wine
Barrel
And that did it, from that day on the dragon was not
Only a friendly dragon, he was a happy friendly dragon

And now all he does is walk up and down the streets of
Our small town and tap people on their shoulders and
Ask them for a little change so he can buy some of that
Stuff that he likes better than people

Buddy can you spare a dime
For a little glass of wine
Buddy don't you pity me
Just one drink then I'll be
In a world all my own
The only place I call home
Where no hurt can get to me
And no one but me can see

Pretty flowers dance and sing
Laughter is a common thing
Where no hate has ever been
'Cause I won't let it in
By the warm purple flame
Every little grape calls my name
As it climbs on the fire
And makes the fire burn higher

Higher than it's ever been
Time and space mean nothing then
I fall about a mile or two
So pardon me if I ask you
Buddy can you spare a dime

And that's the story of the little town that Don and I
Was born in and our dragon, fairly strange story",First Street Blues [#],2013

Suzi Quatro,"Say, sugar-honey you've gotta act like me
Well, you can take a passion-lovin' panther
Make him week at the knees
You can shake him like a rattle, and roll him like a dice
But, honey, you know I'm too big to be nice
I gave away my independence to all them evil guys
And when I got too hot they put my lips on ice
Now I don't hold out with those wise-guys. I see through their disguise
'Cause, honey, you know I'm too big to be fooled twice
Well, I don't know all the answers, but I guess I know my share
And I've taken all the chances, but I never really care

Because I'm too big to be used
You know I'm too big for my boots
You know I'm too big to be abused
And honey...I never lose!
Now listen baby, watch the way you walk
And when it comes to talkin', watch the way you talk
He'll tear ya down and break ya and he'll make you if he can
But, honey, you're too big, too big for that man

You know he can't understand ya. You're breakin' all the rules
He's tried so hard to land ya. Just send him back to school
Because you're too big to be used
You know you're too big for your boots
You know you're too big to be abused

I had no place to call my own
Small hotel and smokin' cigarettes
Noboby knows what a pain it gets

Do you believe when I tell you
That lonely is the hardest
Do you believe when I tell you
That lonely is the hardest state of all

Count the hours 'til the morning light
Pin up photographs on empty walls
riting poems to no one at all

Do you believe when I tell you
That lonely is the hardest
Do you believe when I tell you
That lonely is the hardest state of all

Seems everybody has someplace to go
Look in the mirror with far away eyes
Cry in silence at a wasted life

That lonely is the hardest state of all",Lonely Is the Hardest,1980
Suzi Quatro,"She spent the whole of last summer
Lookin' out for a six foot two.
She gave them all a good chance

She was cool so she told 'em what to do.
What she needs is a real special guy
And if you knew her you would never wonder why.
When you see her now you'll see her with a six foot two.

She never takes a chance
She doesn't need romance.
Her love is - rock hard -
She never takes a chance.
She never dates to dance

Her love is - rock hard -
She goes to parties
With a boyfriend hangin' on her arm

No-one give her any lip
No-one does her any harm
All the other girls hangin' in the hall.
She got the boys all wishin' they could call

She starts makin' out and someone's ringin# on the fire alarm.
She never takes a chance

Suzi Quatro,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
The moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie baby, you're my flame""
And I give you fever
Fever when we're kissing
Fever with our flaming youth
Fever
I'm on fire
Fever yeah I burn forsooth

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever
When you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever 'til you sizzle
Fever
What a lovely way to burn [x8]",Fever,2003
Suzi Quatro,"In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on HighWay 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected
And steppin' out over the line
Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Wendy let me in I want to be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wraps your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Will you walk with me out on the wire
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if your love is wild
Girl I want to know if love is real
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach on a mist
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
The highway's jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go
And we'll walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us
Baby we were born to run",Born to Run,2003

I'll drive you insane.
So tear me apart if you want to win my heart. 
Well I've been seen in the back of a limousine

I may not own it but it's bigger than you've ever seen
She'll ride around and think she's a star

If you please she's a tease you won't get far.
So tear me apart if you want to win my heart

Tear me apart if you ever want to win my heart.
I'll make your legs start shakin' everytime you hear my name

So tear me apart if you want to win my heart

Staring back at me
Is my new friend desperation
