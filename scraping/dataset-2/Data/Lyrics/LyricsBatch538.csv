Keke Wyatt,"It's crazy I know just how you feel
So alone always gone to this useless
Don't let yourself fall apart
Is not a movie is addicted as a drug
You are too scared I won't let it bring me down
It ain't a beauty it's so emotional it's overwhelming

Don't be blinded by love
Cause enough is enough enough
Heard a million stories
Enough is enough enough
You got to let him go
There is no reason to love love
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you
Enough is enough enough
Is tearing you apart

Lately I know times you have been empty
So lone without the calls it's confusing
Don't let it disturb your mind
You can lose it I have seen it with my eyes
It's abusing and different disguise
Some excuses it can leave you so hurt and miserable
Without a question

Don't be blinded by love
Cause enough is enough enough
Heard a million stories
Enough is enough enough
You got to let him go
There is no reason to love love
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you
Enough is enough enough
Is tearing you apart

I know love that you do some crazy things
Emotions be something with the shame
Ends cold out of blue, assumption in the face
I hope you will find someone that cares about you girl
Who respect you who appreciates you and holds it down for you
Gotta know how much you truly worth
Enough is enough

Don't be blinded by love
Cause enough is enough enough
Heard a million stories
Enough is enough enough
You got to let him go
There is no reason to love love
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you
Enough is enough enough
Is tearing you apart",Enough,2011
Keke Wyatt,"Why should I feel discouraged
And why should the shadows come
And why should my heart be lonely
And know for heaven and hope
When Jesus sees my portion
A constant friend he is
For His eye is on the sparrow
I know He watches over me

Why should I feel discouraged
And why should the shadows come

And why should my heart be lonely
And know for heaven and hope
When Jesus sees my portion
A constant friend he is
For His eye is on the sparrow
I know He watches over me
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
God, God's eye is on the sparrow",His Eye Is on the Sparrow,2011
Keke Wyatt,"Darling when I look into your eyes the love I see can’t be denied
Oh baby you are so fine I am glad to know that YOU ARE MINE

[Chorus]
You make me feel like flower I need a shower
So baby rain on me every minute every hour

Keke Wyatt,"Look me in my eyes mirror
'Cause I've seen that look before
Tell me what's inside mirror
'Cause we both agreed no more

We were so close to getting over him
Now you're telling me we're going back
Again in

How could you
Betray me
And take my heart back through that door

Oh mirror

We both deserve so much more

How could you

Keke Wyatt,"Just picture I met you at baggage claim
I can't believe that you are leaving me again
Just when I started to think that you are really here with me
Time to pack for long distance
Out of block how does it go doesn't help me much

My soul out of touch
Why can't you stay, extended trip just for one more day
I know is messed up for me to say
The storm keeps you here let it rain
Some reason till you came baby

I hold you miss your name
Pray that there is traffic when you are on your way
Every green light on the street turns to red
Baby I hope you'll miss your plane
Your suitcase is ? you are ready to go

I use my body like a ? just to think you can go
We start to make love you, a reason to be late
Out of block how does it go doesn't help me much
My soul out of touch
Why can't you stay, extended trip just for one more day

I know is messed up for me to say
The storm keeps you here let it rain
Some reason till you came baby
I hope you'll miss your plane
Pray that your pilot don't show up today

And for some reason, something to land
Baby I hope you'll miss your plane
I will never wish you bad baby
But I hope everything goes wrong today
Gets you back here, so you could be here with me

It's hard for em to see you leave
At the end of the day I just want you to stay
Pray that your pilot don't show up today
And for some reason, something to land
Baby I hope you'll miss your plane

The storm keeps you here let it rain
Some reason till you came baby
I hope you'll miss your plane",Miss Your Plane,2011

Keke Wyatt,"Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Will it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please, begging please

If I saw you
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Will it be the same if I, if I saw you in heaven?

Keke Wyatt,"It's been a long time. Yeah, 
Since I've looked in a mirror and liked what I see
It was a hard climb, yeah,
Things are much clearer in my reality and how people see me, yeah
Always feeling ashamed, (Hey), because of what I was told. 
Now I'm taking the ugly, and made it beautiful, yeah

I found me a place, where I ain't doin' nothin', 
But lovin' myself, and everything about me, yeah
Said I found me a place, and it don't even matter, 
What nobody else thinks, 'cause I'm lovin' me, (yeah)

It's been a long time since I sang on a song. 
They said my voice was right, but my curves were all wrong
It's such a hard time when the media chooses who wins or who loses
But I gotta fix what your illusions
Oh, no, no longer feelin' the pain. I'm more than good enough. 
Gave my power away. But now I back and stronger

I found me a place, where I ain't doin' nothin', 
But lovin' myself, and everything about me, yeah 
Said I found me a place, where it don't even matter, 
What nobody else thinks, 'cause I'm lovin' me, (yeah)

If I'm not a size 2, it don't fit you, it's okay,
I refuse to be dismissed because my skin is darker than yours, 
All that power when say ""You're pretty in the face"", if only I could lose some weight, 
Anything you can do, I can do better, 
Made up my mind, won't stop never

I found me a place, where I ain't doin' nothin', 
But lovin' myself, and everything about me, hey
Said I found me a place, where it don't even matter, 
What nobody else thinks, 'cause I'm lovin' me, yeah uh

Open your heart and let my love come in.
I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart

Oh honey now, my love will be so sound, 
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down, 
wear it down, tear it down.
 
This is no fiction, this no act,
This is real, it's a fact.
I'll always belong only to you.
And each day I'll be living to 
Make sure I'm giving you more love and more joy 
than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound,

wear it down, tear it down.
 
As we grow older, no need to fear,
'Cause when you need me I'll be here.
I'll be beside you every step of the way.
A heart that's truthful, and is keeping it youthful

Real funky for you 

When it comes down to me and you 
There's no limit to what we're doing 
Met no one like you, it's been a while 
When I say it's been a while 
This you best believe my child 
I talk to you like you were my best friend 
And I love that you're talking too 
Cause I damn near gave my heart to you 
Those things that make us frown, makes us smile 
(Na, na, na, na) 
So lay your head and rest 
Be happy cause you got the best 
Everyday we get closer it's true 

I can feel us getting closer 
And boy you know I want you 
I can feel us getting closer 
Don't know what I'd do without you, yeah 

I love it when you're here with me 
My days with you are so sweet 
You clear up all the things that's on my mind 
(That's on your mind) 
You know all the right things to do 
So now I give to you my boo 
Your smile seems to take control of me 
God knows what I would do for you 
And what I feel no lie it's true 
I see the future baby 
It's me and you 

This whole friendship thing is cool, but let's take it past that 
Give a Kel Spencer rap cat that's a class act 
We've been friends for a while but your style and your smile 
Makes me want to take it that extra mile 
We can hold hands in the rain or chill in the shade 
Let me know something cause I know you feeling the same 
It'd be real cool, friendship we kept it up 
Now it's time to step it up, change in plans, come on 
Do it nice and Smooth, we both envisioned it right 
Now instead of kissing the sky start kissing this guy 
Hey yo it's real for you what I feel for you 
And I'm gonna make it real ill for you, platinum voice

Why'all want me, come get me
See'mon, what why'all afraid or something
Scared today might be your expiration date or something
I'm made of something larger than life
From trife, so in deaf for tax 
I'm hawking these bullets and dodging his snipe, all right
I'm on the road to being sacked with dough
Kelvin Spencer is what I'm clapping for
Fresh in the streets with the Lex and Rover
But why'all trying to stop the process you know
Cover your chest I'll spray these through your thin vest
Feared like an outlaw from the East, getting stalked by Jim West
On the humbly, why'all trying to come for me
Sending chunks for me to join a gun for me
Don't get it twisty
I'll leave you laying with the tumbleweeds
I'm Loveless partner Kel

Leave a trail of dust and disappear into the sunset
Everyday I'm gonna stay true to me
Ain't much ya'll can do to me
This ain't new to me
I come through the streets, crew
Leave you black and blue, see

Prey on me
They want me
Dead or alive

You know what dog, let's just square off like the Westerns
You know ten paces, turn around and see who's chest burns
For me to hate'cha is not my nature
Erase ya, I'm hard to follow
Being the desperado's my major
The cowboy hat is Yankees fitted
The cowboy boots is Timbs
That horse you call Silver is a chrome Lex with rims
The saloon is a bodega
That leather vest is a low fleece
And the sheriff in this boys is police
We line up empty bean cans
On the fence for target practice
Feared by masses, draw the fastest
Scars on my face to be posted on cactuses
It's cream, mental scheme, all in the green
Spencer for hire, type of guy you want on your team
Why'all gotta realize what's happening
There's more to rapping and
See them outside the saloon back them in
I'm just trying to do shows and pack them in
Want to find out where my gat descend
Poisonous, the confidant man works in silence
So I understand why why'all making noise in this
Why'all young boys in this, I'm wanted

Feel me, spit gold, danger when my clique roll
We shine bright like Senso, big guns let off big blows
Kel the voice of Ghetto, USA needs to be heard
Love and loyalty baby gotta believe in me, word
Check it you shooken, I'll step up while you're looking
Plus for the fame, nice with the game
Why'all weak still sky hooking
Trying to knock the hustle
I'm a flex the muscle
Go ahead bust yours, rush the front door
I run with the big dogs that bite right through the muzzle
I'm pushing my product, Kel Spence the track pimp
Dangerous when I murder bass lines like Shawn Kemp
'Cause my whole game official, my hot ones ain't going to miss you
What they gonna be missing you
If I got to send them kids for you
Hear my heart through my voice
A spark and your moist
Give you a full scholarship to the graveyard and get tossed
Why'all want my corpse laid out for the undertaker to fit me
Dead or alive, but Feds the only way why'all gonna get me
Blow!

Come get me, why'all ain't serious

When we're both still young?
Putting each other down
When we need to climb

You gon' end up like the best.""

Kelela,"8 balls wit a safety pin
I deserve the finer things
Told myself back then
When I used to ride a Schwinn
Now I'm on a tour bus
Going places I ain't never been
Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag
That was way back
Having dreams of a Cadillac
Dog, I had to bounce back
Locked a nigga up
Why they do me like that?
Now I'm on the Jack in the county
Asking mommy for some money
Swear to God she'd do anything for me
Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back
So I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that
Cousin of death anyway
Now I see better day
And I ain't tryna miss a minute, second hour
Living on borrowed time
Can't think about tomorrow
'Cause it's about today
And you know you wanna take my place
Let's get it

You turn around, and now I'm winning
I built it up, from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up, from the ground

Now tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams?
What it takes if you want anything
Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat
So while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep
No cheat sheet, get it out the mud
Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field
My nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes
It's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die
So no try to do, what about you?
Work off, well met, do the same thing too
A lot locked up wishing they was like you
Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June
Been down for a minute and every since sentence
Things ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga
Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came
Was trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain

I tried again, but there's delay
It's more than I can take

And it got to me

And you walk away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around

If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times I feel like giving up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losing faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't pretend with no handling
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, crying out for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusing power
Clock is ticking, hour after hour
Maybe when I throw my hands, I'll holla

All these years and you won’t change inside

If we just face this together
We could drift away in the same boat
Chase the light in the rainbow
Hit 'em like a tornado

We are just a breath away from heaven, heaven
From heaven, heaven
We are, we are
We are, we are so close to heaven
To heaven

Eyes are on me, but you're so polite
I'm just browsin' you never let me leave your side
Roll my eyes so I don't lose my mind
In this land where hell isn't too far behind

We are a breath away from heaven
If we just face this together
We could drift away in the same boat

Kelis,"Somebody made me an offer and I accepted
Forever in debted to weapon
Love, honor, and respected
But his image was different than what his character reflected
Word is he's seven - thirty his hands never dirty
All I know this so called psycho never hurt me
Touch me down to tips, shopping sprees on Fifth
With enough dough that could be carry out on forklifts
Earnt his trust, together till we turn to dust
Until his theory disintegrated and burnt to crust
What? What?

Death to a soft heart
That's what I vow to you
The vows I vow to you
Amazing how it's true
Talk goes on our phone
Just to remind you
That I'm behind you
The FEDS won't find you

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

Mister and Misses, but I wonder where the bliss is
Sealed in blood and Cordion kisses
The shit I witnessed
Would give a bitch morning sickness
Decomposed bodies thrown in the ditches
As for snitches ain't nothing lower than that
Intentions to squeal on your fam make you low as a rat
Got cappos for flaming at those
Lame ass hoes, so you know next time keep your trap close

What would you doubt for?
I'd never lie to you
Of course I'd die for you
I'd be your eye for you
My love won't stop short
I'll raise our sons for you
I'll save our ones for you
Load up your guns for you

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course

The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

Riches, tradition niggas once held dear
Let it be known that your name alone spell fear
Gun for gun, hundred to one forget about it
Petty shit, rise above and get up out it
Could give a shit about it
Time to focus a foe
Many lives bought and sold
Fortunes favor the bold
Connected like phone lines
To racketeering to known crimes
Winners turning long shots to gold mines

The high speed chases
I'll do them just like you
I'll give them dust like you
Turn around and bust like you
Then I'll deserve it
Every time I get high

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

You wanna look pretty though, in my video 
Ol' dirty on the hat and I let you all know

If you stop! I'ma put the killer ants in your pants

Every eye, don't you be watching me

In the ground where you can not be found

You looking at my wrist saying ""its so nice"" 
The price bitch is diamonds shining disco light 
You better help me solve this problem 
Or I'ma get this money and rob them 
Lucky dig when I won the lotto 
Ran up on my car for carrying kilos 
You can call me dirty, and then lift up your skirt 
And you want some of this dirty, god made dirt and dirt bust yo ass 
Stop annoying me, yeah! I play my music loud 
It takes the bastard ol' dirty, to move the crowd 
They say he had his dick in his mouth 
Eddie Murphy told me that back in the house 
But give me my money!

Don't you worry, I said hey. 
Baby I got your money

I taste just like candy..
.. so dance with me

Yo, now let me paint y'all a picture
Fox pimp hard, just quiet like a whisper - don't get it mixed up
Bad little sista; not bad meaning bad but
bad meaning good - DAM I'm so hood
You should see me in them jeans
It's hard to describe and
Being cocky is just a part of the vibe
I might stop and holla and pop my collar
Maybe a little conceited but that's always needed
Love attention when I'm passin by
See I show a little cleavage then I catch his eye
Just the thought of him eatin, I was outside soakin
Duke standin loc'in, mouth wide open
I walked over, lickin my lips
And adjustin my {tits} and switchin my hips
{Shit} he threw his hand on my waist
Looked in my face and said he wanna know how I taste

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

Now just imagine me nude, stretched out
I'll be all over the news if this gets out
So HOT that the press might ban me
Now how bad you wanna know if I'm sweeter then candy?
What would you risk? Would you put up the car?
Taste my na na in the rain on the hood of your car
Or the back of the plane, {nipples} all out
Bent over the sink with my panties in your mouth
When my dark skin complexion steps in
Won't take no questions to get him and the
thought of Fox give him an erection
to get real stiff at the sight of my {tits}
Now we can role play, you be the pilot
I'll be the stewardess boy I ain't knew to this
When I lay on my stomach and throw my legs back
Y'all probably won't know how to act

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me
I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

I'm real sweet like a candy corn
I'm in your thoughts late night when your boys are gone
Picture me, t-shirt, no panties on
Or maybe topless, homie I'm priceless bwoy
The kind of girl that love to talk {shit}
'Specially when I'm on top - the whole show stop
Even though I'm sweet, ain't nuttin sweet
Let me know when you're ready to eat

I taste just like candy.. so dance with me

Kelis,"Saw her on a Friday outside someones dance saloon
She was crying over someone that she felt love much too soon
I said: ""Hey girl don't you cry tonight, let me take you out on this town""
She looked at me and smiled as one last tear splashed of the ground
With half a wink she asked me ""What are you some kind of creep?""
I told her ""No I guess I just feel your vibe is kinda deep""
The moon hung over Soho and I counted 16 stars
I pointed at the brightest one and said ""Now that one's ours""

She's a dandelion up on her hill, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, hold on hold on hold on

I just might be poison but he took me to his roof top
He said ""Are you affraid of hights?"" I said ""No I am not""
He said ""Hey girl don't you lie to me, tell me everythin you feel""
We danced around in circles, he said ""I think we felt somethin real""

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on

Down in Union Square I saw her walking all alone
I walked a little slower just so I remain unknown
She met someone on 17 think she knew him all to well
My little piece of heaven has a secret she won't tell
Without the smile she took his hand and then they walked away
I realised I wouldn't see my girl after today
I fell in love with a dandelion and she's all I ever had
At first she looked so sweet but in the end she tastes so bad

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed
And I hold on hold on hold on, and I hold on hold on hold on
And I tell myself hold on hold on hold on, and hold on hold on hold on

She's a dandelion up on her cliff, above the sea
She's not exactly everythin I thought that she might be
She's a dandelion, she looks like everythin I need
I thought she was a flower but I found out she's a weed

Kelis,"Is it, I loose my cool, every once in a blue moon
Leave a girl stranded in a hotel room
Cuz ain't nothin' worse then flirtin' and teasin'
Trynna lift the skirt (I'm a virgin) I'm leavin'
You a virgin? You know you do this often
You're thing is so deep you can drown a school of dogs in
It's like every M.C., she done did it
Redman tapped, Lil' Weezy done hit it
Even them Boys from the Beastie done did it
Lil' Cease and R&B singers split it
Rumor has it from word of mouth
That ya thing's more dirtier than the dirty south
And I keep model chicks screamin' out, he a dog
Bust his ears hard, now she look like Nia Long
So, cute girls come jump in my ride
And all you buffalo gals go round the outside

I'm leavin', I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy, would always cheat and lie

She fell in love wit a star, the life, the car
The ""HUH, HUH, HAH!!""
Open like what wit a butt like Kim
When I seen it, it made me wanna nut right then
Yo, we got fly, we talked, she stopped bye
Lit the choc' lye, and passed it clockwise
Let me knock the boots, 'Til I was cock-eyed
And now she trynna act like she ain't got time
I told her, think of this before you try to be foul
There's ladies at the bar that could be buyin' me rounds
And all type models that be eyein' me down
I stay and you say good-bye to me now?
Fuck that, diss me, that's what's up here
You better get ya fat ass back up stairs
And if you try to creep, I'mma tie you in the basement
Catch ya little boyfriend and beat his little face in

I'm leavin', I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy, would always cheat and lie

Now all my sisters in the place
No matter what the race, we share a common cause
Everything be everything, get treated like a queen
'Til we give up the drawers
Now just when I thought, everything was cool
Let a brother even have a key
I said I let him use the car, then he took it too far
Brother out there cheatin' on me
Time to face the truth, when I really didn't want to
How the hell all these hoes keep gettin' my number?
Who was it? A distant cousin, came to see you
In prison, they said you already had a visit
Beefin' wit these strangers, how do you explain this?
Came this close to lettin' you put it in my anus
Wakin' up, middle of the night, brother out
Time to get the steppin', back to ya mother house, boy

Feel good see us takin off?
Doesn't it feel good to see us ball?
And they can't take it from us at all

Water, don't need none let it burn
Let it be known that it's my turn, let 'em turn
Be concerned with these words I got
Whatever they sayin about the Line, we better kill 'em
'Cause I got up and I got mine don't mean I'm trippin
Really left niggaz behind to handle business
They don't understand I'm in it to win it
Thug out with a crowd full of criminals and killers
So pump your fists if ya feel it, hear me
We in it to keep it the realest
With my remige, Thugline team, coming to kill something
Close to 30 million sold and still thuggin, still strugglin
Wassup with Bone? Gotta keep it real, so I tell them I don't know
Can't think no more excuses when niggaz don't show
We came up from poor, and I'm not going back to poor, no!

For The Love Of $, I keep it funky
Just thuggin back down in the ghetto
Sleep in the PJ's they let me so I love 'em back
By keepin it real, givin 'em shit that they can feel, like hustlin need more than a mil
Like how to make it on these streets and not be killed â??fore you get grown
Let a nigga go on 'cause he chose to live his life wrong
All I know is life is already short
And you can bring your non-exsistance closer if you want
Trust me, you don't nigga, live on, get'cha thug on (thug on)
Make you some cheese, get some weed and go get your buzz on
But must of all you gotta stay sucka-free, them bustas out ya mix
That go for anything you do and they go all to jail, I don't trip
I share a hater to the side, devil ass nigga
Always fuckin up my vibe, that's right now, nigga
You done meet Krayzie Bone, you ain't meet Leatherface
And I don't think you want to though, no!

'Cause it's about they bullshit they be talkin, why?
Niggaz in my business like they my bitches, got me hot (so hot, hot, hot, hot)
Run up, touch me, get burned, nigga
Said they saw me at the Source out on the floor, dropped (what?)  
Chickenhead bitch from Miami said we was runnin when the war popped
Hoe stop, you don't know none nigga rollin with me
What shut you puff? My niggaz hold on the be	
For most of them niggaz they want peace when we meet
Like we ain't be hearin what they be saying on the streets
So we gotta bring the heat
Speak if you want, but keep it to a mumble
Speak louder than a whisper, oh and we gonna get'cha

He's got them crying, 'cause they can't see,

The kind of girl who says her prayers at night,
He picks me up everyday from school,

And just before, my house appears,

Messages disrupt my day
Been sitting on my butt since Wednesday
Tried to hit you on your two way
Your mailbox was full

Whatever you like but first darling
Can we get our jig on get our swig on
Head back to my crib, before these niggas get it grown up in here
Please mind me for asking, have you ever had sex with a person with no attachments
In the heat of the moment
One night of passion
Nothing but a whole night of griding and grabbing
Moanin and groaning till six in the morning
By the time you rolling over yawning
You'll be hearing my car door slamming
And Perelli's balling, chrome chain, daddy for short
Honey sub for bartender, E & J on the rocks
Make it a double
By the way if I might say
Your looking quite ravishing in your Prada apparel
And shoes to the bags
Your lucky I don't rob your ass dear
Cut to the chase, gimme ya pin number

Could have sworn you held me

She spent so much time
Pursuin' you, knowing that you were blind
And that's a bummer, babe

So for you I did those things you were missing
Never have to say

Far from deprived

Like treacherous necklaces, beget etceteras

Spending bright futures in the hood
All them no good messages

Round 12 hit the highway stop, I need gas
Car behind me on my ass, speed pass
Turn the radio on that's my joint got me and I need to dance

Pull up in the truck and it ain't my man's
You screaming ""hey yo"", you don't got a chance
Son, you are speaking a language I don't understand
Know the dude I hang with, I don't hold his hand

Cause, me, I'm free to choose 
It's possible to leave with you
When we get through, I drive passenger seat for you
Let's ride

At one I arrive
Walked past the line
Damn his ass is fine 
Some guy now we up in the spot

Watch
Place hot 
Couple of bottles champagne popped
And that's how we doing it now

I'm scheming while the DJ's moving the crowd

I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home

It's around 2 A.M. 
The mood is trend 
The club is snug
I see him watching, love is love
Caught him when I looked up, gave him a glance
Promotion chick walked over while I'm shaking her hand
I'm looking over her
Sorry but I'm waiting for this man
Is what I told her, so she could leave
No breaking up my plans 
No time for talking about shows 
Or dates that I could host
Damn, he walking over to me, they breaking out the jokes
My girls laughing 
They see me already imagining
He whispered in my ear, would I dance with him 
I answered him
He took my hand with him 
Dancing close
I turned around and gave him my back, he passed a smoke
He put his hand on my hip, then my stomach 
He must want it 
And I was really just 'bout to leave, his clique fronted
Like they don't see 
That they man 'bout to tell 'em peace
And to think, I wasn't even gonna go out..see?

[Chorus]

All I need is my lip gloss, I.D., gum, and I'm straight
Especially if it's Envy in bungalow eight
We making it hot on the dance floor today
But my girls want to leave cause there's nothing to take
Nothing to meet 
Spot dead, nothing to see
Then we all agree that we won't leave
Cause some spots the papi's still come at three
That's when I tell the DJ to run that please
He dancing behind me 
I feel what's under his jeans
And I had one too many so I'm under his scheme
I mean I'm cool and the gang 
The music is playing
Think I found what I'm looking for, no purpose in waiting
Almost time for breakfast 
Standing by the coat checkers
Looking for my parking lot ticket, that's it
And this night just ended 
Can't say with who, what, or where but it'll definitely be remembered

Kelis,"The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in ""Set It Off""
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups, Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know When will they learn
Nas need a queen not a hoe to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ock
Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be cruisin'
But let's take, it, slow

Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we, suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got, we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby
I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that

Has kept me on my feet

You looked me in my face
And just the other day you brushed right by me
I felt you reeling in my space

No I won't let you trick me twice

Those days are old and overdone
And it's only cause I'm not with you that makes me number one
Though I may love you
I hurts me deep inside oh
Now you no longer have to hide

I used to be down with the late night hit
Started gettin' heavy when I really wasn't ready
Used my class to get in my mind
So I fell for your lies like all the time
I thought you were the shit to be playin' around
Call the police there's a mad girl in town
Couldn't get even here without a sound
It's not how I want to get down yeah you

Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice no
Might trick me once
I won't let you trick me twice
No I won't let you trick me twice
No I won't let you trick me twice

And I've paid all my dues for what I've done
And I showed you that I love you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Ooh trick me I won't let your trick me twice
You might trick me once
No I won't let me trick you twice no
You might trick me once
No I won't let me trick you twice

Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'

Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga
Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga

I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got

The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time

Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up

You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper
'Til you come across some ever more flyer paper
Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater

Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid

'Cause in reality I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact

Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggaz with raping
'Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars

So they counter the laws to take what's ours
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars

I got Kelis with me and the fire is growing up slow

Where there's fire there danger, don't wanna know where time
Sparks are flying between with me, exchanging blazes
So hurt somebodies bound together, I feel the heat
From my fire and there no return, I don't wanna, let's go
(Go, here we go, watch your flow, graises)

Go left, go right, go all day, let's not fight
Keep listening hold me up tight, don't let me go
It's early in the night, give it up now, hit it too good
Watch me close up, watch my body do good, don't move it
Babe, hold me right there, I'm a do my own thing over here
Play all night here I come

Well, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm comin' through
So hold steady feel the fire like the suns on you
Get it up, keep it up, dance with me all night long
No problem, you know, I got the flow
Come on, let's go I got Kelis with me
And the fire is growing up slow

Where there's fire there danger, don't wanna know where time
Sparks are flying between with me, exchanging blazes
So hurt somebodies bound together, I feel the heat
From my fire and there no return, I don't wanna, let's go
(Go, here we go, here we go, red square)

Danger, danger, let's all be aware, we be raisin' the roof on air
Feelin' excitment, it's in the air, Kelis be changin' the atmosphere
Look out ladies about next year, all our root boys

Kelis,"Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job, oh
Raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, oh
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Cause Bin Laden Wouldn't Be The Only One In The Scope
Get A Rope 
N Duck Tape there's Bout To Be A Crime
Simplify Yo Songs I ain't Simplifyin Mine
The Industry Done Got In The Streets that's Why Rappers Diein'
Don't Get It Confused Imma Still Show You How To Grind
They Tell Me If I Write A Lullaby For The Females
That These Sales Are Sure To Skyrocket In Retail
Hope You Got A Backup Plan If Yo Cd Fails
Ill Drown Em Like Seashells 
Till They Hit These Shells


[Chorus]
Everywhere That I Go (Everywhere I Go)
They Look At Me Like A Criminal
But I'm A Ceo, I'm A Ceo (Im A Self Employeed Ceo)
I Already Got Dough, I Already Got Dough(But I Think Its Time For Me To Get Mo')
I'm A Ceo, I'm A Ceo (Im A Self Employeed Ceo)

Bouncin On Rims Like A Brick At A Free Throw
I Told Em Tomorrow Imma Be On B.E.T 
Look At All The Free Clothin That They Came N Gave To Me
I Told Em Tomorrow Imma Be On M.T.V
Look At All The Jewelry My Jeweler Gave To Me Fo Free
I'm Winnin So Keep The Hatin To A Minimal
Ya'll Need To All Give Applause To The General
I'm Hearin How Ya'll Talk In Yo Interviews
Ya'll Really All Just Be Talkin Like A Interlude
Poppin At The Mouth
While I'm Poppin Tags
50 Thousand In My Pocket Pants Gotta Sag
Magazine Critics Always Talkin Like They Bad
But In The Streets Tryna Hide Behind A Pen N Pad
But Its Ok
I Know Why You Gettin Mad
'cause you know I Gotta Lot Of Whatever Yu Neva Had
Got A Betta Pad

We Gon Keep It Movin Try Ya Best To Get A Cab
Remember You Was Jammin Master P
Now That Houstons Super How You Try N Ask For Me
They Be Askin For A Verse don't Even Ask The Fee
Tellin Me How Many Bars To Spit Like that's For Free(Ehhh)

Unless Imma Sleep The Only Time Is Now Lets Grind
Y'all Need To Stop Like The Words On The Red Sign
Unless I'm Pointin Sumtin Tellin Ya Get Down

My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune, or a scale, I could play

The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea,
The silence was too deafening

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you,
My whole life was acapella

The only song to sing

One color was just like the others
An assembly routine
My memories were all black and white
Till I stopped over thinking
Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

You wave the white flag, but I want more
Back and forth, I want more, I want more

I think it's funny, you made me put down my pride
To tell the truth to you, I'll never lie
It's just so funny how things change after time
If it's with you, I'll smile the rest of my life

I'll make it worth it, too

E está magoada
Por coincidência eu também gostei
Da pessoa errada
De repente no final da noite
A gente acha um caminho
Estamos mesmo sozinhos

Se acaso isso acontecer
Não fique de bobeira e venha me encontrar

O dia em que todo dia era bom
Delicioso o gosto e o bom gosto das nuvens serem feitas de algodão 
Dava pra ser herói no mesmo dia em que escolhia ser vilão
E acabava tudo em lanche
Um banho quente e talvez um arranhão

Dava pra ver, a ingenuidade a inocência cantando no tom
Milhões de mundos e universos tão reais quanto a nossa imaginação
Bastava um colo, um carinho
E o remédio era beijo e proteção
Tudo voltava a ser novo no outro dia
Sem muita preocupação

É que a gente quer crescer
E quando cresce quer voltar do início
Porque um joelho ralado dói bem menos que um coração partido
É que a gente quer crescer
E quando cresce quer voltar do início
Porque um joelho ralado dói bem menos que um coração partido

Dá pra viver
Mesmo depois de descobrir que o mundo ficou mau
É só não permitir que a maldade do mundo te pareça normal
Pra não perder a magia de acreditar na felicidade real
E entender que ela mora no caminho e não no final

É que a gente quer crescer
E quando cresce quer voltar do início

In a downtown restaurant with a friend of a friend
She sure likes to talk and I ain't heard a single word she's said

Oh, but every now and then I nod
And I pretend to pay attention
And I say things like, ?Uh huh?
And, 'Yeah, you're right', and, 'Are you kiddin'?'
And I laugh when it seems
Like the right thing to do
It's hard to hold a conversation
Holdin' on to you

I'd give anything 
Just to hear your voice
Or see you look at me and smile
Oh but what I miss the most
Is holdin' onto you
'Cause here I am tonight
Staring at a woman
Who's the last thing on my mind

Oh, but every now and then I nod
And I pretend to pay attention
And I say things like, ?Uh huh?
And, 'Yeah, you're right', and, 'Are you kiddin''
And I laugh when it seems
Like the right thing to do
It's hard to hold a conversation

Make a chrysanthemum and kill them in their beds,
Make a chrysanthemum till everybody's dead

So get on your bike and ride to the junior high
Under the desk, head on your inner thigh

Does she laugh at your stupid jokes

That you always seem to leave behind

How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window while you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
What you feel when the voices that come from the window go
Until they distance and die, until there's nothing but sky

And how you're always turning back too late, from the grass
Or the stick or the dog or the light, how the kind of man
Who's willing to waits, not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night, dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying the face, stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way
Like a window but to see
It's the only way to see

And when the one man that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, ""Well, I'd give what I'd give""
But the one man who won't wait for you knows
That however you live, there's a part of you

Do you feel the kind of grace inside the breeze?
Will there be trees, is there light?

Does it shine from all around or just from you?

Is it endless and empty and you wander on your own?
Slowly forget about the folks that you have known
Water's rising, bread fill up the air
From moping kitchens everywhere
Familiar faces far as you can see, like a family

Do we live, is it like a little town?
Do we get to look back down at who we love?
Are we above, are we everywhere, are we anywhere at all?
Do we hear a trumpet call us and we're by your side?

Will I want or will I wish
For all the things that I should have done?
Longing to finish what I only just begun

Or has a shiny truth been waiting there
For all the questions everywhere

And you will always know

Smiling like the ways she does
And holding out her arms
And she calls my name
She will hold me just the same

Now I am, I am, I am past an audience I stare

Now it can't get me down
Slushy, humid and gritty
What a pretty town

What thought I could be duller
More depressing, less gay
Now my favorite color
Is gray

A wall of rain as it turns to sleep
The lack of sun on a one-way street
I love the grime all the time
And what more do I need?

My window pane has a lovely view
An inch of sky and a fly or two
Why I can see half a tree
And what more do I need?

The dusk is thick and it's galling
It simply can't be excused
In winter even the falling snow looks
Used

My window pane may not give much light
But I see you, so the view is bright
If I can love you, I'll pay the dirt no heed
With your love what more do I need?

Someone shouting for quiet
Someone starting a brawl
Down the block there's a riot
And I'll buy it all

Listen now, I'm ecstatic
Hold me close and be still
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill

A subway train thunders through the Bronx
A taxi horn on the corner honks
But I adore every roar
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs
A two ton child running wild upstairs
Steam pipes bang, sirens clang
And what more do I need?

The neighbors yell in the summer
The landlord yells in the fall
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall

An aeroplane roars across the bay
But I can hear you as clear as day
You said you loved me
Above the sound and speed

I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own

We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new

Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

It can shake your faith

Kellie Coffey,"Jenny was my best friend.
Went away one summer.
Came back with a secret 
She just couldn't keep.
A child inside her,
Was just too much for her
So she cried herself to sleep.

And she made a decision
Some find hard to accept.
To young to know that one day
She might live to regret.

But I would die for that.
Just to have one chance
To hold in my hands
All that she had.
I would die for that.

I've been given so much,
A husband that I love.
So why do I feel incomplete?
With every test and checkup
We're told not to give up.
He wonders if it's him.
And I wonder if it's me.

All I want is a family,
Like everyone else I see.
And I won't understand it
If it's not meant to be.

'Cause I would die for that.
Just to have one chance
To hold in my hands
All that they have.
I would die for that.

And I want to know what it's like
To bring a dream to life.
For that kind of love,
What I'd give up!
I would die for that.

Sometimes it's hard to conceive, 
With all that I've got,
And all I've achieved,
What I want most 
Before my time is gone,
Is to hear the words
""I love you, Mom.""

I would die for that. 
Just to have once chance
To hold in my hands
What so many have

Kellie Coffey,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my momma and me

And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs, he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again

When me an' my momma would disagree
To get my way, I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my momma said

Later that night while I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my momma cried for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more

""I know I'm praying for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dyin' to dance with my father again""

Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me

Night will whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be

Ripped my world apart

Standing in the front seat
Had my arm around his shoulder

There's sunny sky as far as I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

I think about how it ain't fair
That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do
You weren't around to cheer me on
Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do
Did you think I didn't need you here to hold my hand, to dry my tears?
Did you even miss me through the years at all?

She grew up ragged and she grew up rough

‘Cause I’m the only apple on the tree
That didn’t hit the ground
And sit down in the mud

And if I can stand up by myself
It’s ‘cause her gunpowder’s running through my blood

But never saw the woman I’ve seen
Never even touched a washing machine
And hung everything on the line

Kept the peaches and her money in a can and jar
Never owned a TV or drove a car
That stuff don’t make you what you are

For what seems like the millionth time.

And that is when I ask myself

How am I supposed to be
Everything they expect me to be
When I feel so alone,
'Cause I left my heart at home.
She needs me, but I know they need me too.
So God, give me the strength to do what you created me to do.

Really I'm so thankful for the people I meet,
The places I've been and the things I've seen,
But when she's not here
It doesn't feel like I'm living my dream.
I know they say that no one is perfect,
But I swear she's perfect for me

Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain

Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift so close your eyes and rest in peace

No tune, or a scale, I could play

The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea,
The silence was too deafening

So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat
It's just me surviving alone

Before you,
My whole life was acapella
Now a symphony's
The only song to sing
Before you,
My whole life was acapella

One color was just like the others

Decided to draw back the curtains
And I cleared all the cobwebs
And began to let in the light

When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a lovely cottage that, do you wanna meet Monday to pick up the forniture
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

Could you coo, there you go again, could you care, now wait a minute
For a lovely cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush
But I have got a crush, my baby, on you, oh yeah",Sing,2003
Kelly,"Il faudra que tu sois douce
Et solitaire aussi
Il te faudra gagner pouce à pouce
Les oublis de la vie

Puisque tu n'es pas née jolie

Il faudra que tu apprennes
À perdre, à encaisser
Tout ce que le sort ne t'a pas donné
Tu le prendras toi-même
Oh, rien ne sera jamais facile
Il y aura des moments maudits
Oui, mais chaque victoire ne sera que la tienne
Et toi seule en sauras le prix

And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no

Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree

Can never heal a heartached human soul

And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend

Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth

It was all meant to be
Would you believe me,
Would you agree
It's almost that feelin'
That we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come and now

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime,
For a moment like this
Some people search forever,
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime,
For a moment like this

Everything changes
But beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well I maybe dreamin'
But 'till I awake
Can we make this dream last forever
And I'll cherish all the love we share

I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall

To come in the night
And shine some sweet light on me
Found only strangers
Then you came to me
Just when I'd given up, you gave me love
My world was tumbling down
You turned it around baby

You, you're some kind of miracle
You are, you're a miracle to me

Sweet revelation
That look in your eyes
Your touch in the night
I find the sweetest salvation
In your arms baby
Warm as the morning sun, your tender love
Came and just lifted me up
Look what you've done baby

[Chorus]

You brought joy to my heart
I found love in your arms
See what you've done to me
You set my soul so free
You came and you gave me the love that I need

I hope you know
I love having you around me

Kelly Clarkson,"Love can be a many splendored thing
Can't deny the joy it brings
A dozen roses, diamond rings
Dreams for sale and fairy tales
It'll make you hear a symphony
And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool ya every time

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too
I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps callin'
And I keep on fallin'
Over and over again
The sad story always ends the same
Me standin' in the pourin' rain
It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie

Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me
So what's up lonely

Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side
Can't you find another shoulder, cause I
I want to leave this broken heart behind

Find someone else to rain on
I'm really getting' tired of singin' this sad song

But now who's the joke
And look who's laughing now

Now you're trying to use us
Against one another but it won't work 
I see right through your game boy
And I know exactly where the blame falls

You, you try to deny all your actions
For once in your life be a real man
At least give me the proper respect of the truth
I already know you did it

Why should I believe anything you say
And how could you treat me that way
Where'd you get the nerve to even think that you 
You could play me boy

Now I see right through you baby
You try to tell me you want me 
Can't you just get it through your thick head

Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
Sewn together, but so broken up inside
Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore

Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry 
Behind these hazel eyes

Can't deny the joy it brings

And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool ya every time

It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too

I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keep callin'

Mistaken, your sadness
Was hiding inside

Are the pieces to find
The mystery you kept
The soul behind a guise

This could break my heart or save me
Nothing's real
Until you let go completely
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me

Three months and I'm still sober
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers
But I know it's never really over

I don't know
I could crash and burn but maybe
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna get it right

And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

Want to feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Faraway
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Swinging 'round revolvin' doors
Maybe I don't know where they take me
But gotta keep movin' on
Movin' on
Fly away

I'll spread my wings, and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye

You couldn't win so you turn it around

You didn't let me down,
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes,
While breaking my heart
You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that I
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

Your love feels different it's like a blow to the head with your compliments.
Your love hurts deeper

From the words I said, felt like a new beginning
In my head, I see you standing there
The words you said felt like a story ending

We will never, ever be the same
Picture's changing, but not the frame
When I'm sleeping, I still kiss your face
I can't have it, when I'm awake

Even though we lost it, I still get nostalgic
Even if we wanted, we can't turn back the hands of time
Even though we lost it, I still get nostalgic

I dreamed a dream one day

Long the skies were overcast

Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Kelly Harland,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2008
Kelly Harrell,"I am a roving gambler, I've gambled down in town
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down
I had not been in Washington not many more weeks than three
When I fell in love with a pretty little gal, she fell in love with me
Fell in love with me, fell in love with me
She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in her mother's ear, ""I love that gambling man''
Love that gamblin' man, love that gamblin' man
""Daughter, oh dear daughter, how can you treat me so?
To leave your dear old mother, and with a gambler go?''
With a gambler go, with a gambler go
I've gambled down in Washington; I've gambled over in Spain
I'm goin' down to Georgia to gamble my last game
Gamble my last game, gamble my last game
""Oh mother, oh dear mother, you know I love you well
But the love I have for this gambling man, no human tongue can tell''
No human tongue can tell, no human tongue can tell
""I hear that train a-coming, coming 'round the curve
A-whistling and a-blowing straining every nerve""
Strainin' every nerve, strainin' every nerve
""Mother, oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see me comin' back, I'll be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man""

Kelly Hogan,"Walking slow to the graveyard I've lost everything I could lose
Now I've even lost my baby I guess I've got the drunkard's blues
It was down at Big Joe's barroom on the corner beyond the square
Everybody drinkin' good liquor the regular crowd was there
So I strolled out on the sidewalk began to look around
Looking everywhere for my baby but that sweet woman can't be found
It was down at St James infirmary I found my baby there
Stretched out on a long white table so cold so pale so fair
So I strolled back down to the barroom to get another drink of gin
The next thing you know I'm reeling rocking and drunk again
Sixteen coal black horses all hitched up in a line
In that pretty buggy she's ridin' goodbye ol' gal of mine
Walking slow to the graveyard I've lost everything I could lose
Now I've even lost my baby I guess I've got the drunker's blues

Kelly Joe Phelps,"Tommy had a watch, a good kind of watch
It wouldn't tell time if you asked it
Didn't have a face, just an ear and an eye
To see him with

Tommy stole candy from the corner store
And gave it to the mice he built a home for
By the side of the heater, next to his guitar
That he could neither play nor destroy

Tommy wrote a letter to the office of iniquity
Demanding a history of his actions
But the letter was returned just 2 days gone

Tommy couldn't see so well and he didn't have a radio
He'd talk to himself in different voices
Or sing to himself in a Russian dialect
Invented on a Sunday afternoon

Tommy stole a limp and he borrowed a demeanor
So he'd scare anybody who'd want to talk away
'Cause they frightened him so bad that he'd pee down his legs
As he tried, very hard, to find the words

Tommy wore the helmet of a frustrated miner
Digging for words as though gold
Standing in the mud in his dark gray fedora
Wearing his knee-patched dungarees

Tommy was alone when the fire started
High behind the wheel of a colt 45
With a clip full of ether and a bucket full of gas
And a belly full of turpentine

Tommy made sure there was no one in danger
By knocking on each door like a madman
Then he locked himself in and did the whirling dervish
Tipped the candle over on the floor

Tommy fell asleep before the firemen came
Which was good because they scared him anyway
All that they found were the mice inside the fridge
In a box, with some cheese
And a hand warmer, run on batteries

No shirt no pants, the hold hang bird is skinned
Floating in a cooking pot.

You people come and follow me.
If you follow and love, You'll learn the mystery
Of what you were meant to do and be.


1. When the song of the angels is stilled.
When the star in the sky is gone.
When the kings and the shepherds have found their way home.
The work of Christmas is begun!


2. To find the lost and lonely one,
To heal that broken soul with love,
To feed the hungry children with warmth and good food,
To feel the earth below the sky above!


3. To free the prisoner from his chains,
To make the powerful care,
To rebuild the nations with strength and goodwill,
To call a man your brother everywhere.


4. To bring hope to every task you do,
To dance at a baby's new birth,
To make music in an old man's heart,
And sing to the colors of the earth!

Only me and you

A secret rendezvous
After midnight
They tried to keep us from each other
They crucified our love

Said we were not good enough
To be lovers
I want to hold you in the morning
(I want to hold you)

I want to wake up by your side
Give no reason to hide
From the feeling
(Give me a feeling)

I want to tell the world about it
Tell them all the truth
Get up on the roof
Stop and shout it

Our love will last forever
True love
True love never dies
We'll always be together

True love
Our love will last forever
True love
True love never dies

We'll always be together
True love
True love never dies
True love never dies
True love never dies
True love never dies

The moonlight shadows in the streetlight
Only me and you
A secret rendezvous
After midnight

They tried to keep us from each other
They crucified our love
Said we were not good enough
To be lovers

Our love will last forever
True love
True love never dies
We'll always be together

True love
Our love will last forever
True love
True love never dies

We'll always be together
True love
Our love will last forever
True love

True love never dies
We'll always be together
