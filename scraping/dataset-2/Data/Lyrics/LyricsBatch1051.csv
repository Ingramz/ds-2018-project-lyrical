Steve Vai,"Ti porto dove c'è musica
Saremo tutti di noi
E il mondo per una volta farai
Girare come tu vuoi

Qualcuno ha detto la musica è fratellanza
Buona speranza allora
Buona speranza

Se c'è un silenzio da rompere
E un muro d'ostilità
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Qualcosa succederà

Prendi questa libertà
Che ti porta dove va

Via
Dove c'è musica c'è ancora prateria
Oh, via
A fare correre un po' i brividi
E poi nell'anima
Giù in fondo all'anima
Dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò
Io ci sarò

Hanno buttato giù l'Odeon
E ci faranno un discount
Un altro sogno che uccidono
Un'altra volgarità

Qualcuno ha detto è il segno che cambia il tempo
Qualcuno che non ci sta
A cambiare dentro

Prendi questa libertà
Che ti porta dove va

Via
Dove c'è musica c'è ancora fantasia
Oh, via
Coi nostri piedi sulle nuvole
E poi nell'anima
Fino in fondo all'anima
Dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò

E poi nell'anima
Dritto in fondo all'anima
Dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò

Ti porto dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò
Saremo tutti di noi
Io ci sarò
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Dove c'è musica
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Fino in fondo all'anima
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò
Ti porto dove c'è musica
Io ci sarò",Dove C'E' Musica,2008
Steve Vai,"Walking down the street
You're the center of my universe
You got the world in your pocket,
My manhood in your purse
You ain't a bad girl, honey,
No matter what the neighbors say,
It's just that you were those skin-tight dresses
With your G-string tuned to ""A"" 

Sweet, sweet, child of the street 

Heaven sent, you're an angel dressed in black,
Cool, stiletto strut, you're a drop jaw cardiac
You're the genuine, feline, prettiest girl I've ever seen,
With your thief of hearts smile
You're a certified pleasure machine 

Sweet, sweet, child of the street 

Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur,
You get what you want
With your pussy cat purr 

But, the kittens got claws,
She'll tear your heart out
The kittens got claws,
She'll scratch your back
The kittens got claws
She'll tease an' please you
The kittens got claws,
She's a heart attack 

You treat me good,
Sometimes you treat me bad,
But, keep it up, honey,
You're the best time I've ever had
No matter what you put me through I must confess,
Oh, you got more style than a brand new XJS 

Sweet, sweet, child of the street 

Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur,
You get what you want

Steve Vai,"Lets take a plane and go somewhere exotic
To play with a non-descript song
We'll shoot all the crotch shots for 12 year old hopefuls
To make you a real man my son

That pours like the darkest brown ale
Just one more puppet, piss elegant marionette
He's just a fast buck for sale

We know that God blessed video

And get someone to carve up my hair

And be glad to say you were there",God Blessed Video,2017
Steve Vai,"Just one more of those 82 nights
We were all cowboys ready to ride
Fire the gun, turn your eyes to the sea
Through that night, riding your trigger with me.

Your local station gives out the news
""The sky is burning, in Malibu""

As the beach turns an ominous green
Bathed in light from the shape in the sky
We all tanned, in a new kind of sun
Something's wrong and we're getting ready to run

Your local station knows what to say
It's just a fuel burn so its o.k.
Please hold the phone calls there's no more news
It's just a skyfire in Malibu.

Pros to cons from diplomats-liars
Words designed to tranquilize-fighters

The sky is burning in Malibu

It's just a skyfire, skyfire burning in Malibu.",Skyfire,2017
Steve Vaughan,"Day by day, night after night
Blinded by the neon lights
Hurry here, hustlin' there
No one's got the time to spare
Money's tight, nothin' free
Won't somebody come and rescue me
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
Stranded, caught in the crossfire

Tooth for tooth, eye for an eye
Sell your soul just to buy buy buy
Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime
Come on can't you see that I
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

I need some kind of kindness
Some kind of sympathy oh no
We're stranded, caught in the crossfire

Save the strong, lose the weak
Never turning the other cheek
Trust nobody, don't be no fool
Whatever happened to the golden rule

Steve Veale,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Steve Veilleux,"Je sais pas ça part de où
Depuis quand
J’ai la phobie de toutes les peurs
Même celle de ne plus en avoir
J’ai beau briser mes habitudes
Les mauvaises
J’ai beau m’ouvrir l’esprit en quatre c’est toujours pareil j’angoisse

Je ne chasse plus l’inévitable
Je fais avec
Défaitiste et paranoïaque
Je fais avec 

J’ai dans la tête une boîte à mal
Je suis mon propre psycho trackeur
La fin du monde c’est l’hôpital
Je n’ai plus le temps de vivre je meurs

Je carbure aux mélodrames
Je m’y saoule
Hypocondrie permanente
Le verdict sera sans appel
J’attends toujours ma rédemption 
Temporaire

De tous ces maux imaginaires

Steve Veilleux,"Travailler comme un chien toute ta vie durant
La fonderie, la coulée, les poussières d’années
Envolées à coup d’usure, d’eau de vie dure…
Vieille école, huile de bras, le pain noir avant le blanc
Fin de semaine, plutôt terne, pas un jour plus haut que l’autre
Tu n’as même jamais pris le temps de faire semblant
Jamais de merci facile, tout se mérite dans la vie
Tu disais aussi que la pluie nettoie les menteries
De ceux qui n’ont jamais eu le courage
De gagner leur vie…

Demain tout recommence ground zero commandant
Il n’est jamais trop tard pour s’offrir une tournée de bon temps…

Je sais je n’ai pas appelé assez souvent
Ni avant de débarquer un soir de semaine, ridé
J’avais seulement envie de t’entendre me raconter
Que dans ton temps le ciel était plus bleu qu’aujourd’hui
Que le bonhomme 7 heures faisait sa ronde à minuit
Que tout le monde se tenait pour le meilleur, pour le pire

Steve Veilleux,"C’est un soir de salon, de couverte de laine
Dehors la vie a l’air sur pause
Froid mais serein… l’hiver

J’ai juste envie de faire le mort 
Entre plancher et plafond
Pendant que tout le monde veut changer le monde
Moi je m’enfonce

C’est peut-être que je crains l’eau chaude
Trop échaudé je suppose
Ou que j’ai un coeur de tôle
Rouillé de tout ce que je m’impose
Mais pour l’instant je m’échappe
Et en contrôle je dérape

Je me sens déjà vu
Prévisible comme un film plate
J’aurais envie de sortir prendre l’air
Mais janvier prend toute la place

Je n’ai pas envie de voir la fin
Ni de laver mon linge sale
Je voudrais seulement que pour une heure il ne se passe rien
60 minutes banales

Sans intro-fiction

Au milieu de l’océan

Au moment où j’allais en sortir

Un soleil dans la nuit
Un miracle un mirage
Encore plus beau qu’une légende
Pur comme la première neige

Me réchauffent l’existence
Tu seras mon nirvana ma fontaine de jouvence

Sans vagues ni étincelles

Je t’apprendrai à te défendre
Devant l’indécence
Devant l’infortune des jours sombres
J’allumerai les lumières
Nous serons ensemble de grands hommes
Poètes ou magiciens 
Soudés coude-à-coude nous serons bons vivants

I don't want to be dismal.
But I don't want to rot in an apathetic existence either.
See I want to believe you,
And I want to trust
And I want to have faith to put away the dagger. 
But you lie, cheat, and steal.
And yet I tolerate you.
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method 
While I smile and laugh and dance
And sing your praise and glory.
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance

How can I tolerate you.

I've been far too sympathetic.
Our blood, our fault.

Rest your trigger on my finger,
Bang my head upon the fault line.
Take care not to make me enter.
Cause if I do we both may disappear.
But you're pushing me,
Shoving me. Pushit on me.
Slipping back into the gap again.
I'm alive when you're touching me,
Alive when you're shoving me down.
But I'd trade it all
For just a little bit of
Piece of mind.
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be.
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see.
Never wanna see that place again.
Saw that gap again today
As you were begging me to stay.
Managed to push myself away,
And you, as well.
If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

Steve Wallace,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2001
Steve Walsh,"Well they called the flat plains Kansas a long, long time ago
When they'd seen the gates of glory and the fire down below
The many great decisions of the people in this place 
You could tell the strength within them, you could see it their face

Well it's been 9 or 10 years since I started my ramblin' round
And from hand to mouth I was livin' playing every bar in town
Though a dollar a day didn't go too far I could never deny my pride
I couldn't lay back and be taken care of while the world went by outside 

So I went to school to learn but I didn't like what they'd teach
And I went to church to pray but I didn't like what they'd preach 
I was hard-headed, young and angry, and I felt I could take the heat 
And I had to find out my own way how to live out on the street 

So I packed my bags and I left here to peruse the streets alone 
And I saw that side of midnight where the beggars howl and groan 
Places filled with desperation where the future ain't so bright 
But I remember back in Kansas when we sang a song at night 

We sang every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you

Goin'  around and round from town to town I tried to make my way 
I believed that all my searching and struggling would payoff bug some day 
As a teenager I was rowdy and I played for good and bad
Though I knew my songs had meaning at times it made me mad

And I'd fight the wars of nations if it brought somebody peace
Yes I'd fight the wars of madmen if I knew the fight would cease
But this ol' world never stopped turning when my mind was full of doubt
So I went on and played for a dollar a day and I sang  this song straight out 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah , for you
When they call out your name say it loud and clear 
Come on, come on 

You must have seen me traveling' around you must have seen me there
Tryin' to find out where I was heading you could have tossed to care 
Well, I had all the questions, I wanted the answers 
I knew in my heart it was all part of the game 
But every step was so much harder,  every step of the way 
I knew that time would beat me someday 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah, for you",Every Step of the Way,1980
Steve Walters,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity

So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.",Lady Be Good,2008
Steve Wariner,"There have been some times
I thought it was forever
Only to watch love disappear before my eyes
Have no one to hold at night

Well, I'm right back where I started
Just trying to make it better
Guess I'll just give love another try

I can't seem to stop
Starting all over again
And I wonder what it would take
For me to ever win

Till I finally find myself
A lover and a friend
I ain't never gonna stop
Starting over again

Three words, 'I Love You'
Are so easy to say
It's so hard to prove it
Night after night, day after day

Feelings starts to fade
When the new wears away
I won't ever give up
Till I find a love that stays

I can't seem to stop
Starting all over again
And I wonder what it would take
For me to ever win

Steve Wariner,"Cold city like the eyes in the subway station
It's ten stories to my desk in the smoggy sky
But after five, I'm headed home to heaven
To an easy world
There ain't nothin' like the love of a small town girl
Hot coffee and the sound of her sweet voice callin
Country station on the kitchen radio
That's how I know
There's still a little magic
In this crazy world...
There ain't nothin' like the love of a small town girl
She makes love to me in real close two part harmony
She makes the city feel like walks in the cool country rain
No traffic and the sound of the street is quiet
Fifth avenue is dressed in a foot of snow
No where to go but underneath the covers
Lovers while the snowflakes swirl
There ain't nothin' like the love of a small town girl
There ain't nothin' like the love of a small town girl",Small Town Girl,1987
Steve Wariner,"All my friends say, I should leave you alone.
You've got a heart like a stone, And a wonderin' eye.
And I know that they're right.
I can make up my mind, Not to see you again,
But you move through my dreams like the wind,
It's no good to pretend, It won't happen again,
Cause it'll happen again.

And your gonna get burned.

And baby I tried, But I'm just not that strong,
Yes, I knew all along, But that's not enough

And you don't know it, But I came over tonight,
There was somebody's car parked outside.
Damn my eyes, Damn this heart of mine.
I drove off into the night.

And your gonna get burned.
It's only love when your loved in return.

Somewhere in the city tonight,
There's a girl and she's lonely like me,
She'll be easy to see.
And naturally, She'll have that look in her eyes,
She'll be feeling that way.
I see it all plain as day.
Oh, I'll never be, what she wants me to be
Oh, but lucky for me

The grass is always greener
We want what we can't have
Or so it seems

When I looked at you
The world never looked any sweeter
I go home to her
And see you in my dreams

So if you want someone
To fill your waking hours
With a love that is real
Baby I'm still not free
If you think you could fall
For a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin' of someone
You can dream of me

When the stars are out
Sometimes I still can remember
The clear September night
When we first met

And through the fall
I never looked at another
Then the winter came
How quickly we forget

So if you want someone
To fill your waking hours
With a love that is real
Baby I'm still not free
If you think you could fall
For a telephone call
And some flowers
If you're dreamin of someone
You can dream of me

Dream of me
I'll be dreamin of you
I'll never forget how you told me
That your heart was taken too

You said
So if you want someone
To fill your waking hours
With a love that is real
Baby I'm still not free

Like the softest of a  midnight walk thru moonbeams

So many reasons I can't live without you
How can the moon tell the stars when to shine

They already  glimmer  the night
They're shining much brighter
With your heart close to mine 
That's how you know love's right

It always comes from the place you don't expect it
No one ever set my heart on fire like you did
And all my life I never knew what love could bring me
Until it happened to you and me that moment

He could always count on mama to supply
And regardless of the sleep she might be losin'
He always found a twinkle in her eye

And heaven help us always to remember
That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world

She taught him all the attributes of greatness
That she knew he couldn't learn away from home
And by the time she wore the cover off her bible
Her hair was gray and her little man was gone

Maybe tinsel town's for me

For a reason to make living worthwhile
I found that reason

And there for awhile
All of my dreams came true
There for awhile
There was nothing I couldn't do
Yes, there for awhile

There for awhile, you were here

Afraid of what the answer might be
Would you love me forever

Just how soon you'd be going away
Would it have made a difference

Daddy said those city girls will walk all over you

In this fancy foreign car
Headed for another party 
Never seen so many stars
Just when I thought I'd make my move 
And ask her to be mine
She takes off with somebody else 

And kisses me goodbye
She was incredible, she was

Well she was way too hard to handle 
For a country boy like me

I can't help if I still love you

And the willow tree it knows when to bend
Even a fool knows when to go with the flow

And it tears me up inside
To really think that it's all over
And I still can't say goodbye

Steve Wariner,"There's a suitcase, and a heartache,
She was thinkin' of leavin'
But she unpacks, and she goes back, to him.

So he gets by, with a bad lie,
Cause in her mind, it's the last time,
And she needs him, so she believes him, again.

A woman loves beyond her questions,
And dreams beyond her doubts,
Her heart will lead and she will follow,
Even when there's no way out.
Her eyes refuse to see the danger,
As she walks right through the fire.
A man may give himself to passion and desire.
But a woman loves.

In the morning, lyin' next to him,
She'll be weepin', while he's sleepin',
Goin' crazy, thinkin' maybe, it's her fault.

Maybe one night, In the moonlight,
She'll touch his hand, and he'll understand,
How it could be, How it should be, after all.

A woman loves beyond her questions,
And dreams beyond her doubts,
Her heart will lead and she will follow,

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over I didn't think twice
I found got something worth keeping
And if I can't have you tonight,
At least I had the weekend
The radio plays the sound of the waves rolling in
The smell of the night sure can get under your skin
Just for a moment, I held you too close
Now I'm all out of time and I don't want to let go

I guess its all depending on your point of view

Steve Wariner,"'Tis the day, the blessed day, on which our Lord was born,

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Now hearthe salutation

In a humble feeding trough, within a lowly shed,
With cattle at His Infant feet, and shepherds at His head,
The Savior of this sinful world, in innocence first lay,
And wise men made their off'ring, upon a holy day. 

[Chorus]

He will save the perishing, will waft the sighs to heav'n.
Of guilty men, who truly seek, and weep to be forgiv'n
And Intercessor still He shines, and men to Him should pray,
Before His alter meekly, upon this holy day.

It's the same old situation it happens every time

That I loved you

What would you think
What would we do

Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end

I can read between the lines of what your telling me
And he doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held

Oh we've both had our share of loneliness
So who's to say we can't have a little happiness
And if I found that in you
It would make my dreams come true
Or would you walk away
Hear what I have to say

[Chorus:]
Every little whisper, every little sigh
Every time I hold her I think I'm gonna die
Every time her heart beats I know that I'm alive
With ever little whisper, every little sigh

There's this thing that she does and she don't even know
I don't say a word, man I just let her go
There's a smile that she saves when she lets her hair down
Deep in the night there is only one sound",Every Little Whisper,1998
Steve Wariner,"One day shy of eight years old,
When grandma passed away.
I was a broken hearted little boy,
Blowing out that birthday cake.
How I cried when the sky let go,
With a cold lonesome rain.
My mom smiled, said: ""Don't be sad child.
""Grandma's watching you today.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Seasons come and seasons go,
Nothing stays the same.
I grew up, fell in love,
Met a girl who took my name.
Year by year, we made a life,
In this sleepy little town.
I thought we'd grow old together,
Lord, I sure do miss her now.

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Well my little girl is 23,
I walk her down the aisle.
It's a shame her Mom can't be here now,
To see her lovely smile.
They throw the rice, I catch her eye,
As the rain starts coming down.
She takes my hand; says: ""Daddy don't be sad,
'cause I know Mama's watching now.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.

""And she's watching over you and me.""

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.",Holes in the Floor of Heaven,1998
Steve Wariner,"She brought some perfume from Paris
And I bought some brand new cologne
She made a candlelight dinner and I put some soft music on
We sat by the fire waiting for desire
To lift us up and take us far away
But she started getting sleepy
I turned on the tv
One more night of love just went to waste

[Chorus:]
Well it's broke and I don't know how to fix it
There's not a day goes by that I don't miss it
Yeah, love jumped the track and we just can't get it back
I still love that woman so
But it's broke and I don't know how to fix it

She said a change of scenery
Might just be the very thing we need
I said, ""What about Las Vegas?""
She said, ""What about Miami Beach?""
We ended up in Denver
But I never did convince her
That we'd reached the perfect compromise
She said, "" I hate cold weather""
I said, ""But we're together"" 
And she said, ""Yeah that's where the problem lies""

You held on to me heart and soul

Slip into something nice and soft
And lie here in my arms

Love me like you love me
Do it like you mean it one more time tonight
Hold me close and love me like you love me

Take all your dreams and shattered hopes
Every angry word we ever spoke
And trade 'em for a couple cherry cokes
Lay here for a while

There are no questions that we need to ask
Every precious kiss could be our last
There is no future and there is no past

And smoke disappears in the wind
It's just smoke from an old flame

And, girl, then he'll burn you again

From leaving if you want to go
It hurts me but, girl, I'll release you

I say all the perfect words in the candle glow
This time I'm not the fool who lets you go

Every night I go dream walking
About the time the walls start talking
Everything around me calls your name
I go dream walking since you walked away

Every night I make believe you're here with me
But every day the sunrise finds me
Down on my knees still wanting you
Why tell me why can't this dream come true

Every night I go dream walking
About the time the walls start talking
Everything around me calls your name
I go dream walking
I go dream walking
I go dream walking since you walked away",Since You Walked Away,1999

This close to her heart
The right word the right time

Did you ever want to kiss somebody

Let me tell you what I've learned about girls
In this age of high tech and state of the art
When it comes to love you've still gotta talk to her heart

She can have a college degree
MBA or a Ph.D.
She can be strong and she can be smart
But when it comes to love, you've still got to talk to her heart

You got to be honest you got to be real
You got to tell her how you really do feel
Don't talk about fishin' don't talk about cars
Talk about the moon and talk about the stars
Tell her she's beautiful just talk to her heart

Steve Wariner,"When you've hitched every highway
And rode all the rails
You're no longer afraid of the dark
You get tougher than leather and harder than nails
When you've earned all the scars on your heart

Hobos and heroes, bankers and bums
In some ways we're all the same
We all have to pay for the deeds that we've done
And wind up just dragging those chains

Life paints a picture that time can't erase
And sometimes it cuts like a knife
Sooner or later one way or another
We all wear the tattoos of life

The glory in living
Is just running the race
Not whether you win or you fail
The lines like a road map
Will show on your face
And your eyes tell the rest of the tale

Before you fall
You say love's definition is not

Well I can understand why you're afraid
And just so we're both on the same page
Let me try and make this whole thing clear

[Chorus:]
I'm talkin' pure devotion
A won't-be-denied emotion
Deeper than the ocean
Well that's love for you
It's unexplainable uncontainable irreplaceable
Well you know that it's true
That's love for you

You'll see my interpretation of love
Is right on the mark
If you'll give me half a chance
And follow your heart
Forever's what I've got in mind
So let me say this one more time
And make it as simple as I can

Steve Wariner,"Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain

Lead you to someone who cares

Well, Jimmy Stewart's on my screen again
Man I miss those simple black and white days
Then someone hits the remote and I see the sad dark eyes
Of a young girl on the other side of the world
And I think about the things she's had to see
Things my children can't even imagine

[Chorus]

So whoever you are know that God's shining star
Always leads you to someone who cares",This Christmas Prayer,2003
Steve Wariner,"All my frien's are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms

We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow

I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me

We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow

I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms",Christmas in Your Arms,2004
Steve Wariner,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go blind for you
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

Storms are raging on a rolling sea
Down the highway of regret
Winds of change are blowing wild and free, yeah huh
But you ain't seen nothing like me yet

There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my love",To Make You Feel My Love,2007
Steve Wariner,"Like a boat on a river this bus is floating down this old highway
Looking out the window I think about how I got here today
Anyone who's anywhere had some help getting there its true
And one of the reasons why I get to do the things I do

I met this angel
With callused hands
Who led this boy to his band
Under his wing I learned to fly
On these six strings through this life
You can hear them in my playing
Although he's gone
And I owe him so much more than just this song

Like a leaf that had fallen I was drifting down the stream
Mr. Guitar came into my life and let me live this dream
His old Gretch still speaking still speaking its teaching all of us a ton
He was my friend and my hero all wrapped up in one

I met this angel
With callused hands
Who lead this naive boy into his band
Under his wing I learned to fly
On his six strings into the night
I can still hear him playing although he's gone
And I owe him so much more than just this song

Every face we see from we every stage we roll
With every note we play even though there gone
They live on
They live on",More Than Just This Song,2008

They see that I'm a star, now they want to sit in my car
Now they want to count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They telling all they friends when I leave how they miss me now

Because they see me paid, pimping pens, working my jelly
And I ain't tripping cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, living laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
They know that I got it made, I'm a motherfucking baller
She would want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she trying to call me

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def

All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means

I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would

I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying
I thought that I was over you but it's true so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling, what can I do for you?
No, don't love me and I'll always be

Yes, now you're gone but from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, oh crying, crying
Yeah crying, crying over you",Crying,2007

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Makes a note of what's a float
And spinning 'round he'll cut your throat

In the time it takes to heal
The dealer's made another deal
When he plays he plays for keeps
And sweeps the spinning roulette wheel

Dealer, Dealer
Like the mighty ocean's roar
He gets all his share and more
Mexican right to the core and very proud

He'll get even with the score
Leave your wife a weeping widow on the shore
Between the desert and the dove
Money is his only love

Feeling nothing deep inside
His mind is governed by his pride
In a smoky little room
Shadows moving in the gloom

Someone turns a running flush
And breaks the deathly quiet hush
Dealer, Dealer",Dealer,1971
Steve Winwood,"Forty thousand headmen couldn't make me change my mind
If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far, when suddenly I saw
Three small ships are sailing out towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette, I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave, where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn, had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds, I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him, who he was, he said, ""Just look behind""

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen hit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

Heading down the road, forty thousand headmen
Going around the lane, going around the lane, around, around the lane
Forty thousand headmen on my trail, oh",Forty Thousand Headmen,1971
Steve Winwood,"Like a hurricane around your heart when earth and sky are torn apart
He comes gathering up the bits while hoping that the puzzle fits
He leaves you, he leaves you
Freedom rider

With a silver star between his eyes that open up at hidden lies
Big man crying with defeat, see people gathering in the street
You feel him, you feel him
Freedom rider

When lightning strikes you to the bone, you turn around, you're all alone
By the time you hear that silent (or siren?) sound, then your soul is in the lost and found
Forever, forever
Freedom rider
Here it comes",Freedom Rider,1971

I'm gonna go away from here

Pulled the blind and closed the door
She said, ""now, goodbye stevie,
I don't need you no more.""

She's gone, I mean it here today
Leavin's so much work cause I know I'm going away

Well I'm leaving

Can turn a man into a shadow, crying out from pain?

Through his nightmare vision, he sees nothing, only well

His hands are torn and bloodied from the scratching at his soul

You can learn how to play
Born like you were in a terrible mess, didn't know what it was to have a new dress

So fresh on the scene

They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited.
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heaven's generosity.
Peeping round the door
To see what parcels are for free
In curiosity.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is.
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends
He sits so silently
And unaware of everything.
Playing poxy pinball,
Picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything.
I believe in love
But how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened.
Only if he's cured
Will his spirits future level ever heighten.

Steve Winwood,"You hold your broken heart out
And you say it just won't stop hurting
Like there's something I can do

The rule is so plain
Party girl play like it's laying
Pack it up-hear what I'm saying
The party's over-better walk away

Turn the page-look, and listen
Somewhere music plays
Planes leave every day
Big girls walk away

You want to play with princes
On a million dollar holiday
But you never met their mothers

You just go so high
Party girl just keep the earrings
Nothing else is worth a damned thing
Just save the party for another day

You know this old world is wide
And you're to catch another ride
You just go till you come out the other side",Big Girls Walk Away,1982
Steve Winwood,"We had the stars-they kept shining
Where they led us we followed
Two for love-wandering
I look back-here's what I see
We were outside-there was Paris it was raining
And we felt everything
In a crowded street in London happiness
And we were so alive
And your soul was a wide and deep blue sea
I would drown, and you'd rescue me
And we lived our life like a story
Clear to the ending

It was happiness-so clear-happiness
Happiness-no tears-happiness

Can't keep time from its running
Soon the best times are over
Photographs-hold me
And I see how good we were
There was that day out in caramel, California
With no clothes in the sun
In a crowded street in London-happiness
And then it all goes by
So I drink to the past and what still will be

One day I'll be a memory
But I lived my life like a story
Too bad there's an ending",It Was Happiness,1982
Steve Winwood,"Here's to gamblers
Who hold to the game
Through the hard times
They don't lose their aim
And they hope for time on their side
And they keep a ticket to ride

They keep watching for signs in the land
They keep watching for signs in the land
And they stand there watching the sky
And they stand there ready to fly

Here's to never letting go
Though sometimes it does get lonely

I still walk out in the morning light
Just to see what is there
I hear music in silent nights
Searching I find a reason to care
One heart moving still the same
Still in the game

Here's to lovers who reach for it all
Never matching the rise with the fall
And they just can't leave it alone
And they want it all till it's gone
Here's to players who can't leave their song
And it haunts them
Their night is so long
Cause there's music there in their mind
From a world they're trying to find

Here's to never letting go
Though sometimes it does get lonely",Still in the Game,1982
Steve Winwood,"There's a river pouring
From a pure and a crystal stream
And it carries my heart along
Carries me all my life
And I know it will bring me home

There's a choir singing
With a force that can light the sky
I will join with a voice deep inside
Anthems for joys gone by
And for joys I am sure will come

Golden treasure in the evening sky
It's good to be alive
Golden measure, hear the music cry
When my heart sings
Of golden things

There's a dove ascending
Like my thoughts in the summer sky
And she carries my soul along
Clear to eternity
And I know I am not alone",There's a River,1982
Steve Winwood,"You used to come and see me all the time
I gave you everything I had
I brought you up
And I never left you one time feeling bad
They say it's a new age
And I wonder where you've been
You can help me turn a new page
The same door is open-come on in

While there's a candle burning
I'll be reaching for your heart
While there's a wheel still turning
I know how to play my part
So I keep the wheels all turning
And I keep the candles burning
All day through here for you

The world is full of players in the night
They say the words they have to say
They're all so hot
And they never give a damn for yesterday
Don't care if they touch you
Everywhere you saved for me
'Cause I still know how to move you
I still know how to rock you-come and see",While There's a Candle Burning,1982
Steve Winwood,"While there is time
Let's go out and feel everything
If you hold me
I will let you into my dreams
For time is a river rolling into nowhere
We must live while we can
And we'll drink our cup of laughter

The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

I've been sad
And have walked bitter streets alone
And come morning
There's a good wind to blow me home
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
I will live while I can
I will have my ever after

The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

We go so fast, why don't we make it last
Life is glowing inside you and me
Please take my hand, right here where I stand
Won't you come out and dance with me, oh
Come see

And lovers try
'Til they get the best of the night
And come morning
They are tangled up in the light
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
And they love while they can
And they think about the night so sweet

Steve Winwood,"The story goes, the truth is no one knows
A stranger came
A man who lost his name
At night he tells his tale
Prison, women, wail
They took him in, he let them win
Over and over

He said if you don't have good words to say

Down through the years

Give me life where nothing fails
Not a dream in a wishing well

A man in tattered clothes, crying all he knows
The darkness grows, that's how it goes
Over and over

He said I think of the beauty I've had
And all it does is make me feel so bad
First they make you think you're riding high
Then they toss you off in the sky
And all this life is just falling
Down through the years
And oh, I'd rather sleep

Nothing was happening, I was ready to go
Then I saw her walking through that door
And I knew right then I had to get me some more

Moved up close, up next to the bar
There she sat, lookin' like a movie star
Went up and asked her, 'Do you mind if I sit?'
She said, 'No, but if you see a chance, you'd better take it.'
Just the two of us sat talking together
The music and people all drifting away

Hearts on fire, burning with love
We were written in the stars above
Take us higher to the things that we know
There's no other place we can go

Told her everything that happened to me
A thousand limousines and the women for free
She said, 'That's when these words'll ring true  
You ain't nobody 'till somebody loves you.'

hang in and do that sweet thing you do

I've got some moves for you, baby, that I learned from way back when
I've got a feel for you, baby, you'll believe in love again
When I knock on you door, you'll let me in
In love again

We go round and round, don't know where we're bound
Long as there's a beat I'll hang around, for one more round

And honey, don't watch the TV 'cause the news is always bad
Come and dance with me tonight and you know your heart will be so glad

Grandpa can still keep it moving like he did so long ago

But we have to keep on living, find our strength somewhere
And I choose to keep on hoping, faith is still there
There are mysteries unbound, there is truth we've lost and found
The song lines are there, they will bring us back around
Deep in the heart they play, every day
Love life again, though you don't know how this day will finally end
Each day is music - reach till you find the song
Every day just keep on singing

Reaching for the stars, for the song of us all
Looking through the lonely night for a faith that will not fall for morning
Glad I'm here when morning comes, here when morning comes
One more day to keep on singing",Every Day (Oh Lord),1990
Steve Winwood,"Cry, you would cry in my arms
Far, far from the world and its harms
That kind of love begun is never done
I'll be here at close of day
When you bring your heart home to stay

I will be here when you call
I will be here standing tall
I will be here, you won't fall
Don't you know that love will save us after all?

Come - when cold winter blows
Come - when sweet summer glows
And all your wandering years will disappear
There are places inside the heart
We'll touch like we've done from the start

Almighty time rolls on, let's not spend it all alone
We are here, then we're gone",I Will Be Here,1990
Steve Winwood,"Had a dream last night, the angels had come riding
In the light of day where there was no more hiding
All so fine, I still see them shine
I saw angels play right in the light of day

And I watched them fly across a fiery sky
And I heard their cry as they passed me by
I could feel the light inside me, I could feel it everywhere
Life was clear and fair

Woke up in the dark and tried to keep believing
In the light I saw, in time of constant grieving
Vision fair, please don't disappear
And please hear my prayer there in the light of day

When I look within I see them shine again
As the darkness ends and the light begins
I can feel the light inside me, I can feel it everywhere
They are all still there

On the street tonight the innocent are dying
And the world's not right, so many millions crying
Evil lives and hate never gives, hell is never far
And is this all we are?

Oh, Lord, hear us cry, up in the fiery sky
That our souls may fly to you when we die
Help us feel the light inside us, help us feel it everywhere
Oh, Lord, be there",In the Light of Day,1990
Steve Winwood,"All over the night, the beat goes on
Can you hear it? Can you feel?
Through the years music keeps running
The beat keeps running on, on and on

And I'll always be feeling it, and I won't slow down
Just as long as those wheels go round
I'll be riding that fast train to Memphis
On that sweet are & be	
Till that green grass way down home grows up over me

You've been searching everywhere, I know you care
Walking down the endless street, what will you meet?

You'll keep on searching till the very end
For one true lover and for one true friend
You'll get your answer on the whispering wind
When you find it, just don't let go

Walked out in the pouring rain to stop your pain
Cried out on a mountain high, why life goes by?

Did we ever have fun?
The dust, the gentle legacy you left behind
Is falling softly on my mind

Dust, the timeless memory of you, I love you
I do for all the little things you do and I guess I always will

And the shadows hide the moon
Sleep will give you all that is left -

I saw a light falling from the sky and land beneath a tree
The light it gave was oh, so bright that it took away my care
I ran back to the house to tell you but you were not there
When you've loved someone dearly it's so hard not to regret
Memories that have faded, suddenly you can't forget
I know I was not dreaming when you walked right out the door
Just a feeling that told me my love was gone for evermore
When you think you've found the key, the door just slips away
And so you walk the floor all night until the break of day
Somewhere in your mind you know that things will be alright
Because everything in life is equal just like the day and night
You said you couldn't leave me after all that we'd been through
I believed you when you said that we should both try something new

Steve Winwood,"Christmas is now drawing near at hand
Come serve the Lord and be at His command
And God a portion for you will provide
And give a blessing to your soul beside

Down in the garden where flowers grow in ranks
Down on your bended knees and give the Lord thanks
Down on your knees and pray both night and day
Leave off your sins and live upright, I pray

So proud and lofty is some sort of sin
Which many take delight and pleasure in
Whose conversation God doth not dislike
And yet He shakes His sword before He strikes

So proud and lofty do some people go
Dressing themselves like players in the show
They patch and paint and dress with idle stuff
As if God had not made them fine enough

Even little children learn to curse and swear
And can't recite one word of Godly prayer
Who'll teach them better or teach them to rely
On Christ the sinner's friend who reigns on high",Christmas Is Now Drawing Near at Hand,1997
Steve Winwood,"Every little thing that can go wrong

They've let him stand 'til midsummer's day 'til he looked both pale and wan
And little Sir John's grown a long long beard and so become a man
They've hired men with their scythes so sharp to cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him by the way, serving him most barbarously
They've hired men with their sharp pitchforks who've pricked him to the heart
And the loader he has served him worse than that 
For he's bound him to the cart

They've wheeled him around and around a field 'til they came onto a pond
And there they made a solemn oath on poor John Barleycorn
They've hired men with their crabtree sticks to cut him skin from bone
And the miller he has served him worse than that 
For he's ground him between two stones

Would shoot at my shoulder

Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.

With thoughts as bold as thought can be

In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

Transmit all they know.

That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
He plays by intuition, The digit counters fall.

There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.
'How do you think he does it? I don't know.
What makes him so good?'
He ain't got no distractions, Can't hear no buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n' never tilts at all.

I thought I was the Bally table king.
But I just handed my pin ball crown to him.
Even my usual table, He can beat my best.

He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall.

If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

Threw clods upon his head,

To cut him off at the knee,
They've rolled him and tied him by the way,
Serving him most barbarously.

They've hired men with the sharp pitchforks,
Who pricked him to the heart,
And the loader he has served him worse than that,
For he's bound him to the cart

They've wheeled him around and around the field,
˜Till they came unto a barn,
And there they made a solemn oath,
On poor John Barleycorn.

They've hired men with the crab-tree sticks,
To cut him skin from bone,
And the miller he has served him worse than that,
For he's ground him between two stones.

And he's brandy in the glass;

Cause I know what you're feeling
When it turns out that way
And that emotion is healing
And we can fly...

We start with nothing, cause there's nothing left to hide
I believe in every new day
I'll never be that man who threw it all away
In the valley there's a river running through
Wherever it may take me, I will follow you
There's an answer to all the rain
It's when I turn around and hear you say my name

So fly...
And we can fly...
Oh what you're healing...
Cause there is nothing but clouds in your way
As we face the day...

So the time has come but I will say a prayer
As the day break, I know I will meet you there
By the shoreline ever-changing
I give my word to you, you gave your word to me

It was divided, but with you it feels whole
There's a life only we know

Summer is coming, warm the winter skies
Yellow sun to dry the rain that's clouding my eyes
Over the ocean, chasing lonely moon

Hurricane rising, thank the god I know
Feel my destiny to find my own El Dorado

There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright

Ask him how much of your mind, baby

Things are much harder than in the after world

Go crazy, punch a higher floor

Take a look around you
At least you got friends

That I've been given
Make a mess with the results

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

[Chorus]

So get this taxi movin' cause I got no time to lose
There's no time to be choosy, any old bar will do
Cause I'm lookin' to get silly and I'm lookin' to get loose
And if that don't get it done darlin', I'll come looking for you",Broken Hearted People (Take Me To a Barroom),2005
Steve Young,"I was born in a bunk
Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road

I grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a'hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road

But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road

I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road

Bring dynamite and a crane
Blow it up, start all over again
Build a town, be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road

Cause it's home
The only life I've ever known
I despise you ''cause your filthy
But I love ya, 'cause it's home",Tobacco Road,2005
Steve Young,"Elijah came to Texas 
To build his family a home 
With his wife and new baby 
And what little goods that they owned 
Had a good yoke of oxen 
And hand tools for clearing the land 
And he built him a church 
'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
All of his children when there 
Worshiped here through the years 
On down to my granddad 
He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here 
It's where I was baptized 
And where I took me a wife 
And if I have my say so 
That's where I'll rest when it's time 

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead and I'm gone 
Won't you carry me home 
To that little white church 
In my daddy's home town 

'Cause Lord knows I'm some kind of sinner 
But I've done come this far 
And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down 
This east Texas red dirt 
Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
And a hired hand named Regan 
First made me understand 
And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land

[Chorus:]",Elijah's Church,2006
Steve Young,"Me and ol' Bill there we both come from Georgia 
Met Hank out in New Mexico 
We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa 
We hear that he's payin' in gold 

I guess a man's got to do what he's best at 
Ain't found nothin' better so far 
Been called mercenaries and men with no country 
Just soldiers in search of a war 

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

When this war is over might go back to Georgia 
And settle down quiet some where 
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile 
Heard tell of some trouble down there

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way 

And we're bound for the border 
We're soldiers of fortune 
And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
Or the peso down Mexico way",Mercenary Song,2006

Steve Zegree,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2009
Steve Zegree,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life,2009

Chuck you in and watch you swim
Waiting for that big cha-ching

You're taking the fall now
You're taking the blame
It's taking you nowhere

Hit a pothole, just image we riding horseback 
On the coast Patrick Swayze 
Baby we getting ghost, can I tap that maybe 
We can pull up then hop out and walk in and roll up 
Now hold up say my name before I pull out

And he got his own, lane
