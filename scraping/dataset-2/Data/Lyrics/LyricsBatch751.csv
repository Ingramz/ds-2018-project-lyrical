Motorace,"Someone else standing in my shoes
Count the hours since he left his boots behind
Still in limbo think I'll stay up late
This infomercial's got me lifting weights for you

I'm sober
Is it over now?
Nights gone i'm still waiting
Another drink could save my life

what's this myth said we'd have good times?
I can't seem, to find, find my impulsive side
Just excuses and the lies
Simple things ain't gonna make me survive
This rock'n'roll thing still gives me life
and it's not gonna change
is it all that strange?

I'm sober
Is it over now?
Nights gone I'm still waiting
Another drink could save my life

Someone else standing in my shoes
Count the hours since he left his boots behind
Still in limbo think I'll stay up late

Yeah, I'm sober
Is it over now?
Nights gone I'm still waiting
Another drink could save my life
Tonight, yeah yeahah",Lorenzo,2002

Pull up in the Bentley with them skinny ass tires
Ice all over cause a nigga so fly (so fly)

Nothing on chain put them dubs on the thangs
Wipe a nigga down bitch give a nigga brains (wipe a nigga down bitch give a nigga brains)
Call a nigga changed ma wash a nigga range
Bird baby down with them cardier frames

Motorcity All-Stars,"Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else

Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do

Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside

When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause

Can't help myself I love you and nobody else

Television screams, your face turning green
Don't listen to the news
Don't know what you hear, they never make it clear
They like to keep your state confused
Propaganda time, the official line
You're hungry, you get fed
Everlasting smile, you must convey their style
But they're just a talking head

Television voice, don't give you any choice
You only hear the man
Don't take them in, you don't know where they been
'Cause it's a complex plan
They keep you nice and quiet, even control your diet
You're hungry, you get fed
Teach you to be meek, till all you are is weak
Till you're just a talking head

Remember what I say
Don't be hypnotized by sugar coated lies

To fight for a land fit for heroes,

Chasing my days down to zero,
And I marched and I fought and I bled and I died,
And I never did get any older,
But I knew at the time that a year in the line,
Was a long enough life for a soldier,

We all volunteered, and we wrote down our names,
And we added two years to our ages,
Eager for life and ahead of the game,
Ready for history's pages,
And we brawled and we fought and we whored 'til we stood,
Ten thousand shoulder to shoulder,
A thirst for the Hun, we were food for the gun,
And that's what you are when you're soldiers,

I heard my friend cry, and he sank to his knees,
Coughing blood as he screamed for his mother,
And I fell by his side, and that's how we died,
Clinging like kids to each other,
And I lay in the mud and the guts and the blood,
And I wept as his body grew colder,
And I called for my mother and she never came,
Though it wasn't my fault and I wasn't to blame,
The day not half over and ten thousand slain,
And now there's nobody remembers our names

When I was young I was the only game in town
I thought I had it down for sure,
But time went by and I was lost in what I found
The reasons blurred, the way unsure
I thought that I was living life the only way
But as I saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, I read the writing on the wall

I ain't no nice guy after all
I ain't no nice guy after all

You find there's lots of times you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock when that trip leads to fall",I Ain't No Nice Guy,1992
Motörhead,"See into the future
See into the past
I gotta tell you what I'm seeing in the glass
Tall dark stranger, knocking your door
Looking through the window, 
It's you he's looking for
Don't be acting crazy don't you cause a riot
Stand very still, 
Keep very quiet
You'll never see the face
Of the man in the window
Heart begins to race
He's the one to spring you a surprise
Aaah, the ripper master of disguise

See into the mind
See into the brain
Try to find the reasons that Jacky's out again
Slipping and sliding don't even try to hide
Just like your shadow, breathing at your side
Don't give into panic, 
Don't you run an' scream
Aaah, the ripper, haunting all your dreams

You'll never see the face
Of the man in the window
Heart begins to race
He's the one to spring you a surprise
Aaah, The ripper master of disguise

Cold steel, whisper in the night
He'll be at your side, with a smile and a knife
It's seems like dreaming, moving in the dance
The last embrace you'll ever know, The violence of romance
Don't try to run, you'll trip and fall
You'd be a fool
He's right beside you and he can be so cruel

Stand O very still your heart is beating like a drum
He turns his face towards you
And the two move as one
And so the mystery continues to beguile
The ones who know can never tell you of his smile

How can you see they move so fast
You're bound to lose",Jack the Ripper,1992
Motörhead,"The beast behind our eyes is loose,
The day has come, the day has come,
We march to Armageddon, hungry for the war
I see the hated enemy, I see what I was taught to see

And one of us will bend the knee
We understand the law

The blood lust jerks our legs to march,
Fife and drum, fife and drum
Our eyes are fixed and fearless
Searching for the war
Our statesmen deal in blood and lies
A hundred million stifled cries, a hundred million wasted lives
Already gone before

So march or die, march or die
The stench of death is in the sky
We never fail to satisfy
We rend with tooth and claw

Sword and shield and jackboot heel
We love to kill, we love to kill
We love to taste our own blood
Squirm in our own gore

Children weep and widows wail,
Our education systems fail,
To hide our guilt we build more jails,
And we shall build still more
Our forests die, the stranglehold
That we put on the earth for gold
Will yet increase ten thousand fold
And no one knows what for

March and die, march and die
Defecate, despoil and lie
Cheat, dissemble, preach & spy
Build your house of straw

Laugh and cry, laugh and cry
Bloody sunset drowns the sky
For earth the heal then we must die
No-one deserves it more

I tell you we are doomed my friends
Our time is come, our time is come
We live within a charnel house
Rotten to the core
We glorify lust, greed & pain
We drown our hope in poison rain
We point the finger, shift the blame
Ambition makes us whores

March or croak, march or croak
All your lives a cosmic joke
Fill your days with piss and smoke

Tell me what do you see, can you make out the facts

I still hear them talk, telling jokes in my head,

And so we bring the plague with us,

We bear your names but not your guilt,
We do not like the world you built,
Poisoned, ruined to the hilt,

Mommy's been gone a long time
Daddy comes home and she still sleeps
Waiting for the world's worst crime

And he comes up the stairs like he always does
And he never turns on the light
And she's wide awake, scared to death

And she listens to him breathe
She knows there's something awful wrong
That she's far too young to see

She's so full of guilt and shame
And if she tells she'll be all alone
They'd steal her Daddy and they'd steal her home

And it's not so bad when Daddy leaves her alone
Praying to her God with his heart of stone
Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight

Tell me why
The worst crime
In the world

And Daddy lies by his daughter's side
And he sleeps both deep and well
No nightmares come to him tonight
Though his daughter lives in hell

For his seed is sown where it should not be
And the beast in his mind don't care
And the only sounds are tears that fall
Little girl turns her face to the wall

In a world of my own at the back of the garden

The way I like to picture you

I pour a drink and watch the fight

Pick up the phone, fix some food

And takes to the stage in a secret life

So you turn on the smiles
'cause you think of the time
And nobody knows who you are
You don't think you'll get very far
I don't even know your name
At last they accept you
In case you go next year
And ask you to reach for the sky
And just when you're ready to die
They turn their back on you
So they put you on ice
In survival hotel
And wish you would die from the cold
When all you want is a night alone

Well I help her with her baggage for her baggage is so heavy
I hear the plane is ready by the gateway to take my love away.

It's getting me so.

Airport, you've got a smiling face,
you took the one I love so far away
Fly her away - fly her away - airport.
Airport, you've got a smiling face
You took my lady to another place
Fly her away - fly her away.

The plane is on the move,
And the traces of the love we had in places
Are turning in my mind - how I wish I'd been much stronger
For the wheels are turning faster as I hear the winds are blowing
and I know that she is leaving
On the jet plane way down the runaway.
And I can't believe that she really wants to leave me - and it's
getting me so,

Die Meere werden verdrängt
Die Wüsten beginnen zu wachsen
Der Regen beginnt zu brennen
Das Leben beginnt zu rennen
Viel sehen und nichts zu erkennen
Wir leben mit Niederschlägen
Wir wehren uns mit den Händen
Wehren uns mit Gesängen
Vermehren uns, sind uns fremd
Wo stehen wir nur
In der Schwebe der Schwere
Entsteht die Schere
Das Leben predigt die Lehre
Den Gegnern fehlt es an Ehre
Planet dreht sich um Knete
Raketen gehen in die Sphäre
Wir geben Hundert Prozent
Der Mensch, König des Dschungels, König von Nichts
Holz den Dschungel ab für schönere Sicht
Stutz dem Phönix die Flügel vor der Reise zu höheren Hügeln
Es war irgendwann das Ziel, doch wir zögern, ermüden
Der Schlaf scheint so willkommen, doch eilt mir davon
Ich schreibe ’nen Song, high im Beton
Heim will ich kommen
Aber dieser Weg ist noch weit durch die Dunkelheit also schein’ so wie Sonnen

Hab’ meine Zukunft nie geplant, ich bin damals einfach losgegangen
Die Show begann und heute schreit das Publikum meinen Namen
Wollt’ nie auf Partys sein, die Fans machen Musiker zu Stars
Im Nachhinein betrachtet war die Jugendzeit für’n Arsch
In der Schule nie am Start, keine Klausuren, kein Diktat
Wer selber sucht und hinterfragt, braucht kein gutes Resultat
Denn was gut ist für den Staat, muss nicht gut sein für uns
Sie verletzen mich, so texte ich mit Blut meine Kunst
Hab’ genug meiner Jungs scheitern sehen, wir bleiben stehen
Doch sollten weitergehen und Hürden einfach nehmen so wie ein Leichtathlet
Du findest deine Wege zum Glück
Als ich nur stehenblieb und nach vorne schaute, ließ mich dieses Leben zurück
Ich mein’, ich sterb’ nicht dran, doch lernte manchmal gibt es nichts zu Ernte Dank
Ich schalt’ die Birne aus, schalt den Fernseher an und denke mir nur

Hoffentlich denk’ ich nur zu viel nach
Alles ist gut und mir fehlt nur ein bisschen Schlaf
Hoffentlich fühlt es sich nur so an
Als wär’ die Krone auf meinem Kopf in Wirklichkeit ein Dornenkranz

Und unsere Arme reichen gerade, um die Glühbirne zu wechseln

MoTrip,"Ich wollte immer schon
Alles richtig machen man, ich hab’s versucht
Doch konnte nur bestimmte Wege gehen wie eine Schachfigur
Das Tor zum Paradies ist gleich da hinten, ich lauf darauf zu
Bis Hoffnungen am Horizont verschwinden wie ein fahrender Zug
Viel zu oft gab es diese Tage, die mich zweifeln ließen
Ich wollte starten, aber wagte mich nicht frei zu fliegen
Wir führen Kriege, kämpfen, für den Frieden ziehen wir Grenzen
Wie soll man den richtigen erkennen unter so vielen Menschen?
Halt dich an jene, die du liebst, sie helfen jederzeit
Du bist auf'm Trip und jeder Schritt bringt dir was bei
Jeder Stock, jeder Stein, jedes Wort, jeder Rhyme
Jeder Move und alles was du tust, kann dich befrei'n
Glaub mir, du allein hast in der Hand, wo deine Reise enden wird
Auch wenn es stürmt, du hast keine Zeit mehr zu verschwenden
Such' immer nach dem Sinn, doch weißt im Herzen, wo es hingeht
Wir sind unterwegs und finden unsere Fährte, wenn der Wind weht

Wir wollen raus, viele gehen in dieser Gegend dahin
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Wir können den Engeln nicht vertrauen und bewegen uns blind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht
Ich würde so gerne wissen, wer über mein Leben bestimmt
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Denn wir fliegen nur umher wie eine Feder im Wind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht

Ich wollte immer schon
Alle glücklich machen, doch wie soll das gehen?
Ich mein, ich wollte gehen,
Doch heute seh ich deine Äuglein tränen
Du stehst unter Druck, hast ‘ne Menge Stress, ist schon okay
Doch nur solange du deinen Kopf nicht hängen lässt wie Orchideen
Häufig fehlt uns die Zeit und Lust, wir opfern neun von zehn
Damit der Wind zumindest einen von uns über die Wolken trägt
Ich flog aus der Asche so wie Phönix, könnte stolz erzählen
Doch halt es nicht für nötig wie ein König, der sein Volk versteht
Lausch dem Wind, wenn er dann mal wieder durch die Bäume weht
Doch denk daran, dass du nichts ändern kannst, wenn du nur Däumchen drehst
Ich mach mich von all den Sorgen frei, bevor ich Vollgas geb
Den Ort, an dem du morgen sein willst, solltest du schon heute sehen
Damit du sicher durch das Leben kommst
Die Hilfe kommt nicht nur zu spät,
Sie ist nicht mal auf dem Weg zu uns
Und nein, wir suchen keinen, der uns raus aus der Krise führt
Wir wollen einfach nur den Hauch einer Brise spüren

Wir wollen raus, viele gehen in dieser Gegend dahin
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Wir können den Engeln nicht vertrauen und bewegen uns blind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht
Ich würde so gerne wissen, wer über mein Leben bestimmt
Wir sind unterwegs, wenn der Wind weht
Denn wir fliegen nur umher wie eine Feder im Wind
Wir finden unseren Weg, wenn der Wind weht

Ich fühl mich federleicht, ich flieg, wenn der Wind weht
Meine Freiheit hat mir niemand genommen
Als unsere Vorfahren damals losgingen, wusste niemand wo’s hingeht
Doch auch sie sind am Ziel angekommen

Und diese Ghettos haben wir selbst gemacht
Viele Kinder wachsen auf ohne Aussicht (ja)
Ja, ich weiß, wir leben beide in der selben Stadt
Doch ich spüre dein Vertrauen überhaupt nicht
Und geh ich raus, gibt's Probleme mit den Rechten
Und vor Gericht dann Probleme mit den Rechten
Wenn du das mit Menschen machst
Dann endet das im Fremdenhass
Und heutzutage nenn' wir das Probleme, die sich rächten
Halb Mensch, halb Mimimi, yeah
Kein Killer, wie man ihn im Krimi sieht
Wir sind clean, doch sehen aus wie auf Tilidin

Hier heut' Abend sehen?
Ihr müsst noch 'n bisschen warten
Ich erzähl' euch kurz was“

Yeah, ich sag dies' der Re-mi-mi-mix
Für Mitbürger mit Migrationshintergrund
Remix, viele von uns sind hier geboren
Doch die Herkunft steht immer im Mittelpunkt
Die Menschlichkeit ist ein Minimum
Sie schalten unsre Stimmen stumm
Sie nannten uns als Kinder dumm
Wir waren wie DJ Khaled, sie wollen nicht, dass wir gewinnen
Und schauten uns mit Mitleid an, als wär' es 'ne Behinderung
Hoo, heute rulen Mimimis
Boateng hängt mit Jigga rum
Gäb es hier keine Mimimis, huh
Dann gäb es hier auch keine Entwicklung, Statement
Robert kam damals aus Afrika, ah
So wie auch viele andere Habescha
Heut ist er ein nationaler Star
Und gewinnt Awards in Kanada, Gratulation
Uh, ich bin stoned, Mann, wo waren wir grad?
Ohladidadida, so viele Nazis da, so krasse Party grad
Lass mich diesen Beat hier killen
Eko hat 'ne Serie und einen eigenen Kinofilm
Nicht schlecht für'n Quotentürken, lass den Flow hier wirken
Dies geht an alle Mimimis in allen Wohnbezirken
Trip kam aus Libanon, nahm ein Mikrofon
Heute hat er viel Erfolg, Mimimis kriegen Gold, woo
„Hey, mach mal'n Song gegen Nazis, Sam“
Warum? Ich versteh das nicht
Ich hab noch nie was gegen die gehabt (sag es)
Die hatten immer etwas gegen mich
Lasst uns Fremden doch die Hand geben, yo
Anstatt hier jeden Tag 'n Brand legen
Und ohne viel Kollateralschäden
Hier in Frieden in diesem Land leben, alle meine

Ich bin der Vorzeige Kanake (Kanake)
Aber kann besser als viele deutsch (viele deutsch)
Jeder Türke klopft mir auf die Schulter (klopf klopf!)
Aber keiner, der sich Freezy käuft
Bisschen Fremdenhass liegt in der Luft
Gruß geht an die Pegida (Hoo Hoo)
Ich geh Samstagabend in den Puff (und?)
Und frage: „Ist die Peggi da?“
Manche machen einen auf korrekt
Dann nimm doch einen Flüchtling auf
Ich bin kein strenger Musilman
Aber esse Mama Müsli auf
Tja, das ist wie der Ek so ist
Ich date heut Beate Zschäpe
Sie sieht aus wie bei Exorzist (aber?)
Aber kennst ja, einmal blasen geht, ne?
Ja, ich bin ein Mimimi
Heul doch, Digga, Mimimi
Kanaken hören Jiggi-Beats

Mein Mann Chefket aus Berlin
Via der Türkei
Let's go, Bro“

Dis is' Chefket, kein Vorzeigetürke, Rapshit
Ich komm so rein, dann gibt es später kein Missverständnis
Ich hab das beste aus zwei Kulturen in mir vereint
Am plakativsten wär' jetzt 'n bisschen Spätzle und Chai
Bilingual mit zwei, trilingual mit zehn
In zwei Ländern zu Hause und ich kann alles verstehen
Doch viele wollten mich verarschen während ich mit Farben klecker'
Sie kommen und sagen: „Nur eine Farbe wäre besser“
Ich war nie gut im Mal- und Kunstunterricht
Schwarzweiß kann ich nicht malen, wenn alles bunt ist für mich
Und wenn man sich den Kopf über die fremde Dummheit zerbricht
Stellt sich die Frage: Warum eigentlich?
Einerseits, andererseits, ich bin mitten drin
Isst du Schweinefleisch? Nur wenn sie beschnitten sind
Identität kann für mich nichts damit zu tun
Irgendwelche Nationalhymnen mitzusingen

Just as much as you could take
And then your love turned bad and now I'm mad
Cause I made a big mistake
But if you think I'm gonna take it
Lying down like a dog
Well you'd better think again

He said, ?This won't do you no good, and sent for the police""
Well, they busted me for nothing, 'cause they said, I was insane
So, they let my body go, but they locked away my brain

Well, I wandered freely as a bird that had broken both it's wings
And I hated them and they hated me, and I hated everything
And I realize that to survive, well, my body is not mine
And I feel neglected feel rejected, living in the wrong time

And to those of you who always laugh
Let this be your epitaph

And my head is down and I'm called a clown by comedians that grace
The living stage of every page of worthless meaningless space
But I swear to you before we're though you're gonna feel our every blow
We ain't bleeding you we're feeding you but you're too fucking slow

Oh angeline, I love you, your mouth is like a sting
And when I close my eyes each night, I often hear you sing
Imagination's hidden book, you wrote it on the wing
And when I vowed to comfort you, well you swallowed everything

Angeline, oh my angeline
My sweet angeline - you have rendered me unseen
I would cry a million smiles for my indian city queen

Well your body it is broken in so many different ways
And when I stoop to find your head, well it disappeared in haze.
Your blood flows like the finest juice - the kiss of burgundy
And where it comes from no one knows, but where it's going I can't see

Angeline, oh my angeline
My sweet angeline - (y'know) you have rendered me unseen
I would cry a million smiles for my indian city queen

Angeline, oh my angeline
You little angeline - you have rendered me unseen
I would cry a million smiles for my indian city queen

And your crystal-coloured cardboard bins - attack me from the paint
And I think that I am getting lost among the swollen states
Oh rescue me or bury me, for I care not what you do
There is just one thing that I want to say am I really you

I've been sitting here thinking
When I started out drinking
I went on to the dope surely just to change my life
I cried a tear and a beer for me
I lost everything near and dear to me
Namely my children and my wife
I've an idea of having a good time
Was sitting up there with my head between my knees
Well I knew everything there was to know
Everything except which way to go
I cried oh God please take me will you take me please

(Yeah) Many a time (well I) swore up and down
I don't need none of this junk that's a floating round
I could quit - let me finish what I've got
After all this stuff sure costs a lot
Then I get my feet back on the ground
Now I can't tell nobody how to live their life
Even though inside we're all the same
All these things are toys I was playing with
You know, you know we're all losers in the end

(Well now) since I've been straight
I haven't been in my cups
I ain't shooting downs I ain't using ups
You know I'm still as crazy as a loon
Even though I don't run out and cop a spoon
Thank the good Lord God well I've had enough
I've got a friend and his name is Robertson
He told me ""Don't need to be stoned to know a friend
Believe me you're all beautiful people just the way you are
Tell me, what has that stuff done for you so far?""

I've been sitting here thinking I've been winking I've been blinking
Well I don't have to sit around no more on the nod
With my head in the air (you know)
I can do anything I can do it straight I can do it so much better now
Its gotta start
Right here in your own back yard
Yes it's gotta start back your own back yard
Everybody has their own beautiful back yard
You might find oil wells in your own back yard
You might find anything in your own back yard
You might even find my shadow in your own back yard

She moves my arm around 'cause she is burning
She has so much to give but so little time to live

As I look down the streets are slowly forming
And the ladies of the night have start performing
And the trash-collectors horn, salutes the dawning
And soon the work ward bound will they wake up yawning

Eight miles high and falling fast

With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune

Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Mott the Hoople,"Now Alice needed money.  I put ten dollars on the breeze.
As the wind died away, she sank way below her knees.
And as a hurricane passed by, she clutched the money from the sky.
She must have been at least a fathom high.
She works the forty second beat, on forty second street,
With all her golden ambitions, and dead rhinestones in her feet.
And when a stranger said she sucked, she just smiled, believing luck,
As she climed into his truck, to make a buck.
Oh my god, she's running 'round the trees,
Said she couldn't touch them because they're so real.
Alice you remind me of Manhattan;
The seedy and the snaz, the shoeboys and the satins.
Like a throne made of gilt that too many johns have sat in.
Oh, I got my eyes on you.
Now keep a watch on your watch, and a watch on her watch,
'Cause if you ain't too careful, he's gonna kick you in the crotch.
And you're out in the cold, and you know that you've been rolled,
And the cops don't even stop, and you feel old.
See, Alice really liked you, but you stayed a while too long.
Now she wants you to forget it, and come back before too long.
But make it quick if you could, she's gonna star in Hollywood.
The producer seems to think she's kinda good.
Me and my camera eyes, sitting on a fence,
Laughing at the lights of New York City.
Alice you remind of Manhattan;
The seedy and snaz, the shoeboys and the satins.
Like a throne made of gilt, that too many johns have sat in.
Oh, just come over.
Roll up.
See Alice on the palace, where her name adorns the boards.
Ain't no flash in her Cannes, she got the willpower of a horse.
And it's a long way to Broadway from a forty second lay,
Or is it really just a couple of blocks away?
Now, I wonder if she wonders, if I wonder, if she wonders
About the times I put her down, when she seemed to be right under?
She told me morals are traditions, contradictions, superstitions.
See, Alice is always based on split decisions.
Me and my stupidity, sittin' on a fence,
And digging what I thought was New York City.
Oh, Alice, you remind me of Manhattan;
The seedy and snaz, the shoeboys and the satins.
Like a throne made of gilt, that too many johns have sat in.
Oh, I like you.
Yeah, Alice, the lights were meant for you.
Your weaknesses, successful, and your selfishness the clue.
You gotta lose what you get, and for what you get, you lose.
Oh, I know it.
Oh, Alice, don't stop and think a minute,
Or your brain is gonna get ya, drop your heart right in it.
And you're a shooting star, and you'll die if you don't win it.
Yeah,
You didn't make the book.",Alice,1974

Why then did ya have to grin?  Now the blood rolls down my chin.
Oh, you know you painted so much blue, and I'm much younger than that too.
Oh, mirror, what did I do to you?
You're my voyeur; see every line; chase them to destinations,
On through time.
And you're my diary, yeah, the bitter truth.  Unexpurgated, a
mis-spent youth, oh.
Do you have to paint teeth green, when they're snowy, white and clean?
Do you have to make eyes red, when they're clear and fresh, instead?
Oh, mirror, I wish you'd lose your head.
Sometimes, I'm on a gig, and I'm feeling kinda good.
I run and look at you, just like a pop star would,
But you just glare at me with those dark, accusing eyes.
That say: ""My make-up's good... I'd like to... I'd like so much to...""
Oh, I'll never look at you again, 'cause I'm really not that vain.

Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm, I got my babe.
She's a right-on child, she goes smilin'.
Woohoo... Woohoo...
Sometimes I go over the line, she has to bring me down;
And the pride pulls heavy, makes some evil sounds.
But I'm in love with her, and she's in love with me.
And the sea runs calmer now, I kiss the love that sleeps.
Mmm, I got my babe, Mmm I got my babe.
She's a right-on child, she goes smilin'.

Wasn't the same, it felt like a different game
And the way you called out my name....

She don't even care, if you make her bleed, she does it,
She can do it better than Judy or Suzie, 
Wouldn't want to say that she's really choosy.
But if you find out that she gets about, just turn her round
If you're straight or bent, don't have to pay a cent,
''cause she does it... Free!
Only twenty-three, but boy you're telling me that she does it,
She can make you feel like a little schoolboy
Tie you up in knots, or she can be a kill-joy
But if you find out that she gets about, just turn her round.

Let her come along and take you by the hand,
Then before too long you'll reach the promised land,
Any problems that you've got she'll understand

She's more than just a friend ...
Girls like her are really hard to find,
Maybe it's her inquiring mind,
Don't know what it is,
But she makes me feel like this...

Come along with me, I want you to see how she does it,
Can't control myself, nor can no-one else when she does it,
We can even see her at the same time,
Nothing's wrong with that, in fact she'll think it's fine
I don't mind if you don't mind,
so come on now before someone gets in ...

Mott the Hoople,"I changed my name in search of fame to find the Midas touch
Oh I wish I'd never wanted then what I want now, twice as much
We crossed the mighty oceans and we had a few divides
But we never crossed emotion, for we felt too much inside

You know all the tales we tell, you know the band so well
Still I feel, somehow, we let you down
We went off somewhere on the way and now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus is in town

Buffin' lost his child-like dreams and Mick lost his guitar
And Verden grew a line or two and Overend's just a rock n' roll star
Behind these shades, the visions fade, as I learn a thing or two
Oh but if I had my time again you all know just what I'd do

Rock n' roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
We went off somewhere on the way and now I see we have to pay
The rock n' roll circus is in town

So rock n' roll's a loser's game, it mesmerizes and I can't explain

Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed

Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

His feet lay heavy on the road that led to birmingham
Unseeing eyes, defeated cries, the mysteries of men.
Many hears, the helpless tears that leave the troubled brow
A man once tall, he fought them, but he is older now.

For in your youth, you think the truth will always win the game
Some men are kings, some men are rook, some men are pawns to blame
But if your skin is coloured black, well the dice are hidden in
The minds of fools who twist the rules, so you can never win

Birmingham, birmingham, underneath your face
There's nothing but a space - you're hollow.

Unlighted sky, begins to cry, the shabby coat is weak
And homes with windows dressed in warmth, and mouths that never speak
His mind is dead, his visions spread that pass before his feet
And thankfully he wears that dream that shields him from the street

Goodnight my friend, this is the end, you'll never cry again
You'll never have to smile away the bastards and the pain
Is it too late, or can you wait to take another turn
And walk together down that road that leads to birmingham

There's nothing but a space - inside you.

Through me, you, you leave me speechless

You, you make me scared of you
You make me scared of losing concentration
You make me afraid of you
Make me afraid of losing conversation

All my friends say that you`re forbidden - fruitless
I hide away with you - I`m guilty - I`m guilty
You found my only weakness
You, you leave me speechless

Entertainment came and went
Why can`t you be more curious, adventurous, mysterious, sensuous

Your remote control
Is sending out patrols, I`ve go consumer sadness
Spray me - camouflage me - blind me
So I can`t see, help me through this madness

All those years I spent
Clingin` to your warm breast
All those words
I don`t think I guess

Gotta get you off my chest - you pest
You, you leave me speechless",Speechless,2006

Why hang around with clothes of another name
She'd got hair so dyed she lost too much inside
Ain't nothing left to hide in the game

Hey Rose, how do you laugh in your own show?
Try to fight the fears that rise within
No you're a rock 'n' roll slag, oh, you're such a drag
When you're trying to find a corner to inject

Hey Rose, so silently she goes
And I'm careful not to wake up, see your make up

Hey Rose, how do you laugh when she's on show, girl?

E a volte m'innamoro
E mi nascondo per farmi ritrovare

Avevo diciott'anni, ero da solo in mezzo a tanta gente
Festeggiavo ancora i compleanni
Maledetto me che ho fatto finta di niente

Aver paura di dimenticare
Vivere o morire
Aver paura di tuffarsi, di lasciarsi andare
E di lasciarsi andare

Giovani la sera, giovani nei suoni
Per poi vantarsi di avere due capelli bianchi
Non riesco a ricordare i nomi
Di chi mi abbraccia per fare finta di aiutarmi

Piccole città, piccoli pensieri
Qualcuno torna perché ha voglia di morire
Ho cambiato casa cento volte
Ce ne fosse una che mi ha fatto venire voglia di restare

E adesso vedo tutto un po' più chiaro
Un pianoforte suona ed un pensiero vola via
E a volte ho un po' paura
Non riesco mai a stare con una donna sola

Vivere o morire
Aver paura di dimenticare
Vivere o morire
Aver paura di tuffarsi, di lasciarsi andare
E di lasciarsi andare

Lei non la vedo da sei mesi
Spero stia bene con il suo lavoro
Riesco a mettere la mia vita in una valigia
E a volte riesco a stare anche un po' da solo

Smettere di odiare, smettere di bere
E avere voglia di cambiare idea continuamente
Ho imparato anche a farmi male
Di cambiare accordi no, non me ne frega niente

Perdonami per quello che non riesco a darti
E per non essere all'altezza della situazione
Perdona anche i silenzi di mia madre
E la mia giustificata distrazione

J'irai par les chemins

Quand j't'aurai dit, tu comprendras !
La premièr' fois que je l'ai vue,
Elle dormait, à moitié nue
Dans la lumière de l'été
Au beau milieu d'un champ de blé.
Et sous le corsag' blanc,
Là où battait son coeur,
Le soleil, gentiment,
Faisait vivre une fleur :
Comme un p'tit coqu'licot, mon âme !
Comme un p'tit coqu'licot.

C'est très curieux comm' tes yeux brillent
En te rapp'lant la jolie fille !
Ils brill'nt si fort qu'c'est un peu trop
Pour expliquer... les coqu'licots !

Elle m'a donné son beau sourire,
Et puis après, sans rien nous dire,
Dans la lumière de l'été

Mes lèvres sur son coeur,
Qu'à la plac' du baiser
Y avait comm' une fleur :

Comme un p'tit coqu'licot.

Ça n'est rien d'autr' qu'un'aventure

Ni cett' passion... des coqu'licots !
Attends la fin ! tu comprendras :
Un autr' l'aimait qu'ell' n'aimait pas !

Elle dormait, à moitié nue,
Dans la lumière de l'été
Au beau milieu du champ de blé.

Un jour, tu verras, on se rencontrera,
Quelque part, n'importe où, guidés par le hasard,
Nous nous regarderons et nous nous sourirons,
Et , la main dans la main, par les rues nous irons.
Le temps passe si vite, le soir cachera bien nos coeurs,
Ces deux voleurs qui gardent leur bonheur ;
Puis nous arriverons sur une place grise
Où les pavés seront doux à nos âmes grises.
Il y aura un bal, très pauvre et très banal,
Sous un ciel plein de brume et de mélancolie.
Un aveugle jouera de l'orgu' de Barbarie
Cet air sera pour nous le plu beau, l'plus joli !

Moi, je t'inviterai, la taille, je prendrai
Nous danserons tranquill' loin des gens de la ville,
Nous danserons l'amour, les yeux au fond des yeux
Vers une nuit profonde, vers une fin du monde.

Mount Eerie,"I had my hopes of how I would be
After living in exile
After closing your eyes to me

I even wrote scenes where I reemerged boldly
Bearded, alive, with eskimo eyes
New baby on my back, but from where?

But I didn't count the fact that I have ghosts in my mind
Stowaways. Great ghosts of my life
Great ghosts of old wives
And they're howling!

So I spent my wilderness time rolling on the ground
Pulling my hair, and wrestling them off
Yelling at no one, punching snow

I gathered ghosts and gave them my lecture
I bid them away, I pleaded and cried. I said
There's no room in my life for you, or you
Or your howling!

Let me undo these ropes and go on living without you
Not just change where we live
Go on get, I said

I had my hopes about how I would be after sending them off
After getting set free
But there's no such thing as living
Without their prowling

As you can see, having descended the hill
I still look like me
I still wallow like Phil
And forever will

I'm teeming with ghosts and I'm still whining for wives
Knitting my brow
But now I've surrendered
In fact, I have joined in

Should my hair be long?

Should my prayers be bronze? Are affairs so wrong?

And all echoes would be buried in the sound of living
The sound of my feet on the sidewalk
That was me treasure hunting, I would bury what I found
That was me the gold digger, underground

Quickly forgotten was that forgetful way of life
When I left home, when I lived as if I'd died
Sitting on a rock and doing nothing, alone for so long
In the dark I found my sight
There you name was, written large in letters bright!
And there my faith was!
""Worry not"" declared the night
In the great void of my life, I could feel the shape of what was missing
Like the way the Woolly Mammoth stands so tall and bold in our minds
I was shaken at the size of my cry
And the true love it described

A new day is dawning now and so ends my holy night
It's back to the world I go, back to the girls and shows
And other worldly woes, and their unfurling flows

Or go for walks at night
There's waterfalls, but you can stay dry

Or in the death and birth
I always wonder at each, my mother

Watching waves of rain pass over
Cold and dry by the window
I didn't turn a light on
The fireplace dead since last night
Emptiness inside, cold morning
Low grey sky immense living belly
Of a silver fur thing
In waves of weather the house lies
Piled up wood with me inside
I'm piled up dust, alive, dreaming
Or walking whirlpool of water
Awake and indifferent
Looking at cars go by and then get forgotten
Only a sound of a waterfall breathing out
In one long exhale
Rings in my ears for a moment
Then another wave of rain blows over
Greying out the light
The lawn through window seems undiscovered

A separate way of breathing it in

I go on describing this place
And the way it feels to live and die

The “natural world”
And whatever else it’s called
I drive in and out of town
Seeing no edge, breathing sky

And it’s hard to describe
Without seeming absurd
I know there’s no other world:
Mountains and websites

Dark smoke fills the air
Some from the fire in my house
Some from me driving around

I could see the lights of town
Through the trees on the ridge
On my way home in the dark

Not as a picture of the woods
But just to remind myself
That I briefly live

The gleaming stone
The moon in the sky at noon
There is no other world
And there has never been

I still walk: living, sleeping
Life in the real world of clouds
Clawing for meaning

Still when I see branches in the wind
The tumultuous place where I live
Calls out revealing

""Can you see the river in the branches
And know that it means you will die
And that pieces are churning?""

""Can you find a wildness in your body
And walk through the store after work
Holding it high?""

And your southern hospitality'

Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray
Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a mem'ry
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten ev'ry woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen

As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful

Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever

With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With my friends at the old country church
 
Precious years precious years, sweet memory
Oh what joy they bring to me 
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the old country church

As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
As I knelt at the old country church
There with Jesus above in his wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church

How I wish that today all the people would pray
As they did at the old country church
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did at the old country church",The Old Country Church,1993

That were burning

Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""

She got to bouncin and twerkin, my dick it start gettin hard
The lights and 'em got 'em movin my shit it start glissen hard
Told niggas that got to lookin I'm muggin them bitches hard
Already smoked about a half of dat shit I was trippin hard
So I made sure my niggaz was straight 
And kept her goin

I had to met her at the club
And I didn't even know her
I just looked her in her eyes
And I could tell that she was sober
That's a problem, bought some bottles
We started blowin and pourin
She got to bouncin and twerkin, my dick it start gettin hard
The lights and 'em got 'em movin my shit it start glissen hard
Told niggas that got to lookin I'm muggin them bitches hard
Already smoked about a half of dat shit I was trippin hard
So I made sure my niggaz was straight 
And kept her goin

Can't forget Ashley, yea she get nasty
Chopped her on campus right befo she changed classes (Yup!)

But when they let the liquor in em, shit they will rumble
When I work that lumber, big cucumber
Hit you and forget you, you's a one hit wonder

Hit you and forget you, you's a one hit wonder

L'industrie, je pille, fonctionne à la Master-P

Aux nom de mes animals, j'crée l'scandale
En fait je pollue comme Total
Tous ces élus à 2 balles
Car on aura que dalle
Autant transporter de la dope dans le cul d'un cheval
Pour réinvestir dans le hip hop
Animal, je crée le scandale
En fait je pollue comme Total
Tous ces élus à 2 balles
Car on aura que dalle
Autant transporter de la dope dans le cul d'un cheval
Pour réinvestir dans le hip hop

Je veux tout niquer dans l'industrie du disque avec des lyrics dits stricts
Kicker l'arbitre, récupérer tous les titres
Dealer ça m'intéresse as-p
Je préfère me faire du fric dans le rap
Sans baisser mon froc
Vu que des baltringues y en a en vrac
J'ai pas envie qu'une bande de tains-pu me braquent
Pour mon fric ou les lyrics que j'éclate
Je veux que mon rap se vende à 4 millions d'exemplaires
Et mettre official Mass, Ibrahim, Jean-Pierre
Y me faut de la maille avant qu'on m'enterre
J'ai pas envie qu'une bande de bouffons me fassent leurs putains de commentaires
J'ai que 16 piges, je suis juste un môme
Qui veut voir la concurrence avec de putains de gros hématomes

Eh ouais c'est ça, on va tout péter
C'est pour les frères qui toute l'année se mettent à criqueter
Illicites dans mon quartier
À tous ces porcinets ces garçonnets qui, comme au ciné
Dégainent leurs guns pour pouvoir te canner
Et y se prennent pour des gros bonnets
Mais moi je leur pisse dessus
Et après avoir pilonné, man je viens tamponner
L.I.M. sur leurs faces de fions
Car c'est violent comme le front Russe, donc heindeck à ton gros ventre rond

Y paraît que Paris sature, trop de sons
Beaucoup trop sont 92-I caricature mais je suis beaucoup trop sombre
Écoute la chanson fiston, je mutile, rien d'inutile, moi je gagne
Amateur de champagne, arracheur de pagnes
Je suis arrivé dans le son, retrace la guerre dans mes morceaux
Et si je me fais canner, pas besoin d'en faire une chanson
Déconseillé aux gens dits sensibles
Voyou tu peux sé-dan sur mon son ou celui des dissidents
Pas d'ici, enfants du ci-ment
Pas besoin de te faire un dessin
Par les décibels on décime, un truc à la Mesrine
Ghetto genre grand Dakar ou la médina
Khouya balance un peu de chichon dans ma chi-cha
J'écris des 12, des 16, beaucoup décèdent, garçon donne-moi à boire
Je veux la gloire sans la rançon

An exceptional difference why ask for more
Don't underestimate this here is real
Our personalities do not appeal

Let me see you bounce
Pound for pound
Ounce for ounce
Bounce baby bounce

Lend me just one ear
Make you go bazerk
When will this be worth
Come over whelm me
Paint what you like
Try not to speak
It's a moment in life

Chorus x 2

So fascinating the short life
We live, bring in some clarity
To deal with all this,
There is no reason,
Why we can't confront this
Crash all my symbols make it
Loud and lets live

Come over whelm me paint

Try not to speak
It's a moment in life
Don't underestimate this here is real

With our head in our hands
No where to run it seems we've
Run out of plans
Mirror is full of emptiness
But I'm still standing
Right here trying to understand
The reasons for you and me.

Chorus (x2)
Now some people wish
And some people pray
But I'll just sit and wish away.

Now If I said I wasn't
Job would you still try and test me and if I said
I could cry would you still
Try to make me break me
Mistake me

For we have come so far
Like a mile fall of letters and songs
It seems my friend but anyway

Just look at us now
With our head in our hands
No where to run it seems we've
Run out of plans
Mirror is full of emptyness
But I'm still standing
Right here trying to understand

Repeatedly 
Still duplicating

An action replay 
Identical twins 
A photocopy 
Once again 
Same scenario 
Well I suppose so 
Shackled to boring life's

Spread your wings and fly 
Cross the boundaries of our heart

Can't you see 
It's killing you it's killing me

Recycled anger 
And plastic smiles 
Pattern of splender 
Bonafide 
Ancient history 
On a merry go round 
Repeating like grains of desert sand

We take one step forward 
And one step back 
Predicted the motion 
Hypnotised 
Exactly same time 
We both grew cold 
Reminder of unexpected love we found 

Spread our wings and fly 
Cross the boundries of your hear

Can't you see 
It's killing you it's killing me

Still always I've searched for something more
Now you know that you can count on me
'cause you've proved that you are all I need

And I know that they can not hurt me now
Yeah I know that they can not touch me now

Music makes me fly higher and higher
It drives me on, the heat under my skin
Music you're my brother, sister, lover
You complete me from without and from within

I've been cruel, I've hurt and left before
Looking back I only wanted more
You were there right from the very start
It was you, the one to win my heart

And I know that they can not hurt me now
Yeah I know that they can not touch me now

Dance the night away

I guess I'll have to stay

Another drink OK
Sippin' on my dry martini
I look at you and say

I like how you turn me on (4x)

Funky how love can deceive
Tell me all the wonderful things I should believe

An exceptional difference why ask for more
Don't underestimate this here is real

Lend me just one ear
Make you go bazerk
When will this be worth
Come over whelm me

Try not to speak
It's a moment in life

So fascinating the short life
We live, bring in some clarity
To deal with all this,
There is no reason,
Why we can't confront this
Crash all my symbols make it

Know I don't wanna hate you
And I don't wanna cry myself to sleep
Or get a nervous breakdown

And some people pray

Mistake me

Like a mile fall of letters and songs
It seems my friend but anyway

How come we ain't-getting busy, thought that we'd be-making babies
Read the signs-can you see, I've been patient-until now

It's to late baby-too late baby, the sex has gone
It's to late baby-too late baby, the sex has gone

Now you're saying, no more playing,
Wanna give your-self to me
Must have thought I-had forever
But your thinking-was way off key
Girl I still feel, something for you
It not the same-as it was before
Someone else has-got me confused
'cause she's giving-so much more

I guess I'll have to stay
Music's hot here at this night spot
Another drink OK
Sippin' on my dry martini
I look at you and say

I like how you turn me on (4x)

Funky how love can deceive
Tell me all the wonderful things I should believe
When it tells her the same then love becomes a game
I land softly on my feet so naive

Turn me on I've got the fever
Switch me off now I can't believe ya, baby

Come on and milk it while you're hot
Sell out hang out with a new set of friends
Take the arty farty out your eyes
Smoke this chill out enjoy the ride
You know it's true
You know we do need you to
Sell a million or two
'cause your last record sales weren't high.

Oh so cheesy but we don't mind
Let's get greedy taking it all from behind
So cheesy but we don't care
'cause we're running outta underground


So switch the light out on the cat walk 'cause
The pussy died long ago
Have a drink on me and even more
Hands up snap shot with your pants down
You know it's true
You know we do need you to
Sell a million or two
'cause your last record sales weren't high.

Oh so cheesy but we don't mind
Let's get greedy taking it all from behind

Playin' in freak shows bars and peep shows

No attempt to change a trend gaining momentum
None the less I must confess that I've seen
All the fruits of labor that you can receive
But it's rotten when you get there
Do believe gone to seed
How can you act like a friend to those you steal from
You hug and embrace them with open arms
I learnt to never trust a person like that
Or it's an arm around your shoulder and a knife in your back

The streets are paved with gold
But its only fools gold that you'll get
So strong yet you can't fight temptation
The easy way out is your only solution
The streets are paved with gold
But its only fools gold that you'll get
So strong yet you can't fight temptation
The easy way out is your only solution

You'll never know what its like to have some sense of pride in yourself
You'll never know what its like to have some piece of mind
When you know that you don't do wrong
Every time I look into your eyes 
Let me say that it won't be long
Till I walk into your line of fire
Let me say I'll stand strong
I'm not afraid to let your secret out
Yet people talk and shout out
You won't believe but when it's your bridges have burnt 
And the ash washed away
You'll feel the blow with every word that I say

Well seasons change but patterns stay the same
A routine never broken it's the crime of staying sane
One day you'll want to run
One day you'll want to hide
One day your going to look back at the things you left behind
I said that I don't know what you could be thinking
Sailing on a ship that's slowly sinking
You ain't the same person when you're drinking
Taking all you can your never content with what you're given 
Yes I know because I've seen it in the mirror
And I know it won't be long before you fall
Lack of control
Lack of a feeling you belong
You're on your own
If that's your choice then carry on
Because there's nothing I can say or do to stop you
Rule of the streets says that you do what you got to
But others around with watch the rise in your revenue
And sooner or later they're going to take it from you

The streets are paved with gold
But its only fools gold that you'll get
So strong yet you can't fight temptation

Moving Hearts,"They dropped the bomb in '45 to end the world war,
No-one had ever seen such a terrible sight before,
The world looked on with eyes wide to see where it might lead,
The politics of power, they passed around to see,
It was a time to remember, we never can forget,
They were playin' Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian Roulette.
They arose like the saviours of our modern human race,
With radiation haloes, that hung about their face,
With the key to the sure-cure, the treatment of our ills,
A hot-shot of cobalt, and a pocket-full of pills,
Speaking always of the enemy, who lurked across the sea,
While they crept in among us like a carrier disease.
Deep down inside the bunkers of the concrete and the lead,
Einstein's disciples working steadily ahead,
Making heavy metal power-plants to fire the city lights,
All you can hear in the underground is the humming through the night,
And the walls of tight security, circle all around,
Where they spill out their poison and bury it in the ground.
Holed up in the harbours hidden secretly away,
War-heads and submarines await to make their play,
The military masterminds improve on their design,
The soldiers get all doped up and stumble through the lines,
While the spills into the rivers get carried out by the tide,
They call this security but we're not satisfied.
Our statesmen and leaders and politicians pay,
Quick to heed the hand that feeds, they're careful what they say,
They call out experts to assure us, to wave their magic wands,
This is the power of the future, And the future marches on,
And they call in their favours, all their political gains,
While the spills fill the rivers and settle in the plains.
They've caused the death of millions, that's their stock and trade,
They will be afflicted by the fallout that they've made,
They've sealed their own inevitable doom, it must surely come,
Not even the moons of Jupiter will be far enough away to run,
When this earth that they've assaulted, begins to turn around,
And the unavoidable gravity, sucks them to the ground.
I know the minds behind them, they are riddled full of holes,
Not to be trusted with their hands at the controls,
Their eyesight it is twisted by the glory of their careers,
The heaped praise and flattery is music to their ears,
To listen to them talk about how it hasn't happened,
Yet's like playing Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian Roulette.",Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian Roulette,1982

Kommer från rätta stadsdelen, det är det som är problemet
Jag växte upp i det finaste kvarteret
Min pappa han är designer med mera
Min andra farsa, han är redan försenad
Själv var jag bara barn och adopterad
Så skolgången blev ytterst svårt komplicerad
För klasskamraterna tyckte det verka' fel att
Och lärarinnan skulle snart pensioneras
Inte deras fel att det hela blev som det blitt
Enligt rekommendationer från Den Heliga Skrift

""Johans pappa, passa er, han är antikrist!""
Enligt fröken som försökte förklara det, visst
Men, man kanske borde skjutit'na
Eller åtminstone burit ut'na

Husefriden eller dylikt
Har knappt någon tid att lyssna på din kritik
Inte Lykke Li men ganska så lycklig
Så tant ge mig en chans och lyssna på min musik, men nej
Tar inte seden dit jag kommer
Om skeden är av silver så tar jag den när jag kommer
Har de sagt så många gånger
Så tack men nej tack, jag hittar till utgången

Jag är ju svensk och går före i kön
Till och med man och har högre lön
Såtillvida att jag inte sitter arbetslös

Hur ska man möjligtvis kunna bli lycklig om fantasin inte kan få va på riktigt
Plockar på mig rymddräkten, oviktigt, ryggsäcken och min lilla schweiziska fickkniv
Brukade drömma om att bli större, stark och lika lång 
Som Robin Hood, otecknad, Kevin Costner
I en halvfull biosalong och skaffa båge, pil och filmpostern
Gått från pojkstreck och indragen veckoslant till pumpa Wu-Tang, snackat fake ghettoslang
Numera gör man det ingenting alls men tar det till toppen, Lil Wayne, Fuglesang
Plankat istället för SL-biljetter, bandat av grannarnas blandband på kassettdäcket 
Brorsan käkade diskmedel, trodde det var minttabletter
Har rökt sjögräs och låtsats det var cigaretter, inte längre
Numera ska det vara pengar på bankgiron, hyran auto dito, á la R2D2

Jag tog mig in från marknivå till astronom och jag ville bli rapikon, de sa det var ganska svårt så jag
Gick till skolan med min nya ryggsäck men låtsades som att det var en rymddräkt
Precis som om man siktar för lågt, då hamnar man lågt

Är hälften av det jag minns och det jag har förträngt
Var bra på långdistans men kunde inte hoppa längd
Jag blåste mina drömmar i ballonger som jag knöt på balkongen
Barndomen, ingen ånger eller strul
I den skötsamma åldern, jag njöt alla gånger
Men tolv år, full av fan, bröts alla tvången
""Han har egna idéer och han sitter aldrig still 
Och han gör inte som vi vill""
Jag kuta runt som om min röv sköt lågor
Spelade kulor, gjorde karateslag på judon
Och busboy Bosak var sång och inga frågor
Och ""Nu, nu, nu, nu, nu!"" var mina budord
Snodde så många äpplen, kunde hängt med Movits!
Palla plommon, palla aldrig inte kallas modig
Jag skrev raptexter, kickflippa tre sexti
Artist eller proffs, allt annat skets fett i
Gick från flerfaldigt klantarsle

Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn, my senses finally blurred.

He was a rock, to the end, a solid reminder,
Couldn't deny a friend.
We lived in the noise and the sweet amber poison,
Peeking up the skirt of the end.

And we'd drink two gnarly dudes and some records.
Much like plates of black food,
We filled up our faces, saw some far places,
Stood on the roof in the nude.

And the band played on as the helicopters whirred.
Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn, my senses finally blurred.

Between poles, he said We're like cows in the grass,
Brushing off flies.
Chaise lounging around, standing up, falling down,
'Til we no longer opened our eyes.

And we'd drink.
Ever notice how drinking's like war?
Cup o' troops o'er the gums
To the end of our health, a campaign 'gainst myself
Armed with bourbons and scotches and rum.

And the band played on as the helicopters whirred.
Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn, my senses finally blurred.

Think of bombs.
We're poised on the edge of disaster.
Whether it's right or it's wrong.
We opened the window,

Played some nintendo,
Sang a few bars of some pretty old song
'Irene good night, Irene good night
Good night, Irene. Good night, Irene.
I'll see you in my dreams.'

Oh to dream.
Those impotent bones of extinction.
Flying graceful and free.
None but the best cause the man cannot rest,
'Til he's finally beaten his me.

And the band played on as the helicopters whirred.
Drunk on the lawn in a nuclear dawn, my senses finally blurred.

'Til the end, he passed out on the sundeck that morning.
Quietly saying good bye,
But I was so hammered I sputtered and stammered.
Told him he couldn't just die.

He was rock, went straight for his own Armageddon.
Face froze in a grin.
Ambulance flying in
I never drank again

Moxy Früvous,"We got a call to write a song about the war in the Gulf
But we shouldn't hurt anyone's feelings
So we tried, then gave up, 'cause there was no such song
But the trying was very revealing
What makes a person so poisonous righteous
That they'd think less of anyone who just disagreed?
She's just a pacifist, he's just a patriot
If I said you were crazy, would you have to fight me?

Fighters for liberty, fighters for power
Fighters for longer turns in the shower
Don't tell me I can't fight, 'cause I'll punch out your lights
And history seems to agree that I would fight you for me

So we read and we watched all the specially selected news
And we learned so much more 'bout the good guys
Won't you stand by the flag? Was the question unasked
Won't you join in and fight with the allies?
What could we say we're only twenty five years old?
With twenty five sweet summers, and hot fires in the cold
This kind of life makes that violence unthinkable
We'd like to play hockey, have kids and grow old

Fighters for Texaco, fighters for power
Fighters for longer turns in the shower
Don't tell me I can't fight 'cause I'll punch out your lights
And history seems to agree that I would fight you for me
That us would fight them for we

He's just a peacenik and she's just a war hawk
That's where the beach was, that's where the sea
What could we say we're only twenty five years old?
And history seems to agree 
that I would fight you for me
That us would fight them for we

You don't need soaps to clean your mind
Every little child learns
If you can't see dreams, your eyes are blind
Was it just a fool's impression?
Such an antiquated passion.
On the day they both conspired to ride the midway after dark
They had enough of their pride to not bring coins to this amusement park
And she held his hand to follow
And he held his breath, then let go
They crouched down low.
Sat in the front row.
Untied the rope so they could fly
Hold on tight, let's get it just right,
We'll take our last flight. You and I.

liner notes, but not in the song itself]
When you're getting tired of normal
You sometimes think you've lost your will
You see something less formal
And reconcile to try to move in for the thrill
Was it breaking down like most do?
Or searching for happiness where you're supposed to?

So they cried inside while their eyes smiled
There was no turning back for two
Erase the memory stockpile
All alone, and one thing left to do
In the roller coaster shadows,
They took off their shoes and bared their souls
They crouched down low.
Sat in the front row
Untied the rope so they could fly
Hold on tight, let's get it just right

Galileo, Netwon, Watt, they were genuises all.

James Joule found total energy remains the same

No matter what it's form.
(Mike)
That's why it carries his name.

A chemical, electrical, potential and heat,
Radiant, kinetic, ooh the list is incomplete.

I've forgotten nuclear!

(All)
Ride a barrel down the falls
Then cook spaghetti with meatballs.
Really make your friends amazed.
Nuke it with some gamma rays.
Fly to Venus in a rocket.
Put your finger in a socket.
You may suffer from exhaust,
But none of that energy is ever really lost.

(Murray)
Then why can't we make a clean machine that moves perpetually?
Cause there's another law with which all energy must agree.
Whenever it changes form, it loses quality 

(Dave)
in other words...

(Murray)
Down/Damn that rising entropy!

It's entropy you see that turns finess into mess
A palace to a pig-stye why it's simply scandalous!
Energy once neat degenerates into waste heat (We must repeat.)
Because of entropy.

It was clear that relationship wouldn't last
It was clear from the way she had to sleep south
It was clear from the lines around her mouth
So I went for a walk in the ravine
I came upon an unbelievable scene
In a tiny creek there's a tiny boat
With a tiny man in a tiny coat
I said ""Hey man, do you think you can help?""
He said ""Of course I can - I'm an elf
We're not just fictional device
