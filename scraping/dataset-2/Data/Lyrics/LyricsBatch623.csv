Lou Reed,"Take me for what I am  a star newly emerging
Long simmering explodes  inside the self is reeling
In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood
In the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

At 5 am the moon and the sun  sit set before my window
Light glances off the blue glass we set  right before the window
And you who accept  in your soul and your head
What was misunderstood  what was thought of with dread
A new self is born  the other self dead
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

A soul singer stands on the stage  the spotlight shows him sweating
He sinks to one knee  Seems to cry  the horn are unrelenting
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard
In the microphone's face he sees her face growing large
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

As the twilight sunburst gleams
As the chromium moon it sets
As I lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling
",Set the Twilight Reeling,1999
Lou Reed,"When I think of you baton rouge
I think of a mariachi band
I think of sixteen and a crisp green football field
I think of a girl I never had

When I think of you baton rouge
I think of a back seat in a car
Windows are foggy and so are we
As the police asked for our i.d.

So helpless
So helpless

Ooohhh, ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless
So helpless

Well I once had a car lost it in a divorce
The judge was a woman of course
She said give her the car and the house and your taste
Or else I set the trial date

So now when I think of you baton rouge
And the deep southern belles with their touch
I wonder where love ends and hate starts to blush
In the fields in the swamps in the rush

In the terra-cotta cobwebs of your mind
When did you start seeing me as a spider spinning web
Of malicious intent and you as poor, poor me
At the fire at the joint, this disinterred and broken mount
In the bedroom in the house where we were unmarried

So helpless, so helpless
So helpless
So helpless, so helpless
So helpless

When was I the villain in your heart
Putting the brake on your start
You slapped my face and cried and screamed
That's what marriage came to mean
The bitterest ending of a dream

You wanted children and I did not
Was that what it was all about
You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
I wish I had


So helpless, so helpless
So helpless
So helpless, so helpless
So helpless

Sometimes when I think of baton rouge
I see us with two and a half strapping sons
One and a half flushed daughters preparing to marry
And two fat grandsons I can barely carry

Daddy, uncle, family gathered there for grace
A dog in a barbecue pit goes up in space
The dream recedes in the morning with a bad aftertaste
And I'm back in the big city worn from the race of the chase
What a waste

So thanks for the card the announcement of child
And I must say you and sam look great
Your daughter's gleaming in that -
- white wedding dress with pride
Sad to say I could never bring that to you that wide smile

So I try not to think of baton rouge
Or of a, of a, of a mariachi band
Or of sixteen and a crisp green football field
And the girl, and the girl I never had

So helpless, so helpless
So helpless
So helpless, so helpless
So helpless

Lou Reed,"Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
Big sky, big sky holding up the moon
Big sky holding down the sea
But it can't hold us down anymore

Big sky holding up the stars
Big sky holding Venus and Mars
Big sky catch you in a jar
But it can't hold us down anymore

Big sky, big enormous place
Big wind blow all over the place
Big storm wrecking havoc and waste
But it can't hold us down anymore

Ooohhh, big goals, big ambitious goals
Big talk, talking till I fold
Big wind talking through torrential love
But it can't hold us down anymore

Big sin, big sin, big original sin
Paradise where I've never been
Big snake break the skin
But you can't hold us down anymore

A big house holds a family
A big room it holds you and me
It's a big mess and baby makes three
But you can't hold us down anymore

Big news, they're out of their heads
Big-big-big news, let's fuck them instead
There's a big joke did they think we were monks
But they can't hold us down anymore

A big doll big enormous eyes
Big love holds you in a vise
A big man who cut them down to size
They can't hold us down anymore

Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
Big sky holding, holding up the moon
Big sky holding down the sea
But it can't hold us down anymore

Oh, big doll, big enormous eyes
Big love holds you in a vise
A big man who cut them down to size, ah
They can't hold us down anymore

Lou Reed,"They call you ecstasy
Nothing ever sticks to you
Not Velcro, not Scotch tape
Not my arms dipped in glue

Not if I wrap myself in nylon
A piece of duct tape down my back
Love pierced the arrow with the twelve
And I can't get you back

Ah, ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ah, ecstasy

Across the streets an old ford, they took off it's wheels
The engine is gone
In it's seat sits a box
With a note that says, goodbye charlie, thanks a lot

I see a child through a window with a bib
And I think of us and what we almost did
The Hudson rocketing with light
The ships pass the statue of liberty at night

They call it ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy
Ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy

Some men call me st. ivory
Some call me St. Maurice
I'm smooth as alabaster
With white veins runnin' through my cheeks

A big stud through my eyebrow
A scar on my arm that says, domain
I put it over the tattoo
That contained your name

They called you ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy

The moon passing through a cloud
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you

They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
I can't hold you up
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
No engine, no hood

I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
And I hope that they can play
But if we have to part
I'll have a new scar right over my heart
I'll call it ecstasy

Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy",Ecstasy,2000
Lou Reed,"Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
Split like a cord of wood my family broke up
Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
A breathing piece of shit

Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
A tree or a piece of steel I could do
What my fat owner can't

Ah, future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America

Ah
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
Kill them whenever you can

Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America

These -
Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
Every one of us here shares a surname
This father must die

I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
My father was dark, my mother was light
Look at me, I'm strong
I could crush him in my fist

Ah
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist

I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist

I could crush him in my fist

I could crush him in my fist

I could crush him in my fist",Future Farmers of America,2000
Lou Reed,"Good morning, it's possum day
feel like a possum in every way
like a possum

Possum whiskers, possum face
possum breath and a possum taste
ooohhh, like a possum

Possum tales, possum eyes
possum bones, possum thighs
oh, like a possum

Possum shots, possum runs
possum sleeps to possum drums
calm as an angel

Good morning, it's possum day
I feel like a possum in every way
like a possum

Wake up with a possum smile
look at me, look at this smile
like a possum

Things are all right, don't worry about this
my mind's amiss, I've lost the kiss

My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
and I say as one possum to another like a possum
calm as an angel

The only thing I hope to never see
is another possum in this tree
playing possum

Just like a possum

I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
it won't be filled by a one-night fuck

Slurping and squeezing ain't it just my luck
got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
the size of a truck

The devil tried to fill me up but my down was high
as the sky is up, ah
ain't that just my luck
calm as an angel

Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
shooting and coming 'til it hurts
calm, calm, ah, calm
calm as an angel

They're mating like apes in the zoo
ah, one for me and one for you
wouldn't it just be lovely

Another useless night in bed, ah, ah
by the Hudson River, the roller-bladers giving head
used condoms float on the river edge's head

Wouldn't it be lovely
wouldn't it be lovely

I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
it won't be filled by one-night fuck
like a possum
like a possum

Ahhh
calm as an angel

You know me I like to dance a lot
with different selves who cancel out
one another
I'm the only one left standing

One likes muscles, oil and dirt
and the other likes the women with the butt that hurts
like a possum

Devil tried to fill me up
but my down was high as the sky is up
calm as an angel

I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
and it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
like a possum

You know me I like to drink a lot
and carry on
don't know which self will show up, ah
over the 5 a.m. sun, -

- The moon is shining
over the docks shining
ooohhh, calm as an angel

Girls in the market know what I'm about
they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts, ah
with a pierced tongue licking below a stained T-shirt

Look at this smile

My mind's amiss

Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
shooting and coming 'til it hurts
calm, calm

Sitting on a curb I throw a rock
at the passing meat market trucks
it's just my luck
I'm the only one left standing

Now you know me I like to drink a lot, ah
only one left standing

The girls in the market know what I'm about
they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
licking below a stained T-shirt
calm as an angel

Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
shooting and coming baby 'til it hurts
wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be

Wouldn't it be love
wouldn't it be lovely
calm as an angel

Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
it won't be filled by one-night fuck

Ain't it just my luck
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck

Another useless night in bed
walk down the Hudson River getting head
calm, calm, calm, calm, calm as an angel

Don't know why baby, I'm still here strong
and fearless in the outside air
I'm the only one left standing

I'm the only one
the only one
the only one left standing

I'm the only one
I'm the only one
left standing
calm as an angel

I'm the only one
I'm the only one, the only one
left standing
calm as an angel

Shooting an coming 'til it hurts
o'holy morning

Calm as an angel

Lou Reed,"Mad, you just make me mad
I hate your silent breathing in the night
Sad, you make me sad
When I juxtapose your features, I get sad
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
But I was so tired, I was so tired
Who would think you'd find a bobby pin?
It just makes me mad, makes me mad
It just makes me, makes me
Mad
Glad, when I'm gone you're glad
That overwhelming tension dissipates
Oh, Tad, you think I'm a baby
Nobody likes to hear
Why don't you grow up at dawn
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
But I was so tired, so tired
Who would think you'd find a bobby pin?
It makes me mad, makes me mad
Don't you know it just makes me
Mad
It just makes me mad
Dumb, you're dumb as my thumb
In the wistful morning, you throw a coffee cup at my head
Scum, you said I'm scum
What a very lovely, feminine thing to do
Bark, why don't you just bark?
Sit, come, stay are the perfect words meant for you
Ah, ass, you says I'm an ass
You better call 911 'cause I'm gonna hold you tight
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
But I was so tired, so tired
You said you're out of town for the night
And I believed in you, I believed you
And I was so tired
It makes me so mad
It makes me so
Mad
It makes me so mad
It just makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad, ah
Dumb",Mad,2000
Lou Reed,"Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam
In a side street in a big canal
Spend my evenings in the Van Gogh Museum
What a dream, Van Gogh Museum
Maybe its time to see Tangiers
A different life-style some different fears
And maybe I should be Edinburgh
In a kilt in Edinburgh
Doin' a modern dance
Doin' a modern dance
Or maybe I should get a farm in Southern France
Where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance
And you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon
Moon in June and sleep till noon
And maybe you and I could fall in love
Regain the spirit that we once had
You'd let me hold you and touch the night
That shines so bright, so bright with fright
Doin' a modern dance
Doin' a modern dance
Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan
Where women are women, a man's a man
Ah, no one confused, ever loses place
With their place in the human race
Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
The smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
And maybe you don't want to be a wife
It's not a life being a wife
Doin' a modern dance
Doin' a modern dance
So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
Where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep
Or go to India to study chants
And lose romance to a mantra's dance
I need a guru, I need some law
Explain to me the things we saw
Why it always comes to this
It's all downhill after the first kiss
Maybe I should move to Rotterdam
Maybe move to Amsterdam
I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain
Afghanistan where there is no rain
Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
Where roles are shifting the modern dance
You never touch you don't know who you're with
This week, this month, this time of year
This week, this month, this time of year
Doin' a modern dance
You don't know who you're with modern dance
I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan
Dance, you don't know who you're with
Dance, you don't know who you're with
Modern dance
And maybe you don't want to be a wife
It's not life being a wife
Doin' a modern dance
You never touch you don't know who you're with
Dance, modern dance
The roles are shifting dance
You never touch you don't know who you're with
Dance, modern dance
Maybe you don't want to be a wife",Modern Dance,2000
Lou Reed,"It was only the time of the newly born dead
With wispy cobwebs in your head
The polar moon looked out instead
Goin' wild

Liquor shifting through the brain
The manic depressive goes insane
Goin' wild
Goin' wild

Desperate anger hits the streets
By the foul smelling river by the meat market
Goin' wild
Mystic child

Goin' wild

In the winter with frozen toes
Looking out the big windows
To fly
Goin' wild

Situation X out of control
My eyes half opened like a mole
Who smiles
Goin' wild

Who smiles
Goin' wild

In the mystic morning where the river meets
The hurdy-gurdy of the hip-hop beat
Five a.m., the viscous street

Oh, wild
Goin' wild

Out the window like a flash
Fallin' through a rooftop crash
Blind
Goin' wild

Sick and misty like a pup by the curb
He's throwin' up
Wild
Like a child

Goin' wild
Like a child

If he can't have all that relates
To testify that he is great
He'll cut someone with a broken plate
Stand upon the subway grate

And smile
Goin' wild
Goin' wild
With a smile

Holy morning
Sun is up and someone
Here has lost his cups

The dawn is tattered all cut up
Goin' wild
Like a mystic child

Like a mystic child
Sunday morning, looking down from the rooftop
Goin' wild with a smile
Mystic child

Top of the world; he's got it made
Rings are gold, braids are jade
Jumped to the street; he's got it made
Goodbye, child

Goodbye, child

Lou Reed,"How come you say you will and then you won't
you change your mind and then you say you don't
The mystery is why I play the goat
the mystery you call love

Sometimes you're like an eagle strong like a rock
other times it seems you get unlocked
And all your worst fears come tumbling out
into the street, into the snow

I remember when you had a dream
everything was what it seemed to be
But now nightmares replace everything
and everything you see is wrong

You said we'd meet but you're two hours late
you said you thought someone had picked your gate
So you hid and were afraid to wait
seeing shadows in the snow
Seeing shadows in the snow

one minute down next time rejoice, he seems -

Lou Reed,"Paralyzed by hatred and a piss ugly soul
If he murdered his father, he thought he'd become whole
While listening at night to an old radio
Where they danced to the rock minuet

In the gay bars in the back of the bar
He consummated hatred on a cold sawdust floor
While the jukebox played backbeats, he sniffed coke off a jar
While they danced to a rock minuet

School was a waste, he was meant for the street
But school was the only way, the army could be beat
The two whores sucked his nipples 'til he came on their feet
As they danced to the rock minuet

He dreamt that his father was sunk to his knees
His leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
And the studs from his jacket were as cold as a breeze
As he danced to a rock minuet

He pictured the bedroom where he heard the first cry
His mother on all fours, ah, with his father behind
And her yell hurt so much, he had wished he'd gone blind
And rocked to a rock minuet

In the back of the warehouse were a couple of guys
They had tied someone up and sewn up their eyes
And he got so excited he came on his thighs
When they danced to the rock minuet

On avenue be, someone cruised him one night
He took him in an alley and then pulled a knife
And thought of his father, as he cut his windpipe
And finally danced to the rock minuet

In the curse of the alley, the thrill of the street
On the bitter cold docks where the outlaws all meet
In euphoria drug in euphoria heat
You could dance to the rock minuet

In the thrill of the needle and anonymous sex
You could dance to the rock minuet

So when you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance to the rock minuet

Lou Reed,"Some couples live in harmony
Some do not
Some couples yell and scream
Some do not

But what you said was something
That I can't forget
It echoes in my head
Like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream
And some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
And some do not

Some people wait for sleep
To take them away
While others read books endlessly
Hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything
Works out
Neither one of us is
The type who shouts

You sleep in the bedroom
While I pace up and down the hall

Wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not
Every match burns bright
I guess it's true
Not all that I say is right

But what you said still bounces
Around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
When we first went to bed

I'm told in the end
That none of this matters
All couples have troubles
And none of this matters

But what you said
Still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
Downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care
But here's my last thought
Not that it matters
But here's the last thing I thought

Our little thing is lying
Here in tatters
And you my dear
Don't have any manners

Sad to leave this way
To leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way
To leave it all in tatters

That nothing of it matters
Still it's sad
To see everything in tatters",Tatters,2000
Lou Reed,"There's a white prism with phony jism
Spread across its face
And the soulful convicts forever interred
Lose the smile across their faces
The smile that registered hopes or dreams

And I'm the indentured servant
Forever in his place
I'm the indentured servant
Forever in his place

I wish I built a cabinet
Of shiny bolts and wood
Secret draws and hiding places
Sculpted out of wood
Secret places, secret lies
In a desk lying alone

A secret letter written to you
To be read when you're alone
A secret letter written to you
To be read when you're alone

It says I'm your indentured servant
I can no longer pretend
That I'm a lover or an equal
I'm not even a friend
I'm not good enough to serve you
I'm not good enough to stay

So it is that I beseech you
To please turn me away
So it is that I beseech you
To please turn me away

Turn me away
Turn me away

Crouched beneath your dress I come
Shooting little spurts
Crouched beneath your dress I come
Shooting little spurts

I'm your indentured servant
But even I have pride
In what I make or say or do
Although I've lots to hide
I hide from freedom and I hide from you
'cause you've found me out

I belong in prison beneath your legs
In a cabinet that I've built
Beneath a candle in a secret drawer
In a prison by a moat

I'm your indentured servant
And I'm asking you to leave
Me outside this prison cell
Where only you can breathe
I'm your indentured servant
But I'm asking you for this

Please release me from this love
And do it with a kiss

Suitcase in my hand.

Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.

The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Lou Reed,"

Oh, say, can you see

by the dawn's early light

What so proudly we hailed

at the twilight's last gleaming

Whose broad stripes and bright stars

through the perilous fight

O'er the ramparts we watched were so

gallantly streaming


America, America

America

America, America

America


And the rockets' red glare

the bombs bursting in air

Gave proof through the night

that our flag was still there

Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave

O'er the land of the free

and the home of the brave

Lou Reed,"When you pass through the fire, you pass through humble
you pass through a maze of self doubt
When you pass through humble, the lights can blind you
some people never figure that out

You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
you pass through an ever present past
And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
pass through the fire to the light

Pass through the fire to the light
pass through the fire to the light
It's best not to wait for luck to save you
pass through the fire to the light

As you pass through the fire, your right hand waving
there are things you have to throw out
That caustic dread inside your head
will never help you out

You have to be very strong, 'cause you'll start from zero
over and over again
And as the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
lying straight ahead

Lying straight ahead
lying straight ahead
As the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
lying straight ahead

They say no one person can do it all
but you want to in your head
But you can't be Shakespeare and you can't be Joyce
so what is left instead

You're stuck with yourself and a rage that can hurt you
you have to start at the beginning again
And just this moment this wonderful fire
started up again

When you pass through humble, when you pass through sickly
when you pass through I'm better than you all
When you pass through anger and self deprecation
and have the strength to acknowledge it all

When the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic
that let you survive your own war
You find that that fire is passion
and there's a door up ahead not a wall

As you pass through fire as you pass through fire
trying to remember its name
When you pass through fire licking at your lips
you cannot remain the same

And if the building's burning move towards that door
but don't put the flames out
There's a bit of magic in everything
and then some loss to even things out

Some loss to even things out
some loss to even things out
There's a bit of magic in everything
and then some loss to even things out

Lou Reed,"Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

I hold a mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
A passion that breaks reason in two

I, I, I have to think and I have to think and stop me now
If reminisces make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality

I wonder who started all this
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed?
And God, less love, sent us away?

Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees, who made the sky?
Who made the storms, who made heartbreak?
I wonder how much life I can take

I see at last a future self
Were you alive, I'd ask your help
But thinking puts me in a daze
And thinking never helped me anyway

You always were so negative
You never saw the positive
You always stand upon the edge
And dream of what it must be to be dead

I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body and be free

You'd like to float like a mystic child
You'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
You'd love to solve the mystery of live
By cutting someone's throat or removing their heart

You'd like to see it beat
You'd like to hold your eyes
And though you know I'm dead
You'd like to hold my thighs

If it's wrong to think on this
To hold the dead past, to hold the dead past in your fist
Why were we, why were we given memories?
Let's lose our minds, be set free

Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

I wonder, I wonder who started all this, oh
Was God in love and, was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed?
And God less love sent us away

To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away

Lou Reed,"Once upon a midnight dreary
As I pondered, weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping
Rapping at my chamber door
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered
""Tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more.""

Muttering I got up weakly
Always I've had trouble sleeping
Stumbling upright my mind racing
Furtive thoughts flowing once more
I, there hoping for some sunrise
Happiness would be a surprise
Loneliness no longer a prize
Rapping at my chamber door
Seeking out the clever bore
Lost in dreams forever more
Only this and nothing more

Hovering my pulse was racing
Stale tobacco my lips tasting
Scotch sitting upon my basin
Remnants of the night before
Came again
Infernal tapping on the door
In my mind jabbing
Is it in or outside rapping
Calling out to me once more
The fit and fury of Lenore
Nameless here forever more

And the silken sad uncertain
Rustling of the purple curtain
Thrilled me, filled me
With fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now, oh wind, stood breathing
Hoping yet to calm my breathing
""'Tis some visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
Some lost visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
This it is, and nothing more.""

Deep into the darkness peering
Long I stood there
Wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming fantasies
No mortal dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken
And the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered name, ""Lenore.""
This I thought
And out loud whispered from my lips
The foul name festered
Echoing itself
Merely this, and nothing more

Back into my chamber turning
Every nerve within me burning
When once again I heard a tapping
Somewhat louder than before
""surely,"" said I
Surely that is something at my iron staircase
Open the door to see what threat is
Open the window, free the shutters
Let us this mystery explore
Oh, bursting heart be still this once
And let this mystery explore
It is the wind and nothing more

Just one epithet I muttered as inside
I gagged and shuddered
When with manly flirt and flutter
In there flew a stately raven
Sleek and ravenous as any foe
Not the least obeisance made he
Not a minutes gesture towards me
Of recognition or politeness
But perched above my chamber door
This fowl and salivating visage
Insinuating with its knowledge
Perched above my chamber door
Silent sat and staring
Nothing more

Askance, askew
The self's sad fancy smiles at you I swear
At this savage viscous countenance it wears
Though you show here shorn and shaven
And I admit myself forlorn and craven
Ghastly grim and ancient raven
Wandering from the opiate shores
Tell me what thy lordly name is
That you are not nightmare sewage
Some dire powder drink or inhalation
Framed from flames of downtown lore
Quotes the raven, ""nevermore.""

And the raven sitting lonely
Staring sickly at my male sex only
That one word
As if his soul in that one word
He did outpour, ""pathetic.""
Nothing farther than he uttered
Not a feather then he fluttered
Till finally was I that muttered as I stared
Dully at the floor
""other friends have flown and left me
Flown as each and every hope has flown before
As you no doubt will fore the morrow.""
But the bird said, ""never, more.""

Then I felt the air grow denser
Perfumed from some unseen incense
As though accepting angelic intrusion
When in fact I felt collusion
Before the guise of false memories respite
Respite through the haze of cocaine's glory
I smoke and smoke the blue vial's glory
To forget
At once
The base Lenore
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

""Prophet,"" said I, ""thing of evil
Prophet still, if bird or devil
By that heaven that bend above us
By that God we both ignore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
Willful and destructive intent
How had lapsed a pure heart lady
To the greediest of needs
Sweaty arrogant dickless liar
Who ascribed to nothing higher
Than a jab from prick to needle
Straight to betrayal and disgrace
The conscience showing not a trace.""
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

""Be that word our sign of parting
Bird or fiend,"" I yelled upstarting
""get thee back into the tempest
Into the smoke filled bottle's shore
Leave no black plume as a token
Of the slime thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken
Quit as those have quit before
Take the talon from my heart
And see that I can care no more
Whatever mattered came before
I vanish with the dead Lenore.""
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

But the raven, never flitting
Still is sitting silent sitting
Above a painting silent painting
Of the forever silenced whore
And his eyes have all the seeming
Of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamplight over him
Streaming throws his shadow to the floor
I love she who hates me more
I love she who hates me more
And my soul shall not be lifted from that shadow

Coming down in gems

Though gorgeous clouds fly

With a young lady on your arm
Looking for a kiss
I want to Know (Pit and Pendulum)
Young Poe 

Young Poe: 

Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes I have felt the full knowledge and force of their expression and yet been unable to possess it and have felt it leave me as so many other things have left, the letter half read the bottle half drunk finding in the commonest objects of the universe a circle of analogies, of metaphors for that expression which has been willfully withheld from me, the access to the inner soul denied. 

Judges (Choir): I want to know 

Young Poe:

In consideration of the faculties and impulses of the human soul in consideration of our arrogance our radical, primitive irreducible arrogance of reason we have all overlooked the propensity. We saw no need for it, the paradoxical something which we may call perverseness. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object.

We act for the reason we should not. For certain minds this is absolutely irresistible. The conviction of the wrong or impolicy of an action is often the unconquerable force. It is a primitive impulse. The overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake. We persist in acts because we feel that we should not persist in them.

Judges and the dead people (Choir): I want to know",Vanishing Act,2003
Lou Reed,"Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I hold a mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
A passion that breaks reason in two
I, I, I have to think and, I have to think and stop me now
If reminisces make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality
I wonder who started all this
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away?
Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees,who made the sky
Who made the storms, who made heartbreak?
I wonder how much life I can take
I see at last a future self
Were you alive I'd ask your help
But thinking puts me in a daze
And thinking never helped me anyway
You always were so negative
You never saw the positive
You always stand upon the edge
And dream of what it must be to be dead
I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body - and be free
You'd like to float like a mystic child
You'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
You'd love to solve the mystery of live
By cutting someone's throat or removing their heart
You'd like to see it beat
You'd like to hold your eyes
And though you know I'm dead
You'd like to hold my thighs
If it's wrong to think on this
To hold the dead past, to hold the dead past in your fist
Why were we, why were we given memories?
Let's lose our minds
Be set free!
Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I wonder
I wonder who started all this - ooh
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away",Who Am I? (Tripitena's Song),2003

Lou Reed,"The myriad choices of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate
For him to choose
What had he to lose

Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of g.t.

The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell

Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again

Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again

And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on

If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose, if you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start

Start the game i che che che che i
Che che ka tak koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go",The Black Angel's Death Song,2004
Lou Reed,"Empty, empty bottles
Lying side by side
Used up empty bottles
Remembering long lost wine

Keep our empty bottles
Making empty wine
Marking our intentions
Sadly out of time

And the summer make you lazy
A day at a time
And good company evades you
Passing you by

But I do love you against all odds
Though you don't know what I want
We're much poorer than that bottle
More foolish than that wine

Maybe we can make it
Though we failed before
You keep getting closer
Closer to me once more

And I'll try to entertain you
A day at a time
Try to make myself much clearer
From your wine

But I do love you against all odds
Though you don't know what I want
Seeing you and seeing me
We're much poorer than that bottle
More foolish than that wine

Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.

The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

And look me in the eye

Your weakness buys indifference
And indiscretion in the streets
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not

Wedding bells they begin easy
Live it down, baby don't talk that much,

Drowned in the dark or we could go sailing
On the sea

Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love or was it just easy
Money talks when people need shoes and socks,
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me

I was just sipping on something sweet
I don?t need political process

I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more
See I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And it don't stop dragging me down

And sometimes I'm a travel man

Steal a car and ring a round-rosy,

Run away and give me your sneakers

A hurried high from pestilence pills and pride,
It's a shame, we could have gone sailing

Cause I don't care where you've been
And I don't care what you've seen

There was nothin' goin' down at all

And she couldn't believe what she heard at all

Ahh, her life was saved by rock 'n' roll

And those stews that lasted three days into four

The weird eerie light at a quarter past one, 
And I knew in my head as I lay in my bed 
That you'd stay in my heart til the day I was dead, 
We killed each other and loved in time, 
And laughed til we almost cried, 
Yeah we cried as well when it all went to Hell, 
And my heart it broke til I swear it died

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
I had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a slut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
Till I thought of what I'd say
And which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
Hey, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home 

Take back home, grab your things
When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette?
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
Hey, I said, keep my things I've come to take me home

Lou Reed,"When you pass through the fire, you pass through humble
You pass through a maze of self doubt
When you pass through humble, the lights can blind you
Some people never figure that out

You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
You pass through an ever present past
And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
Pass through the fire to the light

Pass through the fire to the light
Pass through the fire to the light
It's best not to wait for luck to save you
Pass through the fire to the light

As you pass through the fire, your right hand waving
There are things you have to throw out
That caustic dread inside your head will never help you out
You have to be very strong 'cause you'll start from zero
over and over again
And as the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
Lying straight ahead

Lying straight ahead
Lying straight ahead
As the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
Lying straight ahead

They say no one person can do it all
But you want to in your head
But you can't be Shakespeare and you can't be Joyce
So what is left instead

You're stuck with yourself and a rage that can hurt you
You have to start at the beginning again
And just this moment
This wonderful fire started up again

When you pass through humble, when you pass through sickly
When you pass through, I'm better than you all
When you pass through anger and self deprecation
And have the strength to acknowledge it all

When the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic
That let you survive your own war
You find that that fire is passion
And there's a door up ahead, not a wall

As you pass through fire, as you pass through fire
Trying to remember its name
When you pass through fire licking at your lips
You cannot remain the same

And if the building's burning, move towards that door
But don't put the flames out
There's a bit of magic in everything
And then some loss to even things out

Some loss to even things out
Some loss to even things out

Lou Reed,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,2017
Lou Reed,"A couple of years back I come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio.  And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he had written, I saw that he was about a step away from dying, and I couldn't help but wonder why.  And the lines of this song occurred to me.  I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted, and he's got him a good woman.  And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped showed me how to beat the devil.

It was wintertime in Nashville
Down on Music City Row
And I was looking for a place
And to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whiskey
But my hunger needed beans
But it had been a month of paydays
Since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty
And a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually I'd guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling
And sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
I saw that there was just one old man sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
And he turned and said,
Come up here, boy, and show us what you are
I said I'm dry, and he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said,
It's a tough life, ain't it?
I just looked at him
He said, you ain't making any money, are you?
I said, you been reading my mail
He just smiled and said, let me see that guitar
I got something you ought to hear
And then he laid it on me

If you waste your time a talking 
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying
Who do you thinks gonna hear?
And if you should die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Who do you thinks gonna care?
There were other lonely singers
In a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
‘Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know

Well the old man was a stranger
But I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out
On the wrong side of the door
When no one stood behind me
But my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't want to join him
You gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil
But I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song

And you still can hear me singing
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying
Praying someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Hoping someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer
And I'm bound to die the same
But I've gotta feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel
I won't ever die ashamed
‘Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know",To Beat the Devil,2017

Whether blue or gray be her skies.
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize:

I love Paris in the fall.

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old

We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road
I'm hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the guard feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want

Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
Listen, I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary

It's only customary to give this commentary

Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date",Roxanne Roxanne (The New Chapter),2014

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003

From the finest thing a nigga could imagine
Like a dream inside a vision of a potion
Of a dope wish of a vision son it's happening
I had to pull up to her in the shiny fashion
She had the purple eyes with the blue lashes
I was sinking in that thing like two oceans
On the quest to get next to her - I had devotion
She would hit me at the stoop when I was cooking
In a secret little picture good looking
My imagination is springing into action
Her voice was like a sunny sea of unsatisfied (-ness)
It was Gucci when she put me on detention (it was gucci)
We would watch a show or two and then get it in
As I think about her now her I'm thinking cinnamon
She could barely fit her panties - she was skinny though

Loudermilk,"The sun wakes me on devil's morning 
His arms stretched over the town to make a red sky 
Month of Juliet and you are gorgeous, the dust you ingest you die 
Broke my link my ideal now their eyes 
Like their lies move on quick like a suicide 
Summer prays that she could be rain 
As the car crash left you for the blame 
And nightfall brought your daemons and evil arkaide 
She is the famine, I'm California 
He is Dakota, I'm California 
There can't be lying in California 
Left like the west, I am California 
The sunset was the devil's warning 
His siren was louder than love and it sounds so pretty relieved that you fell 
Like the leaves of a cherry tree 
Something born in my brain bleeding silver and rain lives a will that can't ever change 
And nightfall was a shock so you closed your eyes, a fever breaks out through the line 
And I'm gone 'cause I felt the curse of the sun 
You left your sweetheart in California... 
He is beautiful and a whore and he'll die with you on the floor 
Sounds like sugar into your ear and his spiderweb caught your tear 
I noticed he's writing his name in your hand

Loudhouse,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Loudon Wainwright III,"Little did I know, though I probably should have guessed
By the way you walked and talked and spoke and smoked an dressed
You actually seemed to like me and so naturally I presumed
You were after that thing, it's the one thing, it's assumed

So I wined and dined you, hey, I love that kind of stuff
And we blabbed about our backgrounds, how family life is rough
We spoke of what we dreamed of, what we thought of, what we did
Midway through the second bottle I admitted I had kids

But nothing seemed to throw you though I know you better now
At the time my minor crime was figuring out how
To get you in my hotel room unclothed and in my bed
And proceed with the unspeakable, it's better left unsaid

We went to see a friend of your and watch me on TV 
Sheer coincidence you said, synchronicity
A full moon on a Friday night, the thirteenth of July
A man and two women in a room and on the screen the guy

Your friend, she liked me on the show, yeah she was snowed for sure
Her body language got obscene, her demeanor less than pure
You started venting something wearing spleen upon your sleeve
You got sort of nervous, kind of anxious, had to leave

You told me on the freeway that you didn't sleep with men
I put two and two togetherâ?¦and I asked about your friend
It turns out she    and though she loved my show
She too preferred the fairer sexâ??I absorbed the blow

It turns out that you did like men but didn't like their things

Pictures of the family,
Mostly my kids but there's an old
Picture of you and me.
You were five and I was six
In 1952
That was forty years ago
How could it be true?

We were sitting outside drawing
At a table meant for cards,
And it must have been in autumn,
Falling leaves in the front yard,
With a shoe box full of crayons,
Full of colors oh so bright,
In a picture in a plastic frame,
A snapshot black and white.

You were looking at my paper,
Watching what I drew
It was natural: I was older,
Thirteen months more than you.
A brother and a sister,
A little boy and girl,
And whoever took that picture
Captured our own world.

A brother needs a sister
To watch what he can do,
To protect and to torture,
To boss around—it's true
But a brother will defend her
For a sister's love is pure,
Because she thinks he's wonderful
When he is not so sure.

In the picture there's a fender
Of our old Chevrolet
Or Pontiac—our dad would know,
Surely he could say
But dad is dead and we grow old
It's true that time flies by
And in forty years the world has changed
As well as you and I.",Picture,1992

Today is your birthday if I'm not wrong
If I'm not mistaken, you're 50 today
How are you doin', Bob? What do you say?

Well, it musta been about '62
I heard you on record, you were brand new
And some had some doubts about the way you sang
But the truth came through and loudly it rang

Yeah, you were hipper than Mitch Miller
And Johnny Mathis put together

So I got some boots, a harmonica rack
A D-21, and I was on the right track
But I didn't start writing until '68
It was too damn daunting, you were too great
I won a whole lot of Bob Dylan imitation contests, though, huh

Yeah, times were a changin', you brought it all home
'Blonde On Blonde', 'Like A Rolling Stone'
The real world is crazy, you were deranged
And when you went electric, Bob, everything changed
A shock to the system

Had a commission at her motorcycle wreck
Holed up in Woodstock with a broken neck
And the labels were signin' up guys with guitars
Out to make millions, lookin' for stars

Well, I figured it was time to make my move
Songs from the West Chester County Delta country

Yeah, I got a deal and so did John Prine
Steve Forbert and Springsteen, all in a line
They were lookin' for you, signin' up others
We were new Bob Dylans, your dumb ass kid brothers

Well, we still get together every week at Bruce's house
Why, he's got quite a spread I tell ya, it's a twelve step program

Yeah, but we were just us and of course you were you
And ""John Wesley Harding"" sure sounded new
And then, ""Nashville Skyline"" was even newer
'Blood On the Tracks' an' the ringin' got truer

Let's see, there was another one in there somewhere[Incomprehensible]
Oh, I got it, I got it, ""Self Portrait""
Well, it was an interesting effort

Yeah, had to stop listening, times were too tough
Me bein' the new me was hard enough
You keep right on changin' like you always do
An' what's best is the old stuff still all sounds new

Yeah, today is your birthday, have a great one, Bob
Bein' the new you is one hell of a job
My kid cranked up her boom box to almost grown
When I heard you screamin' from her room
""Everybody must get stoned"", thanks a lot, Bob
Happy birthday, Bob

And the mind begins to wander back
to happier days.

I guess you'd say you were taken for granted
I went on and on and I raved and I ranted,oh--
My tyrannical ways.

Bridge 1
But now things are different,
Cause now you are gone,
I'm not so sure
I can carry on.

Always knew you were important to me
But now I know you are a necessity, otherwise--
I start to go insane.

Things weren't easy when we were together,
We had plenty of days of lousy weather
I'm in a hurricane.


Bridge 2
I'm gonna grieve,
I'm gonna moan.
Cause you're not here,
I'm all alone.

The joke's on me
You get the last laugh
I found out the hard way you was my better half, and now-
I'm the worse for the wear.

On Valentine's Day expect a valentine
Cause now I know
How much I care.

Loudon Wainwright III,"For twenty odd years I have strummed on guitars
Five thousand lost flat picks, four fingertip scars
I must have broken a million g strings
Picking and strumming, and playing these things
Banging and tunin', and playing these things.

And it's been sixteen years now that I've written songs
Over a hundred and still growing strong
About drinking and hockey and flying above
Again and again about unhappy love
Over and over, unhappy love.

And it's music for money, but I'll do it for fun
Oh, I know how to do it, it's easily done
To stand on a stage doesn't make me afraid
I'm comfortable up there, it's gotten me laid
It always amazes me when I get paid.

So here am I doing all that I can do
You're paying, I'm playing, I'm grateful to you

You're not really dead.

On a telephone;
From a bunker beneath Graceland,
The king sits on his throne.

Happy birthday, Elvis;
Fifty-eight years old today.
It isn't true, you didn't die,
No matter what they say.
The colonel just decided
You should drop out of sight
After the Bicentennial
The timing was just right.

Happy birthday, Elvis;
You're alive in '93.
They took away the body,
But who the hell was he?
Who was that tall fat man
They buried in your place?
Just another imitator;
Plastic surgeons did his face.

Happy birthday, Elvis;
You still love to ball.
Somebody said she spotted you
In a Memphis mall.
Check out the checkout counters;
Read what the tabloids say:
Aliens abducted you,
But somehow you got away.

Happy birthday, Elvis;
I for one will not shed tears.
You'll be back for the millennium;
That's in seven measly years.

Loudon Wainwright III,"There once was a man who just couldn't cry
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies and the movie love story
For instance could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point his tear ducts ran dry
He grew to be a man, the feces hit the fan
Things got bad, but he couldn't cry

His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
And after that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but sill not a sniffle or sob

His novel was refused, his movie was panned
And his big Broadway show was a flop

He got sent off to jail; you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop

In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
But not once did a tear stain his face

Doctors were called in, scientists, too
Theologians were last and practically least

They all agreed sure enough; this was sure no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast

He was removed from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He played lots of chess and made lots of friends
And he wept every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried

On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died

Well, he went up to heaven, located his dog
Not only that, but he rejoined his arm
Down below, all the critics, they loot it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out

Right down to the ground, that old jail house burned down
The earth suffered perpetual drought",The Man Who Couldn't Cry,1993

Right after Hallowe'en
Forget about Thanksgiving
It's just a buffet in between.

They're stocking up the shelves.

In his sweatshop full of elves.

There's got to be a build-up 
To the day that Christ was born.
The halls are decked with pumpkins
And ears of Indian corn.

In a one-horse open sleigh.

What have we wrought?
Give a listen here, what do we dig?

I prefer ah or er
You can rest assured
If you're sayin what you mean then it don't mean a thing

And the fire goes out

When losses and wounds
Are grievous and gory
When the battle is pitched
In the field there is glory
When hearts just aren't in it
Retreat leads to rout
And then arms are laid down
And the fire goes out

Loudon Wainwright III,"Living on the side 
Of Primrose Hill
Drinking cans of Tennants 
Just can't seem to get my fill
Got a beat up guitar 
And a dirty old sleeping bag
And this mangy dog 
Whose tail don't wag
Sun's been shining down
On my hillside bed
That's not the only reason
My face is so red
This nasty cut on my nose
Is not from no fight
I just fell down yesterday
Or maybe it was last night
And I used to sing and play
Down in the underground
But a few years back 
They started cracking down
Now I'm living on the side
Of Primrose Hill
I'm no tourist attraction
But I give them a thrill

Yeah I see you 
Riding by on your flash bicycle
Yeah they can do you for that on Primrose Hill
A pretty young mother goes by
She's pushing her pram
Her little baby leans out
Just to see what I am
From the top of the hill
There's a hell of a view
Houses of Parliament and London Zoo
Those politicians all chatter
They trumpet and roar
That must be what those hyenas all
Are laughing for
When you come up to London
It sure is something to see
It's somewhere to go
But it's no place to be
And there's two things 
Keeping me from going 'round the bend
I got my music 
And this dog for a friend

'Cause life gets slippery
When you're living on the side
Yeah I know I should quit drinking
But I haven't even tried
My mutt's licking my fingers
And I'm wetting my lips
I got a can of extra strong
And a bag of chicken and chips
If I had a little money
I'd get a few things
Like a bottle of vodka
And a pack of new guitar strings
I guess I could die here
On the side of this hill
I'm no tourist attraction
But I'd give them a chill
And I'm living on the side
Of Primrose Hill
Drinking cans of Tennants
Just can't seem to get my fill

Loudon Wainwright III,"The sad thing is I'm so damn happy
Who'd blame her if she were to slap me
The sun should not shine when there's rain
I should be in a lot more pain
At least I should feel slightly crappy
But the sad thing is I'm so damn happy

And the worst thing is it's so much better
That admission would upset her
But it's true and it's beyond belief
What I feel is sheer relief
I may regret the day I met her
And the worst thing is it's so much better

It's comic that it's all so tragic
It's that hum-drum novel old black magic
Let's have a laugh after we cry
Let's hope we live before we die
The silly clown's red nose is runny
And it's tragic that it's all so funny

It's crucial that it doesn't matter
Vows of love are idle chatter
To feel this good has to be bad

And the sad thing is I'm so damn happy
Yes the sad thing is I'm so damn happy",So Damn Happy,1998
Loudon Wainwright III,"Here's a song
For someone else to sing
With a universal
And generic ring

It's all about the same old stuff
That you like and can't get enough of
How's about a minor chord right here
Wasn't that rather pleasant in your ear?

And here's a song with not a lot to say
But when you see it it'll sound okay
You bet there'll be a video
We'll flesh it out for radio
Now it's high time that I play that change again
It's haunting you like an annoying friend

It's true that you like what you get
You get what you're given
God knows what the hell you'll like
That's why he's up in heaven

Here's a song I didn't even write
It came to me one rainy April night
I had been drinking I was bored
Next to me our fat gray cat snored
I'm afraid it's time for you know what
The cat's awake, I fear I woke him up
So that's enough of that 
Now I'll shut up
",A Song,1998
Loudon Wainwright III,"You know when I know just how much I care
When I'm carefully folding your clean underwear
I see it's all worth it though sometimes it sure hurts
Putting back in the bureau drawer all my t-shirts
I find the foundation, the reason, a basis
Stuffing the pillows back into their cases

We suffer slings, withstand buffets and shocks
It's so clear separating then mating the socks
Stretching the fitted sheet onto the bed
I recall hairs we've split, blood and tears that we've shed
But love feels secure dear somehow I discover
Slipping the duvet into its warm cover
",Underwear,1998
Loudon Wainwright III,"Your mother's loose, your father's slim
She smothers you, you bother him

Passed back and forth between those two
Until they've had enough of you

But by this time something's gone wrong

Awake all night deprived of sleep
It's overload they're in too deep then...

She forgets to take a pill
Overload is overkill
What... what are families for?

He's at the wheel, she's at his side
Three kids in back out for a ride

Looking at houses, autumn leaves
Keep hope alive, try to believe

They haven't made a huge mistake
And what seemed real in fact is fake

Kids can't sit still, ""are we there yet?""
He lights his seventh cigarette

""Almost,"" she says, ""it won't be long
Look out the window, sing a song""
Singing what... what are families for?

You're the brother who is big
You were your parents' guinea pig

The first, the oldest and the best
Smarter, quicker than the rest

Your little sister's just a girl
So you can kick her from your world

You push your baby brother down
And grind his face into the ground

They do what you want them to 
Because those two look up to you
What... what are families for?

Finally you leave the nest
Life was a quiz, now it's a test

You can't just live, a living's earned
So you use every trick you've learned

You cast off siblings, you make friends
Discover the receiving end

You swore you'd never be a dad
But that's what works, isn't that sad?

Young women want to mother you
You hate it but you want them to
What... what are families for?

All grown up, holding your own
You fend them off by telephone

You keep in touch, it's come to this
The furtive hug, suspicious kiss

Your sister's ensconced in your life
The archetype of an an ex-wife

For all that dirt he ate back then
Your brother figures you owe him now

Mom wants back all that Dad took
But Dad is dead, he's off the hook
What... what are families for?

From bottom to top and pole to pole

You think you're Superman
Sure you can handle it

If wishes were horses maybe
It's just a song Louis' coming on strong again
We ache for fantasy

And there's no way to fix it, it's broke

I flipped a switch and the light went on
I got out of bed and I put some clothes on

I turned the tap, there was cold there was hot
I put on my coat to go to the shop
I stepped outside, and I didn't get shot
It's a pretty good day so far

I didn't hear any sirens or explosions
No murders coming in form those heavy guns
No UN tanks, I didn't see one
It's a pretty good day so far

No snipers in windows, taking a peak
No people panic, running scared through the streets
I didn't see any bodies without arms, legs, or feet
It's a pretty good day

There was plasma bandages and electricity
Food, wood, and water; and the air was smoke free
No camera crews from my TV
It was all such a strange sight to be home

Nobody was frightened, wounded, hungry, or cold
And the children seemed normal, they didn't look old
It's a pretty good day so far
I walked through a park, you would not believe it

There in the park, there were a few trees left
And on some branches, there were a few leaves

And the place is quite lonely around,
And I know that the smiles and the forms I have seen
Now lie in the cold mossy ground.

Where my children used to play at the door,
Where they pulled the white blossoms that garnished the
earth,

Just that you have survived ? nobody is sure exactly why
Everybody has to die
Still it comes this ? know you got to go
And the world is gonna pass you by
I am older than my old man
I am older than my old man ever was

I am older than my old man ever was
I am guilty to outlive my ex",Older Than My Old Man Now,2012
Loudon Wainwright III,"Do we ever want to take the low road?
Do we ever just want to say we're through?
Do we want to lock the door and throw away the key?
Do we? We do

Do we want to just look on the dark side?
Do we want to wallow in the mire?
Do we want to feel the world's against us?
Do we? Yes we do

Do we think it's sometimes just a nuisance
And other times a travesty to all
Who've tried but only fallen to ruins
With their broken backs up against the wall

Do we want to say it's just a fool's game
That no one but the wickedest can win?
And do we want to play it with our last dime?
Oh do we? We do

Do we wanna say that things are changing?
Do We? We Do lyrics on ChiaSeNhac.com
And they're only changing for the worse?
And do we want to drink while the ship's sinking?
Singing our lord's praises like a curse

Do we want the enemy's misfortunes
To rain down like a million rotten eggs?
Down upon the crown of creation?
Do we? We do",Do We? We Do,2014
Louie,"Les poissons, les poissons
How I love les poissons
Love to chop and to serve little fish
First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones
Ah mais oui, ça c'est toujours delice

Les poissons, les poissons
Hee hee hee, haw haw haw
With a cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
God, I love little fishes, don't you?

Here's something for tempting the palette
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
Then you slash off their skin
Give their belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause it makes it taste nice

Zut alors, I have missed one!

Sacre bleu, what is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel dommage, what a loss
Here we go, in the sauce
Now some flour I think just a dab
Now I stuff you with bread
Don't worry, 'cause you're dead
And you're certainly lucky you are
'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot
Toodle-oo mon poisson
Au revoir!",Les Poissons,1988

That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me

That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1954
Louie Bellson,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-apats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating Rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.
Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
O find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

Oh, won't you stop picking on me?",Fascinatin' Rhythm,1955

Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [Unedited Version][#],1970
Louie Bellson,"There was a day, there was a time
When I used to play
There was a time when I used to play
But take me now, baby, don't worry about later
Teach the dance I used to do
They call it the Mashed Potato

There was a day, now dig this
There was a day, they call it the Jerk
Everybody relax and watch me work

In my hometown where I used to stay
The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together in time, for rhythm with you
So come and walk

There was a day that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler
I do the best that I can do

There was a time, sometimes I dance
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet
Until you see me do the James Brown",There Was a Time [#],1970
Louie Bellson,"Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come, no baby, the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down, hey baby, like falling rain
Till now, you don't around and call my name
The way I think, you gotta walk the floor, way, way I do, baby
Your cheatin' heart, yeah, will tell on you, babe

When, when tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around, you call my name
You'll walk the floor baby, the way I do
Your cheatin' heart, will tell on you",Your Cheatin' Heart,1970
Louie Bellson,"Open your window and take a deep sigh
Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite

Takin' it easy is easy as pie
And holdin' your hand is such a natural high
You sent flowers, we spent hours
We can be happy alone in a tent

Think of the money we'd save on rent
You sent flowers, we spent hours
We can be happy alone in a tent
Just think of the money we'd save on rent

If you just open your window and take a deep sigh
And holdin' your hand is such a natural high

",Open Your Window,1975
Louie Bellson,"I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

[Chorus]
Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

[Chorus]",(Back Home Again In) Indiana,1975
Louie Bellson,"Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo,
In a garden fair where roses grow,
In the tender light
Of a Summer night,
I can see her wander to and fro.

For she said, ""I'll wait
By the garden gate"",
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",
And in all my dreams it seems I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.

Oh, she said she's gonna wait
Down by the garden gate,
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",
And in all my dreams it seems that I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.",On the Alamo,1975
Louie Bellson,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love,1975
Louie Bellson,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,1978
Louie Bellson,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1978
Louie Bellson,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Louie Bellson,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Louie Bellson,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1990
Louie Bellson,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony

Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Because of you, darling
It's you, I hate to lose

Nobody loves me, nobody don't care
I don't believe they love me, nobody seems to care
Bad luck trouble, baby

I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Get my grip, my shoes and my hat

As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake

You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Louie Bellson & His Jazz Orchestra,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating Rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.
Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
O find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

Oh, won't you stop picking on me?",Fascinating Rhythm,1986

Screams he's better off dead.
Met a punk with a dis 
Wants a fight and now you're pissed
It's already too late
Sawed off your hate

What did you sell your soul for?
Was it a gun and a bullet and a chance at revenge?
You got props from your boys on the block, 
A cross to bear that never ends
What did you sink so low for?
Was it the time and the space and the spit in your face?
Props from the cops and the court
A sin you can't erase

He caught you looking his way
Hands in the air, what the hell'd ya say?
I know something sad but true

Paula dónde te has metido caramba, dónde te has ido a esconder 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Nueva York, Ciudad fría muéstrame tu corazón, di si está aquí en Manhattan o está allá en el Bronx 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Me paso la noche por la calle 82 a ver si la encuentro asomada al balcón 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
De buscar por el barrio me cansé, busca y busca y nunca la hallé 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Oye, pero que triste, pero que triste, triste, triste quedé cuando 
se fue Paula C 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Tristeza, vete muy lejos, para no perder la fe 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Pasé por Brasil y no la hallé, hay donde estará Paula C 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Busco de noche, busco de día, busco en la carta y adonde se iría 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Oye, pero que triste, pero que triste, triste, triste quedé cuando 
se fue Paula C 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Pero que vuelve nena, ven ven, pero que vuelve pronto, ya ya, anda Paula apúrate 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C

Louie Ramirez,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

Que es lo que en realidad soy para ti

Riding through my city with a chick I used to lust
Bout to make a movie starring me, the two of us
Penthouse at the top floor, elevator shooters up
So I can eat that pussy for breakfast, dinner, and lunch
And uh, she been waiting all night for this hard pipe
I think she called twice
Before you knew it I pulled in she seen them fog lights
And I can see it in her face she had a hard night
Up and down that pole selling dreams, selling love
It was sort of like she serving fiends and selling drugs
Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like
She be on that pole, tryna chase her goals
Going up and down like that angel on that Rolls. Lord Knows!

Shorty so pretty and that pussy so good
She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in the ass and she heard them pipes they was growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' leer in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder, ball horrible out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes
Hella Jewels, Money come in different revenues
Big Paper, your money smaller then that Kevin dude

I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?
I wanna buy your love, everything is on me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm really getting mad money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate
They call me racked up shorty, she can smell the Aura
Had her out in Bora exploring like she was Dora
Million dollar sponsor, spoiled her like my daughter

Started with them grams at the project with a stack
Then I flipped it to a brick and then I did the Project Pat
Like, homie what’s the problem?
Semi or revolve em
Catch a nigga with the bricks, you know we goin' rob em
Once I caught the lick we was fresh up out the drop
Man the bitches on the corner watch a player like the scout
I said all I wanted was a kilo
All them bitches wanna free load
All I wanted was a drop with the head cracked like Cee Lo

Louie Walikangas,"There's a van out in the drive
It's time to divide everything up
We've taken down the bed
Where so many nights we made love
We've gone through everything
And given back the rings
We once cherished
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you don't
But as for me

I'll take the memories
You can have the rest
I know we had some bad times
But our good times were the best
There's so many keepsakes
After all we've been through
But I'll take the memories
If I can't have you

I don't know just what I'll do
I've been so used to loving you
Such a long time
Even though I'll try
There's no way that I'll get you off my mind
So while we're packing up our lives
And saying our goodbyes, I want to tell you
You can take the things you want
And leave the things you want
And leave the things you don't

We be the B double O - T - C - A -M - P ( X3 )

I'm caught up in a zone of my own, I rome
Run my fingers through my hair and give air to my stoned dome
And analyse, who to tear through, I dare you
Devils that try to ban me that dare would be bare proof
Who's he? stalking the streets when there's no life
Eyes glow like tiko night glows, we's in flight
But it don't glow like, wack, the glow's phat
And it be the only glow that lemme know where a true warrior be at

Louieville, do he ill, snap in half your crew
Back, smack, a few of you till your ears ring
Duke I smack 'em with the bat. Why?
So my hands don't sting
I bring rec in this game, and don't shit change
I inflicts pain like a stressed brain having a migraine
Heads talk trash, walk in paths like anorexic
Patients, laced up, overdosed in the exits
And see, hears, these dumb, blind rappers
Who don't know the meaning of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
Many phrases, many ways you can explain this
Put on some rough, tough shit, huh, I'll make you famous
So, step don't stare, dare cross this path beware
Representativz and foul play out the rear (out the rear)

We see in the dark like an owl
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
Out to eliminate those who live foul
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl

Creep stalking, we, coughing
Burgling, make me wonder why I'm not sleep walking
Peeps talking, I hear 'em as I walk by, but they all die
I'm fortified with the 45
Fuck it! Let me proceed with the mission
No need for intermission, I need trees in my system
Cut down through mart, then I head for brisk in park
With my P 'n' C, for some yard to spark
No need to get hyper, I see, C, Cypher
Power on the corner fucking with my niggas, every hour
I devour, niggas who wanna test me and defy me
It might be Giuliani or the illuminati
But I be, writing plans of attack in my journal
So, Ruck, Rock, Ville Sluggah remains nocturnal
Seeing through sheisty shit, shining like I'm solar
Penetrate through darkness bounce like I'm sonar

CHORUS:
We been found less an organised ways to buckwild
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl
Spread the word, 29 million square miles
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl

One clik, stomping on the path, that's so hard
Ain't no smiling, we up against the odds like Phil Collins
Meanwhile, I still be wilding, but only smarter (what?)
Peep me the irrational and the quiet riot starter
Pardon this, I see you're not the sharpest pencil in the box
No where near a match, you get smashed by a Rock
I done seen 3 dollar bills and you faker
And you wonder why I hate ya
A snake'll get snatched by his tail, slammed on his head
Give me some panda thread (??) the cobra command the dead

Louis Armstrong,"When the moon's kinda dreamy
Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

When the wind through the window
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirsting
Till you feel like bursting
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes
Till somebody's found you
And put their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die

But when the Lord up above you
Send's someone to love you
The blues are something you loose
You're so busy doing
The things that you're doing
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues",The Blues Are Brewin',1947
Louis Armstrong,"Just dig that scenery floating by,
We're now approaching Newport, Rhode I.
We've been, for years, In Variety,
But, Cholly Knickerbocker, now we're going to be

In High, High So-
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

I want to play for my former pal-
He runs the local jazz festival.
His name is Dexter and he's good news,
But sumping kind of tells me that he's nursing the blues

In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

He's got the blues 'cause his wife, alas,
Thought writing songs was beneath his class,
But writing songs he'd not stop, of course,
And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce

In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

To make him sadder, his former wife
begins tomorrow a brand-new life.
She started lately a new affair
And now the silly chick is gonna marry a square

In High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

But, Brother Dexter, just trust your Satch,
To stop that wedding and kill that match.

And play in such a way that she'll come back to you, son,

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die

A black headed gal makes a freight train jump the track
But a long tall gal makes a preacher ball the jack

Lawd, a blonde headed woman makes a good man leave the town

But a red headed woman makes a boy slap his papa down""

Oh, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I said, ""Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
If my blues don't get you, my jazzing must""

Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby

Louis Armstrong,"A little jazz is just a bit of this and that
Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat
But most of all it's how you feel about the groove
And when it's groovin', how the groove makes you move

Jazz music sprouted rock and roll
It was the very first music that we call soul
Jazz is hot, it's cool, it's good, it's bad
And it can change your mood to happy from sad

Jazz is hip, it's groovy, it's fresh, it's jive
And when you play it, it makes your soul come alive
You know it's the upbeat rhythm that makes it bop
And once you get it started, well, it sure is hard to stop

No other music can compare
When the bass starts walkin', it fills the air
You know that the sass of brass has made it last
And it's the groove of blues from present to past

Hey, what about some of those great legends of jazz?
Yeah, like Jazz Royalty
Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Bassie
What about the great horn players?
Louis Armstrong, yeah, and Miles and Dizzy too

What about Yarnburn?
What, don't you mean Charlie Parker?
Yeah, this cool named Freddy Hubert

The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way

It's a lovely day

The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day

To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going
Leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke
They broke and, oh
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter-patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day",Isn't This a Lovely Day,1956
Louis Armstrong,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people i knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as i walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British museum, had lost its charm

How long i wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, i saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

He runs the local jazz festival.
His name is Dexter and he's good news,
But sumping kind of tells me that he's nursing the blues

In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

He's got the blues 'cause his wife, alas,
Thought writing songs was beneath his class,
But writing songs he'd not stop, of course,
And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce

In High, High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

To make him sadder, his former wife
begins tomorrow a brand-new life.
She started lately a new affair
And now the silly chick is gonna marry a square

In High So-,
High So-ci-,
High So-ci-ety.

But, Brother Dexter, just trust your Satch,
To stop that wedding and kill that match.

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?

That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane

Is my idea of nothing to do

And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see

His truth is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!

Not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy

Next you add some little ol' words on to it
Try to get some people who'll sing to do it
Then if they say, ?My have you got a hit?
You act non committal and say, ?Just a little ol' tune?

Now record your little ol' tune, just hum it
Could you try to fancy it up? Far from it

Just me, me, me, as you groove

Add a zoom, zoom, bass and then start the playback

Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Nor 'ardly no night
There's things 'alf in shadow
And 'alf way in light
On the roof tops of London
Coo, what a sight

I choose me bristles with pride
Yes, I do
A broom for the shaft
And a broom for the flume

Though I'm covered with soot
From me 'ead to me toes
A sweep knows 'e's welcome
Wherever 'e goes

I can see she longs for my returning
To my little cabin in the pines

Whispering breeze, whisper to my love
Tell her I'll come back some day
Say that I'm blue, broken-hearted too
Sorry that I went away

Down among the Carolines

Louis Armstrong,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,1988
Louis Armstrong,"Every morning memories stray 
Across the sea where flying fishes play 
And as the night is falling 
I find that I'm recalling 
That blissful all-enthralling day 
  
Just before I sailed away 
She said the word I longed to hear her say
I tenderly caressed her 
Close to my heart I pressed her 
Upon that golden yesterday 

I found my love in Avalon 
Beside the bay 
I left my love in Avalon and sailed away 
I dream of her and Avalon 
From dusk till dawn 
And so I think I'll travel on

And nobody's child
Haunting and taunting
You're just kind of wild

Can't seem to shake off
