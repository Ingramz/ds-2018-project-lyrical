Nigel Mack & the Blues Attack,"The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door",The Sky Is Crying,2001

'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

Nigel Planer,"Me and my baby, my baby and me
We're 'bout as happy as babies can be
What if I find that I'm caught in a storm?
I don't care my baby's there
And baby's bound to keep me warm

We're sticking together and ain't we got fun
So much together you'd count us as one
Tell old man worry to go climb a tree
'Cause I'm with my baby, I've got my baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
A dream of a duo now don't you agree
Why keep it mum when there's nothing to hide?
And what I feel I must reveal
It's more that I can keep inside

And I can assure you it won't go away
Let me assure you it grows every day
I was a one once but now I'm a we
'Cause I got my baby, dear little baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
Facing the world optimistically
Nothing can stop us so nobody try
'Cause baby's rough and full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I

Get out of our way, folks and give us some room
Watch how we bubble and blossom and bloom
Life was a prison but we got the key

Dear little baby, cute little baby
Look at my baby and me

",Me and My Baby,1998
Nigel Planer,"If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him

If someone in the movie show
Yelled, ""Fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg""
You'd notice him

And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then
Unless, of course, that person it should be
Invisible, inconsequential me

Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya, Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man for seven years
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human being next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who

Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there

Nigel Powell,"Advice to a lover
You don't have to suffer
Relax into your new life
Instinct is the enemy

Of all you have been taught
But now it's your only guide
And always remember to be fully in control
Let go for a moment

And the turbulence takes hold
But yes it's worth it, I think
Really it's worth it,
I don't know

Sometimes the feeling
Of utter contentment
Gets too much
But to worry about it

Is the ultimate luxury
Always remember that it pays to lose control

Hoy estoy en el bar, yo soy el galán, tengo nuevo carro, nueva ropa, why traigo nueva niña.
Si estoy bebiendo porque estoy contento desde te fuiste tu olor ya no siento.

why me siento bien no me quejare vine a celebrar que tu ya te haz marchado pero en realidad vamos a brindar por el gran papel de niña buena que habías jugado.
Why pensar que yo creí en tu amor hoy me he dado cuenta que yo estaba tan equivocado.
Brindo por mi donde quiera que estés, ya no encontrarás quien te haga mujer.
Why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)
Why este trago de olvido es por ti baby (uooaaaaaa uooooaaaaaa)

Levanta la mano si quieres brindar
Que diga su madre por ya no esta
Levanta tu copa para celebrar
Esa traicionera ya no volverá why voy a tomar me voy a embriagar porque ya no tengo que aguantar a quien me este mintiendo si estoy bebiendo porque estoy contento why se que no existe el dolor que hoy siento.

why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)
Why este trago de olvido es por ti baby (uooaaaaaa uooooaaaaaa)

Si lo sabe Dios que lo sepa todo el mundo (Zaaaa)

why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)

Night,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby

Night,"There was a time not too far gone
When I was changed by just a song
On the radio and in my car
The pounding of an electric guitar

Then the time came to make our stand
We started up a four-piece band
And the heat felt like spotlights
In the heart of a hot summer night

Ooh hot summer nights
Ooh hot summer nights

Return with me to when times were best
We were friends that could pass any test
Shared our hopes, our dreams, our goals
And the fundamental rolls

As we sang in the dark rooms
Happy just to play our tunes
It felt good when we got it right 
It felt good on a hot summer night 

Ooh hot summer nights
Ooh hot summer nights

So it lives and it always will 
The songs we sung are in us still 
Ringing out with all of their might 
In the heat of a hot summer night

You were only waiting for this moment to be free

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1988

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

And you've mailed them to yourself
And through the politics of compromise

Are like the rain that's crashing down
When there's no one left around

With the fear of wasting youth
Through the different times and with different eyes

That in love we're never sure
Still I'm holding on tight to memories
And there you go walking out the door

And the shadows you leave behind you
Are like the rain that's falling down
And your halo was left in town
And still the rain comes crashing down
And the sadness you leave behind you

Night Ranger,"Off on your own
It's a lonely ride
Seeing the things
Only seen through your eyes

Pick yourself up
Gonna try it again
Knowing that this time
You're reaching the end

The voice inside
Made me feel that I can fly
And you'll be there by my side
Forever

We're the restless kind
Lay your broken dreams upon the road
(And we will ride)
We're the restless kind
(In the morning light)
See the tears and joy fall from your eyes
(And we will ride)
We're the restless kind

Rolling down the road
With the wind in your hair
And maybe we're searching
For something we can share

One heart, one soul
Hold a mountain of dreams
The circle's unbroken
And rough around the seams

So don't you fear, my friend
You know I'll love you till the end
And I'll be there by your side
Forever

We're the restless kind
Lay your broken dreams upon the road
(And we will ride)
We're the restless kind
(In the morning light)
See the tears, the joy fall from your eyes
(And we will ride)
We're the restless kind

Yes, I know
How the world can fall upon you
And take you down, down, down
And make you feel like you're hollow inside

Do you understand
I will light the candle
And guide your soul
(Down the highway)
And give you faith in the world, oh

We're the restless kind
Lay your broken dreams upon the road
(And we will ride)
We're the restless kind
(In the morning light)
See the tears and joy fall from your eyes
(And we will ride)
We're the restless kind

(Oh woh, oh woh)
Lay your dreams upon the line
(Oh woh, oh woh)

Run a comb through my hair, head on out for some new foreign land
And all this could seem like a dream out the door
With everyday people, face down on the floor

I always said I could make it and be who I am
There's a new look in sight, what a change for the new modern man
With all this it seems, like I'm dying for more
The streets are on fire, never seen it before
It's like the sound of electric guitars

Worlds collide and hearts will be broken
Over and over it's the same every day-
How can I say what has never concerned me
The secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day

It's amazing to me, what a fool will believe to bet by
With a change of your mind, I can live, I can fly
The harder the come, the harder they fall
I never say maybe and I go for it all

Time has been a friend to you
Have you had it with your seesaw world
Yeah, I've had it with the same world, too.
Ain't no friend of mine.....oh, no

Here we are alone again
Down at Johnny's little seaside inn
Slammin' down a drink or two
Ooh, we were something, me and you

I know your life's been less than grand
This I can tell
And you took my heart and you took my hand
If time won't tell

Don't start thinking I'm alone tonight, no no
Don't start thinking I'll be coming home
To your lonely bed tonight
And don't start thinking I'm alone tonight, no no
Oh, it's over now, let the words go free
And don't start thinking 'bout you and me

You were always by my side
Yeah and love, it took its own sweet ride
Left a stranger where there was once me, oh yeah
Now we're staring at a sunset sky
Wishing time would turn its back a while
We'd be lovers like we used to be
Ooh, we were something, you and me

I know your life's been less than planned
This I can tell
And you took my heart and you took my hand
If time won't tell

Yeah

Bye bye baby, bye bye
In an everchanging world we live in
Will the flame carry on
Will it give us what's missin'
Bye bye baby, bye bye
Bye bye baby, bye bye
Dry your eyes
They're the same tears I cried.

So wake up little dark eyes
We've had our go for now
Though I'm leaving you with a bitter heart
I'm gonna leave you anyhow
So take them overdone lips
And that million dollar smile
And go use them up on some younger pup
That'll spend his time and money on your style

We tear and come undone
Fray a hole beyond repair
Lately I feel undone
You thread me like no one
In a way I always knew you’d come undone Our thread it wears away
We can’t change And we come undone
Float into a fight I’m never going to win
It’s so sad I can’t speak it’s a hopeless thing to weep Heavy heart I
Concede it’s not a war
Just trying to find some peace
The place between where we can meet
Lately I feel undone
You thread me like no one
In a way I always knew you’d come undone Our thread it wears away
We change
We can’t change
And we come undone

Pooling light on the water 
Trace the silver

I wish I knew 
That you felt the same 
Pull me down where I belong 
Pull me down where I belong 
And I wonder, if you ever leave 
Would the summer,  turn into a dream 
Will you pull me down where I belong 
Look at the stars 
Always shining above us
Steam of your breath 
Come in close as the seasons change 
You are cold 
To the touch as a lover 
So we drive under blue light through the streets 
Pull me down where I belong 
Pull me down where I belong 
And I wonder, if you ever leave

I can’t move on 
I’m barely breathing 
Numb aching feelings 
Tear me apart Keep thinking of the start 
Feels like we were so naive

I know you’ll cry yourself to sleep

Nightingale,"Thinking of the wood that guards the hillside
It has changed in many ways
The best friend that I ever had, I killed him
And I'll always remember his face
But I'm alone

I'm thinking of the voices from the parklane
How come they just disappeared
Right now I am back where it all started
And now the voices are calling again
But I'm alone

And the voices are only one voice
I hear it much clearer now
It's like on another level
Where I can hear the words without a blur
And it seems like that we can communicate
I hear him say he's such a lonely soul
A spirit from the lonely skies
And somehow I recall the voice
But I just can't place it in time
Hey, you should remember me! It said
And then it was gone
Faster than it came
Faster than it came

I am walking down the lane and I am shaking
Now the voices have returned
And I wonder who the hell I've been forsaking
Who will see my bridges burn?
And I am not alone
And I am not alone
I'm not alone

I saw my shadow move
But I didn't move
I has a life of itself
And it's breathing
And you can't runaway from your own shadow
I'm desperately trying to run away from myself
But the shadow is following me wherever I go
Just like my shadow, but it's not my shadow
It's not my shadow
It's not my shadow",Alone?,1996
Nightingale,"I have no control, he's making my moves
I am like a puppet on a string
To get a hold of my body he must empty my soul
But right now I wonder what the end will bring
I wonder if I am dreaming, if I do will I wake up
Before we reach the forest
Where my dreams will stop
Thinking about the woman
That has saved me from the cold
I really need her here now, I need a hand to hold

And the more that I think of you
The more you fade away
And here in this hell that I am going through
I can't even close my eyes and pray
The noise drives me crazy
But I remain calm
In this blur I hear a melody
It might be the final psalm

It's time for a change
An eye for an eye
Admitting it's strange
He'll live and I'll die
He's out for revenge
An eye for an eye
It's my turn to suffer now
The final goodbye
An eye for an eye
An I for an I

Desperation takes control
My life is slipping away
We're coming closer to the end
And there is nothing that I can do
I see through these eyes, I am blind!

I am thinking about my life the way it used to be
through the good times and the bad
And all the moments that I've had
It's not a way to end a life
But I guess it was just pretend
I am out walking this winter night
And everything is like before

We enter the forest now and I can see the tree
The rope is still hanging there
Like a monument to forever be
In the noise I hear laughters but I also hear cries
I guess it is my soul I hear
Knowing of his sacrifice?

Please someone release me father
Let this torture stop
I feel a tear is coming as I am climbing higher up
Please my friend forgive me
I wasn't meant to end this way
Trying to control myself, but I am the game you play

And the noose is around my neck
And now my time is here
I wish I could show my regrets and express my fear
Where am I going to can you tell me what we'll be
Will I come to where you are?
I guess I'll just die and see!

The gallow is ready now, an eye for an eye
I wish I could live somehow, but lifeless I'll lie
And he will be born again, I die oh I die
I am jumping now I am losing life an eye for an eye
It's only black and no signs of light

And the shadow has entered my body
And I can hear him say farewell with my voice

""Oh, when the night comes down
And the dark is conducting the nightfall overture""",Eye for an Eye,1996
Nightingale,"She woke me up in the morning
With a soft and gentle touch
And now I realize that I need her too much
I really don't know if my body will move
If I try to walk away
And something in her eyes are begging me to stay
Begging me to stay

Back on my feet, I'm standing
But I can hardly walk
She's bound to mystery
And I am a sparrow and she's the hawk
I know I must leave and get on with the search
My soul has left me in the lurch
And there is something about her smile
That's killing me inside

Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
I know she can see right through my disguise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
And when she smiles is the closest that I'll ever get
To paradise

I am at her door I am leaving
Now it's time to say goodbye
I can see a gypsy tear is shining in her eye
I try to say that I will soon return
And seek shelter for the night
But now I must return to where the dark deceived the light

Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
I know she can see right through my disguise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
She is the one that makes my lifeforce arise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
I know she can see right through my disguise
Totally drowned in gypsy eyes
And when she smiles is the closest that I'll ever get
To paradise",Gypsy Eyes,1996
Nightingale,"I woke up laying in this bed
I didn't know if I was 'live or dead
Have I returned to reality
Have I escaped this evil entity?

I'v been...
Higher than the sky
Falling in and out of time
Once I saw him die
My remorse ain't worth a dime

If I only knew what was going on
I hear no voices, pray to god that they're gone
Someone must have found and then brought me here
I have been released from all the doubt and fear
Then this woman came into the room
She was so scared, but still she tried to stay
She spoke a tongue I couldn't understand
My guardian angel from a foreign land

She tried to explain how she brought me here
She found me lifeless in the cold
And there was something about me that wasn't right
So she rescued me from eternal night
And even though I can't understand the words she's saying
She's talking to my soul
And there is mystery in her gleaming eyes
",Higher Than They Sky,1996
Nightingale,"I try to escape from the shadows of mine
It's following me wherever I go
It's like someone is breathing behind
My own reflection has turned into my foe
I hear his voice as he speaks unto me
I am here to torment, you will never be free
You'll know the difference of pleasure and pain
If you're sunshine the I am the rain
Can you remember can you recall
You put the noose around my neck
I won't surrender until you fall
You will obey

I am from the other side
And I have come to teach you pain
I'll give a lesson in evil
From the evil side
You're the ocean that I have to drain
And I have come here to reign

It makes this noise that will never stop
I will be strong and never give it up
My shadow drag me like a magner field
There is no return the maze has been sealed

Can you remember can you recall
You said it would be such an innocent game
You're the offender, and now you crawl
And you obey!

I wonder where we're going
We're gettin' closer to the hill
And the forest of the nightmares
Will we do the same again?

Will he see me hanging just like the way he did
And will he see me end my life
Just the way I ended his?

Hide and seek of life and death
Now it's my turn to see you gasp for your last breath
My friend!

There is this noise in my head
That forces me to do things I do not want to
I hear him say:
I want your body dead
So that I can be reborn, it's my turn to live now
I have been here in this place
that turns hell into heaven for too long now
I will have access to your mind
And I'll get what I want!",A Lesson in Evil,1996
Nightingale,"Just another midnight hour
Enjoying the cold of a dark winter night
I see the darkness devour
Everything that once was light
And the stars in the sky
Are so lifeless and so grey

Walking in the light of the moon
When the night repairs the day
From the trees comes a mournful tune
I am not alone I can hear them say
The moon is your guide
There is no place you can hide

Oh, when the night comes down
And all the colors turns black and white
Oh, when the night comes down
And the dark is conducting the nightfall overture

Who am I in the eyes of the world
What have I done that will remain
Who am I? Will I ever know?
But right now I am the king of this winter lane

Is there anybody out there?
In the middle of the mist in the field
The air doesn't relieve me anymore
Something is here that I have never felt before
And it's closing in on me

I am lost in the maze of the night
Surrounded by lights so dark
I am losing all track of time
I'm trying to come out of this endless park

And the air is so dry
I can hear the daylight cry

Is there anybody out there?

I see the day is coming
The night is led astray
The dawn of new desires
The end of yesterday
I walk the road to nowhere
Ah, that's what I call home
If I only knew what I was heading for
But I don't have a place to roam

And then I heard the voices calling
Across the sky in flames
I could hear them clearer now
Once again I could hear them say

Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
But I'll remain awake
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
Could be my last mistake
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!

From a place of shelter
Where I could get some rest
I was so cold but I couldn't care
And soon the sun caressed

Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
But I'll remain awake
Dream, dream!
I can hear them say
Close your eyes my friend!
Dream, dream!
I hear the voices say
Go to sleep my friend!
I'll make no more mistake
Dream, dream!
I could hear them say
Go to sleep my friend!

My frozen eyes refuse to see
Something tells me it's too dangerous to sleep
It's like I've been through this before
Here I am! Frozen to the core
Frozen to the core

I know I must be dreaming
Or am I still awake
Hallucinations rule me
But right now, what difference does it make?
I am falling again

Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
But I remain awake
Dream, dream!
I hear the shadows say
Go to sleep my friend!
Dream, dream!
I hear the darkness breathe
Go to sleep my friend!
And I fade away

Close your eyes my friend!
And now I fade away

And now I fade away",Nightfall Overture,1996
Nightingale,"Surrounded by silence, no-one is here with me.
I am alone, lost and solitaire.
And I have heard all the stories of heaven,
but where is the one I should meet'
No heartbeat, nor breath, only darkness everywhere.

Why am I here, I'm lost to this world, when innocence is my only excuse'
I saw no light, no replay of life, I felt neither joy or pain.
I wish to open my eyes and realize I'm not in paradise.

Chosen to be in the world of the blind
but why torture me with the presence of mind...

I want your body dead so that I can be reborn. It's my turn to live
now. I've been here in this place that turns hell into heaven for too long now.
I will have access to your mind and I will get what I want.
I still have some memories and an image of who I was,
I remember the tree and the shadow and her eyes.
Am I alive or is this a dream; a dream that never ever will end'
I don't want to know.
Deep inside of nowhere; trapped in a world that fears the light.
Deep inside of nowhere. Now it feels like I'm fading,
Now it feels like I'm fading away.
Suddenly the darkness awakened and it feels like it's clearing my mind.
My vision is gone, erasing the one I am.
Depraved of myself, now it's taking my thoughts away,
I feel it's enclosing me now but I don't want to go
Deep inside of nowhere; leaving this world that feeds the night.
Deep inside of nowhere; and it feels like I'm falling,
It feels like I'm falling asleep...
Waking up from my dreamless sleep,
It feels like I travel with the speed of light.
Somehow I feel a glimpse of hope inside,
But I guess it's far too early to tell.
I can't remember where I am, I can't remember where I used to be,
But I can remember what I think right now.
Am I closing in on heaven or am I closer to hell' Still no light around
But I feel what's lost have been found.
Deep inside of nowhere; still trapped in a world that fears the light.
Deep inside of nowhere. I'm lost to a world that feeds the night.
Deep inside of nowhere. I'm trapped in a world that feeds the night.
Deep inside of nowhere. Maybe I'm returning,
Maybe I'm returning to life...",Deep Inside of Nowhere,1996
Nightingale,"I woke up with a feeling of emptiness inside.
Suddenly felt so lonely like a part of me had died, oh.
I could sacrifice the knowledge and the powers I possess,
To relive the moment when my hand caressed your frozen soul.
Nevermore, never ever, here beside me.
You and I alone when daylight is falling. I'll never see you again.
Deafened by the silence, present in this room.
Waiting for my maker to save me from this gloom, oh.
And then I had this sight inside me I had never seen before,
And suddenly the one I missed, came in through my door.
Finally, you're here beside me, in the darkness.
Something about you has changed, I don't seem to know you.
I see in your eyes you're not here. It's not you.
Stricken by illusion, vision in my mind,
a victim of confusion, all sense is left behind, oh.
I felt that deep inside him was still a part of you.
So I seduced a shadow and what might be you came through
Into my womb.
Oh I feel, you're here inside me, and I will give you shelter now.
I will always be here. I know that I've found you again.",Intermezzo,1996
Nightingale,"No longer a shadow, once again I walk the face of the earth.
I'm in his body, I'm free to live,
And I will make sure that he will see no rebirth.
He'll never find the answer, he'll never know the way
I'll never ever forgive him for what he did to me that day.
I don't know how to be in this world, I left so long ago.
Now I'm back in the shape of another,
But that is something that no one ever will know.
I'll never tell the secret. no one would believe it anyway.
Well nothing's going to take me away, no. I have decided to stay.

I see the horizon through the eyes of a stranger,
the one that I'm living inside.
For seventeen years I've been held in the darkness,
My life is no longer denied.
I wonder where he is right now'
Probably trapped in the parallel sky.
I've been there, I have felt all this darkness.
Though I was reprieved,
I was far too young to die.
I regained the power. I was strong, I returned
Like a breathing shadow, I will receive what I've earned.
Even though I pretend I'm someone else, I have finally had my revenge.",Revival,1996
Nightingale,"It's morning again.
I wish all the emptiness would end and my friend would return.
Though I know that you're still alive, I'm scared, I'm almost paralyzed
Of the emotions that's growing inside. And something is missing.
And when I take a look around me, it's like I see you everywhere,
Anywhere.

So long, still I wonder why. So long, and my river runs dry,
And I know all the secrets you know, But I don't know where to go.
Life must go on, though it is hard not to end it all.
I wish I had known what you knew. I'm blaming myself.
The shadow is oh, so strong, its power distorted my view.
And something is missing.
And when I take a look around me, it's like I see you everywhere,
Everywhere.",So Long (Still I Wonder),1996
Nightingale,"Now he's here inside her ocean sky.
He's dreaming again, he's released from all his fears.
I'm standing here watching the world through his eyes,
There's no reason to leave since I know no time never dies.

But I can fell the rain upon your cheek
'Cause you don't know that I could steal the moon for you.
You don't know I'd sing an endless croon for you.
It's strange in here, knowing I'll have your name.
I'll never be me, I'm like art in a stolen frame.

And if I would die, would I be reborn like you,
And start all over again, with a life so fresh and new
A combination of love hate and jealousy.
I'm stuck in here but you will soon be free
You don't know I could steal the moon for you,
You don't know I could steal the moon for you,",Steal the Moon,1996
Nightingale,"Suddenly something changed inside as like the darkness turn to light.
And I saw reflections from the past flashing by
Like a star fall in the night.
It feels like I'm turn into someone else,
It's like my past life said goodbye.
Reincarnation of our souls well now I know it's not a lie.
I wonder what I will be or when I'll arrive'
The magic moment my body comes alive.
But who am I to say all this, I may not even remember what I miss.
I can come to a different part of the earth, maybe to another world.
Who can tell'
I know he is out there pretending he's me,
I guess it's a sight I will never see.
I still remember a few things from my past,
But only things in relation to aghast
Here in this waiting room for one's to be,
I guess there's nothing more to do
than to realize I might be reborn and the whole of me will be new
Oh how I wish I could dream again so I could dream of you.
But It took the last of my soul, it took the last of my soul,
but I remember you.
I wonder if she can remember, or maybe the world doesn't even exist.
To me it feels like yesterday, but I might have been lost,
I might have been lost for ages.
Wishing I could be more human, though I know I still have a soul.
With a few sad memories, without any sentences structure,
I may be lost forever. And the darkness turn black again,
And now the journey will begin, am I moving to another stage,
In the process of clearing my thoughts.
It seems like my mind is harder to erase
I may remember too much from the past.
The darkness' no longer carrying me,
and it feels like I'm back at square one.
The pressure is driving me insane,
and maybe there is no sanity left.
This stage of cleansing is twisting my thoughts,
I can think no more, and once again I'm falling a sleep...
Unintelligent life is born, our friend is no longer here.
He's replaced, he's initialized and no one shed a tear'
He was so eager to live again, but now he's gone for all time.
It took the last of his soul.",Thoughts from a Stolen Soul,1996
Nightingale,"I'm all alone
Waiting for no one
I see the daylight fade away

I'm so afraid
I know you're around me
I hear you crying in the wind

If I could bring you back
If I had the power, I'd give you my world
And my life, you'd have it all
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day

I've never seen a pair of digits quite like yours, before
And I have traveled shore to shore
In such arduous pallor
Your almost perfect body's got me quivering in a ball

To that brass cowgirl with her hands petting your crotch
And humping you in towering grass
Naked and gender bending
What makes you think that the two of your will last
For there's no dame or man for her
There's just this open road where she hails down some pervert
With the usage of her giant thumb
But jelly bean you can never comprehend the intellect of her mind
And just because you can make her come with your hand it doesn't mean she'll be your woman.

My thumbelina
I've never seen a pair of digits quite like yours before
And I have traveled shore to shore
In such arduous pallor
Your almost perfect body's got me quivering in a ball

But 'twas a loon on the hillside
Planted a seed between your thighs
You fancy him as your therapist
But he's just a sadistic sodomist who gave you the bastard kid

Nightmare of You,"You were sickened at the vowing of silence
I was taken by a permanent high
Two lovers all you turned on how romantic
Never need a guillotine to get you off my mind
You were swept up in the buzz of a marriage
I was secretly hoping one of us might die
A close call would have ended up with the carriage
Lets call it extra lets call it why

You're just like your dad, surprise
You don't only share his eyes
It's the truth that's in your hand
It's a knack for telling awful lies
Why am I always right?

As you slept away the day in my bedroom
I found a criminal use for a pillow
I love you terribly I swear that this is true
But I just can't stop my hands from smothering you
I skipped town on a flight to your city
There I crept up to your lover's window
He poured a scotch and sobbed alone in the kitchen
I took that aim and then I let it blow

You're just like your dad, surprise
You don't only share his eyes
It's the truth that's in your hand

You're just like your dad, surprise

It's the truth that's in your hand
It's a knack for telling awful lies
Why am I always right?

Stick a fork in a socket
Do what you like
Just make sure that I'm far out of your life
Take an axe to your fingers
Carve your eyes
Cut out your tongue and we'll call this a tie
Cut out your lying tongue and we'll call this a tie

You're just like your dad, surprise
You don't only share his eyes
You're just like your dad, surprise

Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in a sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack

Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories

Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock

You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest
From just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained, is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges
At the thought of syringes

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard whose dick is always hard

Oversexed flexing his pecs

You used to do that to me back in twelve-fifty-three
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch

And switch 'round the house in a blind rage

Times were tight and sour
The letter A was sprayed in a circle everywhere

And everybody's head was gettin' shaved or spiked
My sister stitched her flares and made 'em into drainpipes
She was into Adam Ant and Wuthering Heights
I was getting into Madness and grifter bikes

Mom had to work late, I had no complaints
Used to get away with murder when Grandad babysat
Used to play fox and hound 'til the sun came down,
Singin' Lip Up Fatty, running wild through the ghost town

And all I wanted was Doc boots and braces
My ear pierced, ""So, mum, what's a racist?""
She didn't explain that we weren't quite Caucasian,
As we could see black children on some future occasion
And she'd keep that shtum
All my friends are gettin' brainwashed
NF and swastikas they're scratchin' on the desktops

Riots and violence on the TV
Broken down on Newsround while eatin' Toast Toppers, watchin' coppers get beat down
Church discos and trips with the play scheme
Dancin' to ska, kissing the girl of my dreams
My tenth birthday and those two-tones stay pressed
Money in my card I bought One Step Beyond, yes

And oh, my god she did devour
Cast a spell called depression made a living hell
Turned man against man forgot the boys and girls
We had no future, home computer
Had to make do with what we had
Knock-a-door-run and the hand-me-down gowns
Current beat, upbeat, Cracker Jack of Underground, synthpop, Muppet Show, electro on the radio

He?s got the next best friend started scratchin' and breakin'
Snatch your racks and battery by the stack to keep the boom box from going flat
Didn't cope and went in over the store with a performance kid this place has never been so packed
Street light for a spot light, cardboard box for a stage
And if you had a score to settle you resolved it with your breakin'

Fate goes on ahead, can't wait

Seems you're only friend is time as you wait
Hate can't wait to take positive hostage
But it's alright, time's on your side

Mr optimistic and his best friend confidence in a new light

Mr negativity, hating his boys and slope away as hope starts to say
It's alright, time's on your side

Don't let it bring you down, it's wrong
There's always a way around, so hold on
Open up your mind and let light in

Don't let it bring you down, it's just fate
There's always a way around, if you wait
Open up your mind and let light in

When we get to the party
Party packs no doubt
Enjoyment's at the door
Kick ya disappointment out

There's fun on the floor
Good vibes on the mic
Spite tries to fight
With hate and dislike

But will gets his way 'cos will's got the power
Time has the last say 'cos time has the hour
It's alright, time's on your side

Don't let it bring you down, it's wrong
There's always a way around, so hold on

I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A.
But now he's waiting tables cause their's rent to pay
Companies downsizing, inflation's rising
Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
Forgot to count how many times he been blessed
So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack
And once it hits his brain, starts a chain react
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet
He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street
And all of sudden he's like, Jesse James
Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool

Knew what I wanted, she was up in the cut
Swinging that butt, like race you out here
Only rapped the benz, and rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearing, champagne waving
Jewels around the neck, live style she's craving
Ain't no saving, she's doing enough spending
If you do the lending, she'll do the bending
Straight machine vending, it's money for take
Shopping sprees get her on her knees
And if you hit her with keys of your crib, you acting funny
Come home one day, find her counting out your money
From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo
If you're broke she'll spit, and if you're rich she might swallow

Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips

Some be out smarted
Some be over bound by the blindin' rays

Get trapped in the maze
See back in the days
When I was juvenile
I dreamed of rockin' on the mic
In a brand new style
Now I'm shakin' these bones
Tryin' to get these shoes
Outbidded major crews
I'm paid crazy dues
Now I'm speakin' on you
They just slept on me
And rumors start spreadin'
Just like a disease
I'll have you down on your knees
Below the spot ground zero
Turn brown and burn down Rome just like Nero

Don't make me say it

tomorrow, still I hope I get to ending
I'm out of time, I'm out of rhyme, I'm out of reason
Seasons change and leave me out in the cold
Story's old, tale's been told by many scholar
Got fist full of dollars, and a pocket full of love
God above, if you hear me crying
Tried to sell my soul but no one's buying
Lord, strike me down now, if I'm lying
It's getting cold, it's time for dying

Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine

Let man who's free from sin
Cast the first stone and begin the violence
Let man whose words ring true
Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence
Let the one's who lose their way
Live to see just one more day in the sunshine
Let the one's who chose to stray
Recognize the price they'll pay in their lifetime

Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine

Sitting here, waiting for my roads to cross
You nailed me down and you watched me bleed
So lay my head against the earth
Plant my body like a seed
You can't always get the things you want, love
Get what you deserve and maybe what you need
So fill my hole with precious dirt, love
Turn the soil and plot the weed

Come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, come on and watch me shine
Like the world is mine
Today, watch me shine",Today (Watch Me Shine),1998

It made me so glad that I almost had to cry then
I never believed in love at first sight
But when you held me tight that night
I knew with you it wasn't a lie

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing to do

Your soul was sweet your lips were warm and tender
I wanted your kiss I couldn't resist surrender
I could have sworn that violins played 
'Cause when the rhythm swayed with you so near
I heard the sound of your sigh

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing to do

I heard you sighin'
I felt like cryin'
You weren't lying
No no
What a sweet thing that was
And then I heard you whisper the word forever
I knew that we'd spend the rest of our lives together
That feeling we shared 
Was too much to bear
And when you said you cared, I swear
I felt that I was ready to die

Nightwalkers,"Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth

beside the cross on your grave

Needed elsewhere
to remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows

Nor enlightened by lessons of Christ
I'll never understand the meaning of the right

Nightwish,"Remember the first dance we shared?
Recall the night you melted my ugliness away?
The night you left with a kiss so kind
Only a send of beauty left behind

Ah, dear friend I remember the night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls

As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love for me now has to die
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me

Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember beauty is found within

Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you",Beauty and the Beast,

Asks the boy with a spark in his eye
Know why the nightingale sings?
Is the answer to everything

Spinning my fantasies all around
Freed from the gravital leash
I swear the heaven's in my reach

Dancing with the spirit of the air
In this ocean so open and fair
Making love to the gods above
On my maiden voyage so bold

Landing safely to the blue lagoon
Don't know if this is the earth or the moon
Joy of living is no more a mask
The Eden I found will forever last

Migrating with the geese
My soul has finally found peace
Doesn't matter that man has no wings
As long as I hear the nightingale sing...

Nightwish,"Born from silence, silence full of it
A perfect concert, my best friend
So much to live for, so much to die for
If only my heart had a home

Sing what you can't say
Forget what you can't play
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
Walk within my poetry, this dying music
My love letter to nobody

Never sigh for better world
It's already composed, played and told
Every thought the music I write
Everything a wish for the night

Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin
Died for the beauty the one in the garden
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom
Failed in becoming a god
Never sigh

If you read this line
Remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse
Songmaker's cry, the one without tears
For I've given this its strength
And it has become my only strength
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life

Teach me passion for I fear it's gone
Show me love, hold the lorn
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me
I'm sorry
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)
I live no more to shame nor me nor you

And you
I wish I didn't feel for you anymore

For whom the prey weeps
Bow before a war
Call it religion

Some wounds never heal
Some tears never will
Dry for the unkind
Cry for mankind

Their only comfort

Need to understand
No need to forgive
No truth no sense left to be followed

like meeting an old friend

You made me what I am!""

Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
Whilst I wander on this path of the night

Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your saliva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness be my birth

Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The night wish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe

The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved's land

Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside

Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
Were my tears wept upon promises undone

Make me believe
To you and your love again

Nightwish,"They came for him one winter's night.
Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
his pistol had been found.
They marched him to the station house,
he waited till the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
he knew that he'd been wronged.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
he heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
for ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
He knew that it would cost him dear,
but yet he dare not say.
Just where he'd been that fateful night,
a secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beat like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
he spent his final night of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
back in her arms again he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.
Over the hills and,
over the hills and,
over the hills and far away.
Each night within his prison cell,
he looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
back in his arms again she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
he swears he will return one day.
As sure as the river reach the seas,
back in his arms is where she'll be.
Over the hills and far away,
she prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the sea,
back in her arms is where he'll be.

Nightwish,"I was born amidst the purple waterfalls
I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past
I witnessed the beauty of the beast

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin,
To love as I loved you?

Soon to be freed from care, from human pain

Time pays us but with earth & dust
And a dark, silent grave.

To see another black rose born

Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within

Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek

And took a step outside

Once I knew all the tales
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and fly

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone

The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true lovers
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love n' loss

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
the one behind will lead me

Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman's noose

Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep

Relive the old sin of
Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast

Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I'll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love

My fall will be for you",Ghost Love Score,2004

The choirs were vast

Arrested, he was bound.
They said there'd been a robbery,
His pistol had been found.

They marched to the station house,
He waited for the dawn.
And as they led him to the dock,
He knew that he'd been wrong.
""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say.
He knew without an alibi,
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.

Over the hills and far away,
For ten long years he'll count the days.
Over the mountains and the seas,
A prisoner's life for him there'll be.

He knew that it would cost him dear,
But yet he dare not say.
Where he had been that fateful night,
A secret it must stay.
He had to fight back tears of rage.
His heart beats like a drum.
For with the wife of his best friend,
He spent his final night of freedom.

Over the hills and far away,
He swears he will return one day.
Far from the mountains and the seas,
Back in her arms he swears he'll be.
Over the hills and far away.

Over the hills and,
Over the hills and,
Over the hills and far away.

Each night within his prison cell,
He looks out through the bars.
He reads the letters that she wrote.
One day he'll know the taste of freedom.

Over the hills and far away,
She prays he will return one day.
As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
Back in his arms she swears she'll be.

In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the long road and on down the causeway
Do they still meet there by the cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse

And a dark, silent grave.

Did we get this far just to feel your hate
Did we play to become only pawns in the game
How blind can you be, don`t you see
You chose the long road but we`ll be waiting

Bye bye beautiful",Bye Bye Beautiful,2007
Nightwish,"Running for her life
The dark rain from her eyes still falls
Breathtaking butterfly
Chose a dark day to live

Save one breath for me

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath

Why do I miss someone
I never met, with bated breath I lay
Seawinds brought her to me
A butterfly, mere one-day miracle of life
And all the poetry in the world
Finally makes sense to me

Save one death for me

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath

Put to rest all that`s not life
Drink for beauty and fill my blank page

Sometimes a dream turns into a dream

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath",Cadence of Her Last Breath,2007
Nightwish,"Heaven today is but a way
To a place I once called home
Heart of a child, one final sigh
As another love goes cold

Once my heart beats to the rhythm of the falling snow
blackened below
The river now flows - a stream on molten virgin snow

For the heart I'll never have
For the child forever gone
The music flows because it longs
For the heart I once had

Living today without a way
To understand the weight of the world
Faded and torn, old and forlorn
My weak and hoping heart

For the child, for the night
For the heart I once had
I believe and foresee
Everything I could ever be

Time will not heal a dead boy's scars
Time will kill",For the Heart I Once Had,2007
Nightwish,"An old man by a seashore
At the end of day
Gazes the horizon
With seawinds in his face
Tempest-tossed island
Seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted
And a ship without a name

Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
The ones on their travels homeward from afar

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind long ago

The albatross is flying
Making him daydream
The time before he became
One of the world`s unseen
Princess in the tower
Children in the fields
Life gave him it all:
An island of the universe

Now his love`s a memory
A ghost in the fog
He sets the sails one last time
Saying farewell to the world
Anchor to the water
Seabed far below
Grass still in his feet
And a smile beneath his brow

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind long ago

So long ago
So long ago

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind so long ago

So long ago",The Islander,2007

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer, torn apart by chains of Hell

One last perfect verse
Yet still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway

One for God save me

These meadows of heaven

Beneath the blue
Beneath the pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped
Again and again and again
I know I will die alone, but loved
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
And if you want
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
Years have I been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first
And give me a death
I always longed for

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infacticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned upon this altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me

Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005
Thomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text

Save me!

Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love

Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such ocean's within

I will always love you

Alone without himself

War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

You receive but what you give

Reach for the hand held heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach and catch me before I fall

Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones whoever dare

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Reach for the hand held heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach and catch me before I fall

Reach for a friend whoever cares
For someone whoever dares
Reach to catch me when I fall

Reaching for the doubting one by heart
Hearing voices calling
Catch the one who's falling

For someone whoever dares

Me ashamed of my own

In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name

Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field

Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape, edenbeam
We kill with her own loving heart

Snow white, pitch-black, your life such strife 
Heavenward, deep down, I’ll show you such sights

All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

A silent symphony
A hollow opus one, two, three

Sometimes the sky is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters

Resting pipes, verse of bore
Rusting keys without a door

Sometimes the within is piano black
Piano black over cleansing waters

All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing",Song of Myself,2011

Every twist and turn a wonder-dale 
It’s a scary ride we’d give anything to take 
Let yourself bleed 
Leave a footprint on every island you see

Snow white, pitch-black, your life such strife 
Heavenward, deep down, I’ll show you such sights 
Believe it, we live as we dream, scream

He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down

The magic ride, the mermaid cove?

Let it bleed 
Leave a footprint on every island you see

Sowing of doubt, troll beneath the bridge

I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world
Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future, relived my past
I witnessed the beauty of the beast

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

My tale is the most bitter truth
Time pays us but with earth and dust and a dark, silent grave
Remember my child, without innocence the cross is only iron
Hope is only an illusion, and Ocean Soul's nothing but a name
The Child bless thee and keep thee forever

Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writing's on the gardens book, in the minute of a lover's look

A house of cards from a worn-out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand

""We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones
Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born
The potential people who could have been here in my place 
But who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara
Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton
We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA 
So massively exceeds the set of actual people
In the teeth of those stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here
We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds
How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state 
From which the vast majority have never stirred?""

There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers
Having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one
And that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity
From so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been
And are being, evolved",The Greatest Show on Earth,2015

In tongues from the time before man
Listen to a daffodil tell her tale

The cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched
The elsewhere creatures yet unseen
Finally your number came up, freefall awaits the brave

Writing noughts till the end of time
Come, surf the clouds
Race the dark

Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

The answer to the riddle before your eyes
Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writing's on the gardens book, in the minute of a lover's look
Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn-out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand

Come, taste the wine
Raise the blind
They will guide you from the light
Writing noughts till the end of time
Come, surf the clouds
Race the dark
It feeds from the runs undone
Meet me where the cliff greets the sea

Riding hard every shooting star
Come to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox
Come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great élan, dance a jig at the funeral, come!

Nightwish,"The end

The songwriter?s dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of Empathica,
Of Innocence
Empathica
Innocence

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer, torn apart by chains of Hell

One last perfect verse
Yet still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there and then
These meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world

Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free

Tuck me in
Beneath the blue
Beneath the pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped
Again and again and again
I know I will die alone, but loved
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
And if you want
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
Years have I been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first
And give me a death
I always longed for

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infacticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned upon this altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
A whore for the cold world
A whore for the cold world

Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005
Thomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text

Save me!

Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love

Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such ocean's within
In the end
I will always love you

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him... where my money at?

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Nijinsky Style,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

So romantic, too naive

And as they call
I hang my head in shame
Any other would could call their bluff
But any other world would scream enough
The ocean cries louder to me

Save the whale . . . save the whale . . . save the whale . . .save the whale . . . save the whale . . . save the whale . . .
To never kiss and tell
Their factory ship farewell
With every scream
A piece of conscience dies
Lying in a crimson resting place
Crying with a smile upon his face
The giant dies trusting in me

Any other world would call their bluff
But any other world would scream enough
The ocean cries louder to me

And he wonders where the last ten million went

Nika Kocharov,"When I came to
Your smell on me
I reached around the bed and grabbed a cigarette out of your bag
Sound of you breathing
Feel of your skin
Brought back some memories
I never thought this all could happen to me
Ten hours are missing from memory,
I vaguely can recall pain and pleasure mixing in one bowl
My mind is spinning
I know the bliss
Ten million miles away my flesh and bones are dreaming in a haze
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come ans so will the sin",Midnight Gold [Eurovision 2016 - Georgia],

High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Calling out to you
Here I will see you tonight
Tonight...

Even if I went to you,
Your touch would be elusive,
Even if I surrender
The war would not be over
Even if I bled for you
My heart would go on bleeding
If I hide my face from you
This love would feel no shame

Cause I know there's a place for me
Where you and I can dance
I know there's a place for me
And you will be there
Take me there...

You are the one
It's your love pulling me back, calling me back
I'll run to you baby...
You are the one
It keeps on pulling me back, calling me back
I'll run to you baby...

You can turn and walk away
Pretend that we are dreaming
Confess that we are satisfied
Knowing we are seeing
We can take a chance tonight
And lead into the morning
We can hold each others hands
Together face the fight

And I know there's a place where everyone will dance
Yes, I know there's a place for me and you will be there
Please take me there

You are the one
It's your love pulling me back, calling me back
And I'll run to you baby...

Raid them with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day

Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way

Except I'm cool with Vader and blowing up rooms that's full of strangers

I'd rather watch it fall to the palm of my hand

From sitting on pins waiting for my sky to fall
I'm taking up giving in
So here's the wheel, I'm putting my feet up
Take another look at me baby
Today I'm taking on catastrophe

Only hold ya back
Only slow your pace

Go ahead and cry baby
Cry baby all night long
Just like I cried baby
On the pillow that you used to lay on

The sun is out and my
Sorrows finally drowned
So go on and turn it up
""Cause it's my favorite song
I sucked it up
And washed your memory down
I've finally let you go
And now you comin' back around

One minute sooner and my heart
Was good as gold
But time's a bitch and now it's
Turned my heart to stone, so

[Chorus]

You made our bed
And now I gladly lay in it
""Cause there's way more room
And I use every single bit
It's true it's sad
""Cause you and I we were the shit
""Cause our love was real
And all you got now's counterfeit

But it's cool I'm feelin' better all the time
As long as I know that you sittin' home cryin' , so

No wonder you cry baby
Cry baby all night long

I lose my cool

I disappear
You got me feelin' oh, oh, oh

Damn I said it first
Why'd I say it first?

I know better than to show my hand
I understand don't jump the gun
Just play the game
I spoke too soon and now I'm wonderin'
Does he or doesn't he feel the same

I could kick myself for all that
Comin' out my mouth
I'd take it back if I could
I couldn't hold it in, hold my breath
Just pretend
He just makes me feel too good

What'd I say that for?

Rules of the road
You're one of the dopes for whom they were made

Follow that kiss
And recklessly miss a bend in the road

So love is a hoax
A glittering string of little white lies
These are the jokes
And what if they bring tears to your eyes

Love often shows a funny return
The brighter it glows, the longer you burn
Lord only knows love has little concern
For the fools of the road

But that's how it goes
You live and you learn the rules of the road
Yeah, that's how it goes

On the crazy clothes we wore
Ain't it fun to look back
And to see it's all been done before

All those nights together
Are a special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you're dancing next to me

'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger
What's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause

I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

Oh, but that's the road that got us here

Let's move past the bad times
But before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget
And learn from the mistakes we made

Nikki Blonsky,"Once I was a selfish fool
Who never understood
Never looked inside myself
Though on the outside, I looked good

Then we met and you made me
The man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you
No matter what you weigh

'Cause without love
Life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love
Life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer

Tracy, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lying
Never set me free, Tracy, no, no, no

Living in the ghetto
Black is everywhere ya go
Who'd have thought I'd love a girl
Whose skin was white as winter snow

In my ivory tower
Life was just a Hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate
And I'm never going back

'Cause without love
Life is like a beat that you can't follow
Without love
Life is Doris Day at The Apollo

Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be without love
So darling, never set me free
No, I'm yours forever
Never set me free, no, no, no

If I'm left without my baby doll
I don't know what I'll do
Link, I've got to break out
So that I can get my hands on you

And girl, if I can't touch you
Then I'm gonna lose control
Seaweed, you're my black white knight
I've found my blue-eyed soul
Sweet freedom is our goal

Trace, I wanna kiss you
Let me out at the next toll

Without love
Life is like a prom that won't invite us
Without love
It's like getting my big break and laryngitis

Without love
Life's a '45 when you can't buy it
Without love
Life is like my mother on a diet

Like a week that's only Mondays
Only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked 'Do Not Enter'

Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Yes, now you've captured me
Without love, I surrender happily

Without love, oh Seaweed
Never set me free , no, no, no, I ain't lying
Never set me free, no, no, no
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love

And let you slay me
I showed you my heart
And now, I'm sorry

Head first into you
I fell in, too deep
Not much I could do
But watch you leave me

I've tried but I can't
Guess, I don't understand
The meaning of letting you go

I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
A struggle to breathe

Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby, without you it seems
I'm a fish out of water

Thought you were the one
I was dreaming
What I thought was love
Just left me empty

No turning back time
No more pretending
No rainbow inside
No happy ending

Though I try, I'm confused
Where to start without you
My world has been turned upside down

I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
A struggle to breathe

Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby, without you it seems
I'm a fish out of water

I've surrendered to the unconscious
You are the haze that grips my mind
I opened the flow gates, it hurts in slow motion
Baby, I'm running out of time

And I've tried, oh, oh

I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
A struggle to breathe

Butterfly with no wings

Left the girls in the rearview
I got into first position
While they were hittin on him, flirtin with him, I was turning his ignition
Thought he was just a game to win

And even to this day I'm really not sure why

Words we didn't say are what haunt me now

Did my constant devotion scare you away
When I close my eyes I dream the same dream
That we stayed in love and you're holding me

[Nikki D] What's wrong?
[Busta Rhymes]	Help, help, help, help!
[Nikki D] Honey, what's wrong?
[Busta Rhymes]	You looked chopped
Awwwwww! Awwwww!

It's shop time, in line, hurry on the quickness
Couch gorillas, you all need fitness
Word up, word up, kick out the dead presidents
All nightmares and Elm Street residents
Come on down, there's nothin wrong with that
But when Booga Bears do it - it's wack
In fact, I was in the shop the other day
Girls, hear me out, okay?
Reading Essence magazines
The latest fashions, adults and teens
Walkman kicks with the Jam that's Def
I see a female with a mask as I glance to the left
Slide to get my nails done
A manicure for sure - huh, can ya dig it, hon?
Suddenly the girl's mask came down
Grill piece looks ill, skips town
Pieces of skin were here, there, everywhere
A horror flick and scare
Why do so much when it shouldn't be done?
There's someone for everyone
No, you had to go overboard
Lipstick, but lips got cold sores
Next time you need a fix-up, don't mix up the chop shop
Honey, you need the beauty shop

Your face looks chopped
(You need the beauty shop)
Your face looks chopped

Your face looks chopped

(The beauty shop

Now fish lip with lipstick don't match
Caked up make-up makes up the monster mash
Splash bubble bath, don't laugh
Not the natural look, but the truth rises to the top
Chop into the beauty shop flock, don't drop
Look in deep skin, then stop
If you see no wins, don't spend your ends
On those millions of hundreds, or even tens
Of pairs of pieces of horse hairs, tear upon
Ashes of trashes of where they shared food
Don't be rude, let self rule
Who'll be cool in the midst of confused
With this on the mind at the end of the mop 
Clean it up please, at the beauty shop

Build up a structure, imagine a fixture
Skip a paragraph, then develop a picture
Oo-wee, che-check out the brand new mixture
Artificial everything, sorry, Mister
How could you do your generical set-up?
And look faked up walkin the street lookin chopped up
Material's a thing you choose to get to strike a pose
Get cosmetic ears and get a cosmetic nose
No Siree, because you look wack, buddy
If looks were makin paper, you would be broke and ugly
Berries are suckin, yo, I wish you good luck
Walkin up the street and still your face looks fucked
Ain't no misbehavin, get outta here
You look like a ghost, alakazam, disappear
Go on, keep thinkin you're the cream of the crop
But what you need to be is cremated by the beauty shop

He-he-he-ha-ha-ha...

[ VERSE 1 ]
Daddy's little girl, but not the girl that daddy knew
Daddy never had a clue of what his little girl would do
A drifter, swift to open up and get with ya
A pocket full of dreams, as for my love - forget ya
I never concentrated on the fact that I'm loved, scheme for scheme
And things that would lead me to a pipe dream
Picture it, yes, I'm daddy's little girl
I never asked for nothin, now it's a string of pearls
My chances are thin, could I win with a substance?
A princess with a smile, but my sweetness was sort of grim
I never fought the feelin that I had to be wild
Cause in my mind I was a mature child
But I could't hurt daddy, I played the role
But on the sneak tip, I was massagin his soul
Nikki had to be free, you see, I had to be me
Or life just wouldn't flow through correctly
Being daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 2 ]
Daddy'd always tuck me in bed and kiss me goodnight
Said, ""Nikki, sleep tight,"" then turn off the light
And when he goes away on a business trip
I flip, lose my grip - party time - ah shit!
Tell the girls, split the duty, one go pick up the booze
My other half, move your ass and go spread the news
The party went on, lasted all night long
Song after song (to the break of dawn)
Then watch some nasty porns in the morn'
My body got warm, hmm - from gettin freaky with Vaughn
Sexin like crazy, my body amazed me
By takin a chance with a man that didn't faze me
A night so hectic, a bit unexpected
Before I made love, I shoulda been protected
Cause now I'm in a jam with this careless punk
And in about 3 months my stomach will be plump
Trouble, yes, I'm in the hot seat now
Tell my pops? No way, no how
It'll break his heart, wreck his whole world
To have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 3 ]
Neighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me
Cause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me
But there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings
So I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things
Sort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew
Every time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues
Now I regret the day that daddy let me out to play
But I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way
Daddy's little girl

But I'm daddy's little girl",Daddy's Little Girl,1991

Damned if I'll be good, I turn this track to a gangster
And roll up on the bitties who are jokes and pranksters

Reaching for just one touch
But then it's not enough
I feel this is wrong
Or is this where I belong

[Chorus]
Deep in the heart of fire
In ashes I would find you
Descending for your fall
Oh, I will meet you there
Deep in your darkest night
With ashes burning around you
With patience on your shoulder
Till you know I'm there

Sometimes I can't control
Emotions overflow
Before I even choose
I do what I don't want to do

You are just like a fire
With blazing colors
I can see your sense of grace
Impossible to embrace

[Chorus]

You make me reckless
You make me feel right
I feel heat
And I want it to be mine
Oh, patience

[Chorus: x2]",Patience,2000
Nikki Hassman,"Tell me
How many restless feet
Have walk these empty streets?
Hearts hazily sacrificed
For an uninspired life
I search for inspiration
A spark to stir my soul

[Chorus]
In your love I am free
Oh, you rapture me
In your eyes I escape
This lonely place
Oh, you rapture me

Oh, the skies blue are here
The sunlight shines away my fear
I've learned to believe
Cause you have taken me
From the cold and disillusion
Into the light of day

Awaked, I dream more than I can believe
I was blind, but now I see, oh, how you freed me

Nikki Jean,"He said: ""I write what I see
Write to make it right, don't like where I be
I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy""
See: now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook and a Bic
That click when it's pushed and a wack-ass beat
That's a track that's weak that he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like: ""That's that heat!""
A bass-heavy medley with a sample from the 70s
With a screwed-up hook that went ""stack that cheese""
Something something something, ""stack that cheese""
Mother, sister, cousin, ""stack that cheese""
He couldn't think of nothin', ""stack that cheese""
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and place to sleep
That plus a black Cadillac on Ds
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC

One you never heard of, I
Push it hard to further the
Grind, might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop you saved my life

Reps North-side, so he rocks them braids
1100 friends on his Myspace page
""Stack That Cheese"" got 700 plays
Producer made him take it down, said he had to pay
Open mic champ 2 weeks in a row
Ex d-Boy with a b-boy flow
Glow like Leroy, you should see the boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the Row
Best homie in the grave, tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby-momma, who he really had to honor
Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda to
Drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon' take her to the Galleria
And buy everything but the mannequins, ya dig?

One you never heard of, I
Push it hard to further the
Grind, might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop you saved my life

His man called, said: ""your time might be now
They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it 2 times, say it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool
Man it feels good, when it happens like that
Two days from going back to selling crack, yessir",Hip-Hop Saved My Life,2007
Nikki Jean,"Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told them lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag; take the pennies out the drawer
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day yet listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots and black hat
He's gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then could get a soccer ball
That's what my commander says
How old? Well I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government wants me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still to young
This candy gives me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A McCar parade of the toys he made
And in shimmer shades who looks half his age
About half the size of the flags they waved
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off dead soldier hang a little loose
With AK-47 that they shooting into heaven
Like they trying to kill the Jetsons
They struggle little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, avoided of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words on their own graves
Think you gangsta popped a few rounds
These kids will come through and murder a whole town
And sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Imagine if I had to console
The family of those
Slayed that I slain on game consoles
I aim I hold, right trigger to squeeze
Press up and y one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silence she don't approve of violent games
She leaves resume activity
Start and blew hearts, with poor harsh wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the purses of murder work load
I tell him he work for
CIA with A
And operative, I operate this game all day
I hold a controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious, now keep on mind for online experience

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Nikki Jean,"Now bring it out
Like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum, Tara at Sarah's wedding
Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't well then you wicked
Such is life
Odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark greys, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals
Vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

How was your day, can I make what you say
What I wanna hear, cause I want you here
The hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort

They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like prolly in the eye
What of the chicken? what is it missin', is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And attention from its demise pulled all of the flavor from the fat
And made it flat and rather lifeless
Well there's a place that has a stunning [?]
And more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory?
Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me
Or was it slippin' like permission am I trippin' like Phil
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real, is it real, is it real
Ha, hah!

How at the date can I make you my break
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised to the heavens make [?] for
Our petite mort, our petite mort

So glad you're back, but not glad at that you're glad
Where is the glamor in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The attended years slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

How are your chains, do they make you behave
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace down from heaven to memories [?]

Mad at the world
In a voice of a man, with a bag of a girl
She just avoids the success
It’s what he said
Or what she said
Double entendre no matter how you play it
Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette
And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye
Then prepares to utter, what’s been a symbol in its side
Against the ticker take scene
In a Silver Lake dream
Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams
Shouts to afford sun with imitate beams
In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings

There was a man who wrote many things
But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, ""truth crushed to earth, would rise again”
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that
“Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies, forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future
And, behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above his own”
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr Martin Luther King
And Dr King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people
Is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed
We have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We thank you for what you’ve asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn’t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men’s lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined
To keep us from being exterminated
And we thank, the almighty, for the privilege of being here with my niece

Something for the hood and a whole lot of white songs

Don't attack that please
Can't find a job, you can rap at least
'Cause that's what I did, I was at that leg
Right out of high school, tryna stack that cheese
You was tryna do what? Tryna stack that cheese
You wanna flip burgers, wanna stack that cheese
Make American singles, wanna stack that cheese
Make everybody smile, tryna stack that cheese
Tryna do it for a while, tryna stack that cheese
Talking frequent flyer miles, how I stack that cheese
Tryna bundle up the money, tryna stack that cheese
Aye Stack, can we stack that please?

That’s the alpha and omega
That's the Vodka and the vomit
Why you playing soccer with the sonics
That's a iPod to the Amish
You should get involved with the honest
Where everything's honored like Elijah Muhammad
Mixed with a pint of

I would treat the box like a sneaker head

Then drop it like a match on a gas trail
Fix another round for the mob
You the bomb
Let you heart you heart up and down to the door to the back fell
Still wanna put my meat up in your V like I'm Maxvell
Stick a fork in it, dawg, it's important to y'all
But it's porkin', so it ain't important at all

A silver lining just behind the darkest cloud
All the promise that I need to say out loud

I'm grateful for each minute, Lord, of walking in your light
Every moment is an opportunity
To dedicate myself to living all you have for me

Lord, help me to use what slips away

You see what He provides...

The pages of your past

We had vision but we didn't have sight
Can we forgive, so the whole world can live

But there is truth for those that hope and believe
Now I can see, that the greatest of these is love

The one in the mirror
And one that's been redeemed

Emancipate my soul
Forgive the sin in me
And make me whole

But I'm like a bird flying free
Then all of a sudden the old man awakens
And captures me
And then the good that I would
Is not what I do
When goodness is with me
Evil is too
So I come to you, Father, God, asking this of you

So many nights I've spent without sleep
I'm here across the sea
And you know it's killing me
Oh, you know
I miss you so.

There's been too many schemes
Too many, too many remedies
Too many broken, wasted years
But, I'm not shedding any tears,
Oh, no, no, no, no.

After I've had myself a good night's sleep

Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights
Been chasin' this for so long never has been fair fights
Lookin' for them rare sights. it's in there right?

The promiseland is real simply because I write it.
Don't stare too long and envy 'cause you might get eye-ritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices

Like this (like this) 
I'ma drink this henn, I'ma keep this grin, 
But if you look at nina closely I'm tryina contain this beast within.
I know some of y'all already knowin' that I got a lotta cheese to spend 
But that don't change the fact I go insane I gotta heap of sins please begin.

I saw a glimpse in all of this when I was just yay tall and I pictured y'all and it wall to wall but they all said I was just Delusional but the people startin' callin' us and I'm ballin' tough but the crawlin' rough and I never though of stuff with saw enough.
What the problem is now I got em here tellin' all these kids I'm the K.O.D and they pumpin up the volume and listenin' hard when I give my heart is it Delusional.
When I'm thinkin' I'ma boss in the biz but I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off in the lid but they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib

Some say that if tell them to hate my people are at the gate ready for sealin' your fate that is up for debate cause when I make my music ain't no evil from mister yates callin' me
A cult leader I don't really know but I'ma fosho heater wickedness commin' from mine rove they could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us at the bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na they say I lead em to evil like I was Jimmy Jones and feedin' the people when I bleed in the steeple the reason they seizin' me ain't no decreasin' my ego my powers for good I think would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink but that would never happen I'm makin' it with the rappin' but they want me to collapse and when I could I sink

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like we offer up confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to read alibi.
Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to do wrong hear me!

She feel like I'm, gonna make them hate because I was around and kick it and make them babys and now that I made it gotta escape them daily and that's crazy cause all I'm doin' is makin' the industry pay me but when I show my face feelin' everything's great did a show then we ate then I'm outta that state she said I'm a good provider but daddy of the year man I'm outta that race how I compensate for the losses they get often dates that's too personal we'll stop the tape

To let me know you made it home 
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 
If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights 
To let you know tonight's the night 
For me and you my part-time lover 
We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers 
But if there's some emergency 
Have a male friend to ask for me 
So then she won't peep its really you my part-time lover

I've got something that I must tell 
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
And it was not you my part-time lover

I ain't goin' other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team

[Verse 1]
I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song I'll write a hook for you
11:30 at night I ain't gonna look for you
Cause I know you coming home with me
I will never stress you or make you feel misled
If you want to go to the movies I'll flip it instead
You don't pay me
I get this with my bread my bread
Cause you know my money ain't a thing a thing

If you trying to be out to the party I'll let you go
If you want be out with somebody that's when I show
You do as you please cause baby that's how you know that
There's no other place that I'd rather go
I ain't trying to be fussin' and fightin' up on yo' back

Nothing's changed 
I still love you, oh, I still love you 
Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love 

I was delayed, I was way-laid 
An emergency stop 
I smelt the last ten seconds of life 
I crashed down on the crossbar 
And the pain was enough to make a shy, bald, Buddhist reflect 
And plan a mass murder 
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never
Who said I'd lied because I never? 

I was detained, I was restrained 
And broke my spleen and broke my knee 
And then he really laced into me
Friday night in-out patients 
Who said I'd lied to her? 

Oh, who said I'd lied? Because I never, I never 
Who said I'd lied? Because I never 

And so I drank one 
It became four 
And when I fell on the floor
I drank more

Somebody told me that this rap shit was fun 
You get to smoke weed and hold big guns 
Stand on stage rockin' your Timbs wit your sons 
That's bullshit  yo I'm out to get these funds 

Yo, yo somebody told me that threw a hotter joint dies 
Could he see it? EPMD Aguilar recognize 
Niggas was stuck on Diggy before Biggie and Nas 
Test guy reported in The Source, even thought about ""Best Buys"" 
My twelve-bar Count Dracula wit lyrics spectacular 
Sippin' out of Coke and he's drinkin' terror daiquiris and chrome 
backwards 
Challenge any woman, balls nothing, rock the hardest 
Racoons rap with your soloists if artist 
Puttin' it down on the day nine thousand, that's a cell with stories to tell 
Off those cells we're livin' well 
In the nine-eight-off, country club plink off 
While you're way off, check all systems, it's time we take off 

[Chorus: x2]

Guns with banana clips, two Rolexes to master whips 
A point four-five under my armpit 
Another one in the glove compartment 
Money startin' shit, brand new shoes on spank shit 
Tek nines, after parties with mad dimes 
Bitches twist the vine, I'm high and the moon's mine 
We're out to get mines, on a regular 
On the south, probably took the dreaded predator's pirate treasure 
In the crib I bought the leather, plus a movie screen 
So my team can play Sega plus the gods in Vegas 
An ounce of weed in every type of flavor 
Bank accounts wit fat paper, a major player 'cause

Higgity-hardcore, sewer rats keep it raw 
Beach houses and more, puffin weed on Seymour 
Pliggity-plush carpets cover floors, on bus tours 
Chrome point forty-fours, diggity-diamonds on paws 
All my slick cats above the laws, higgity-hide records in stores 
Hit squad, second world tour 
Kiggity-cameras compass on doors, signin' autographs 
After, where? In corridors 
Figgity-fuck walls, I'm buildin', splittin' Dutches spillin'
Chillin' until these pilgrims start ice grillin' 
Figgity-frontin' hard like a villain, Das EFX'll make a killin' 
And grab the cheese up like Sicilians cos

Niklas Strömstedt,"Do kom till mej
Våren var som vackrast när do kom till mej
Och om jag vetat det jag vet nu när do fanns hos mej
Nu är det för sent.

Förälskade; satt vi på balkongen
Och berusade; vi delade en flaska till 
Och älskade varandra till sömns

Och när vi vaknade var rummet ljust
Och gatan utanför var lika full av liv och rörelse som jag
I en säng på tredje våningen drack vi te med mjölk och honung
Do hade en gitarr och jag spelade, do dansade

Den sommaren
Vi åkte ut på Lidingö och hem igen,
Körde på en fågel och begravde den nånstans vid en sjö

När hösten kom, 
Sa do att ""Nu känns det som det börjar om""
Men jag var bara tyst och tom när hösten kom och sommaren dog

Men det händer att jag går förbi 
Huset som do bodde I, det händer att jag ser dej då och då
Vi trodde att vi fattade, vi blundade och skrattade
Vi tog allting vi kunde få, jag undrar vad vi tänkte på

Den morgonen
Jag minns dej där I fönstret sista morgonen
Det hände något på natten, och på morgonen var allting förbi",Sista Morgonen,2002

And there were no shoes on his feet yea, yea

And what about the woman
Who walks the night alone
With no place to sleep yea, yea
And what about the child
With a broken heart
Through teary eyes that can't really see
All they need is a hand
Someone who understands
To listen to the cry that they make
Instead of walking on by
Take a look into their eyes
And help somebody find their way

[Chorus]

Just open your heart
'Cause there's someone out there
Who's needing you now

Is something that can't be replaced

On jouait les durs mais l'un sur l'autre
Tu sais qu'on pouvait compter

Fallait pas s'perdre de vue on s'voyait aux fêtes

Te dire combien tu comptais

Des pleures des larmes
Et des coeursbrisés Tu me manques fréro

Adiós no dije, hoy te los mando
Van uno, dos, tres, millón de besos
Pido que me perdones en brazos
Con Dios te ibas, mi ausencia en el velorio deambulaba
Heridas que no cierran, infancias que perduran
Momentos tristes viejos no llegan
A veces vivir cuesta duda, sin duda
Paso las noches enteras rezando implorándole a Dios
Que cuide y vele por ti, que este contigo cuando no estoy
Paso las noches enteras rezando implorándole a Dios
Que cuide y vele por ti, que este contigo cuando no esto",Ausencia,2002

In the times of 1791
During the French revolution
As the church of Salon tollet the bell
Seven soldiers were approaching

They were drunk from wine and victory
Marching their way home
When nature called an urgent stop
By the shadow
Of the dome

We were brothers in arms
With a mission in life
Standing on holy ground

But the church is just an implement
Of fear to push us round

""Under the oak lightning strikes in Cienne
Long centuries grabbed""

All in a flash of light ...
""Found shall die eye pierced by a spring
Doomed by destiny stabbed""
With picks and shovels we broke the piece
Of the tombstone never dared
As the locals gathering in fear

(As the locals gathering in fear
To meet again our seer)

Drinking from his scull

And Lord Mayor himself
Held his speech of rebuke
""Please, let the dead rest in peace""
Heard the prophet of Woe laugh and sing
""I gave you a fair warning""
""Under the oak lightning strikes in Cienne
Long centuries grabbed""

I warned you all ...
""Found shall die eye pierced by a spring
Doomed by destiny stabbed""
And later on next morning
By the break of dawn
As the sun of grace revealed it's righteous face
To witness seven soldiers die
A minor death just another stitch
In our violent history
To become my destiny

""Under the oak lightning strikes in Cienne

Deep in my destiny
Inside my darkest hour
I will fall, will I fall ?
Can you hear me ?

Your majesty, my King
This man is a master of spell
He spoke some words
He'll take advantage of you
There's a danger but you won't even see
In the morning I beg you
Never play ""live or die""
So I ask you, listen to me
Beware of this prophecy, oh yeah

Name he's the one who can cure your heal
You, tell you, show you the stars in the
Heavens, the earth goes round the sun

There was danger they sent him away
Traditional healing the knowledge he gained
Put to use for the poor, the sick and the lame
And those who were less than this man
Were frightened by all of the things that he knew
Could it be that his power was not of this time ?
Now you know his name
He will not bleed you like others
Try ways to save you from the pain
And the torture
To save you from the grave

Eat of the dead

The highest fulfillment of man
Is to become food for the crawling things
That burrow and slither in human flesh
Unceasing in mindless hunger
Remorseless undefiled by reason
The worms of the tomb they are pure

Their purity elevates them
Above the putrefying pride of our race

The destiny of man is merely to be
The nourishment of the worm
Yet their excrement bestows higher wisdom

From decay arises new life
Fill myself with that which rots
And I shall be reborn

By writhing upon my belly like a mindless worm
I shall rise up in awareness of truth
I gnaw upon my own decaying flesh
And my mind is forever purged of the corruption of faith

Believe in nothingness
There is no purpose in birth
No blessedness after death
Only oblivion

Eat of the dead

Nile,"Invoked in stone of epic proportion
Was his temple of pillars, magnificent colossal
Humbling all who entered its sacred halls

Yet now fallen to decay and ruin
Its past grandeur
Obscured by the cruelties of time

The priests of the temple
Dead, all dead and fallen to dust
Their undying whispers of despair
Echo amongst sand strewn
Broken paving stones

Desolation, desolation, the end of days
The glory of the gods
Is put out like a reed torch in the water
The roof of the house of Amun is fallen

The sun shall impede the beating of their hearts
And blind their eyes

Let the shades of my fathers curse their faces
Let the eye of Sekhmet send the violence of the sun
Down upon their heads

Let searing torrents of fire descend upon their brow
Let flames immolate their places of sleeping

Let the eye of Sekhmet cause their hearts to burst into flames
Let carnivorous dogs consume their entrails

As for mine enemies let their charred ashes be as discarded refuse
Lying forgotten in the desert, let their shades not rise again

Anoint my phallus with the blood of the fallen

Let my curses be heard, let my will be as Menthu the bull
Potent to create and savage to slay those whom I have cursed
Let my wrath be terrible and my vengeance unmerciful

And I shall become free
And with freedom acquire emptiness
With the mind cleansed and empty

There is the void known as despair
A gateway upon an emptiness endless and vast

In despair the language of the shadows is intelligible
In madness all sounds become articulate

Terror and despair they guide me
Into nightmares that follow one upon the other
Like windblown grains of sand

I have become as the wastelands
Of unending nothingness
Now shall the night things
Fill me with their whisperings
And the shadows reveal their wisdom

To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me

I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight

Well, here I am and who's to say
A better love you won't find today

My forbidden lover, I don't want no other

I fell in love and I didn't want to do it cause I knew
That your love wasn't true
You try to hide that sinister appearance and the lies
Whew, those alibis

You give your love to anyone who asks, yes you do
And I know that it's true
But still I care and I want to see you there
When I need, yes indeed, you are

Just let me love you, anytime and any place we dare
We'll just let them stare

Nile Rodgers,"Baby, I’m on the hunt
Baby, I got my target on you
Trouble, that’s what I want
And I’m gonna do
Just what I have to
Get your ass down to the front
Go on and roll it out, I dare you
Sorry I’m kinda drunk
But did you just say your game was brand new

No, I ain’t broken, but I need a fix
That satisfaction when I, I get my kicks
I’m up all night, I’m outta sight
Don’t turn on the light
'Cause I’m feeling so shady lately
Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
Where freaks like us can meet

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don’t stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I’m feeling so shady lately

Gonna go and get me a shot
Gonna knock it back, forget all my blues
Yeah, that really hits the spot
I’m feeling pretty fierce in my dancin’ shoes

No, I ain’t broken, but I need a fix
That satisfaction when I get my kicks
I’m up all night, I’m outta sight
Don’t turn on the light
'Cause I’m feeling so shady lately
Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
Where freaks like us can meet

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don’t stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I’m feeling so shady lately

I throw more shade than a cloudy day
The brakes don’t work, I’m just a runaway train
Somebody come and help me out,
All I wanna be is free
I was tryin’ to get down, now I can’t get out
I’m shady lately

Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
Where freaks like us can meet
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don’t stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out
'Cause I’m feeling so shady lately

Nile Rodgers,"My hope, your hand
We never falter - when times are hard, we’ll stride
And now, stand by
As others caution, what they don’t see as right

Never will they get in our way
Who knows what is right?
Never will they lead us astray
Who knows what is right?

It’s a risk worth taking
There’s no looking back
It’s not for frightening, and we face the facts
For mine is the darkness
Cold, the lights and ocean
When all that we work falls down to test of time

My hope, your hand
We never falter when times are hard, we’ll stride
And now, stand by
As others caution, what they don’t see as right

Never will they get in our way
Who knows what is right?
Never will they lead us astray
Who knows what is right?

I wrap the vines around your thighs
I can see the kind of tip you're on
There's no confusion in your eyes

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Taking sips to push the moment on
But it's just the bottle that's run dry
Lose the watch 'cause we got nothing on
And I'm not keeping track of time!
