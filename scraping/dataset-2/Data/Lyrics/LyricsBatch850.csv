Phoebe Snow,"You are my mantra, you are my prayer
My benediction, my conviction, my electric chair
My reaction, attraction
You expose my every layer

You're my poem on a cloudy day
Alabaster shores with palms that sway
A fleeting glance misread
And then I run away

You'll always be my inspiration
I love you from afar
Oh, my love, how beautiful
How beautiful we are, we are

You're my morning star, my wake up call
You are my trip, you are my fall, my fall

You are sacred ancient music
For the devil to deploy
Prying loose the dead bolt
To my heart's forgotten door

You'll always be my inspiration
I love you from afar
Oh, my love, how beautiful
How beautiful

You'll always be my inspiration
I love you from afar
Oh, my love, how beautiful
How pitiful we are, we are, we are

Beautiful we are
I love you
",How Beautiful,2003
Phoebe Snow,"Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes
The confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning crashes, old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes
The confusion that was hers
Belongs now to the baby down the hall

Oh, now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the Earth again
I can feel it

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes
Pale blue colored iris presents the circle
And puts the glory out to hide

Oh, now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the Earth again
I can feel it, I can feel it

Oh, now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the Earth again
I can feel it

Oh, now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the Earth again
I can feel it, I can feel it, feel it

Phoebe Snow,"Does she love me, with all her heart
should I worry, when we're apart
it's a lover's question, I'd like to know.

Does she need me, as she pretends
is this a game, well then will I win
it's a lover's question, I'd like to know

I'd like to know when she's not with me
if she's still true to me
I'd like to know when we're kissing
does she feel just what I feel,
and how am I to know it's really real.

Oh, tell me where, the answer lies
is it in her kiss or in her eyes
it's a lover's question I'd like to know.

Phoebe Snow,"Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game

All in the wonderful game
That we know as lies

You've had words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above

And once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game

Soon he'll be there by your side
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

You had words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart, your heart can rise above, oh oh oh oh oh

Phoebe Snow,"Make sense of the world when it’s upside down
Spinning so fast, but for some it just ends
Keep moving on quiet as kept
It hasn’t been long, hasn’t sunken in yet

Then I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
Separate like a puzzle floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life
So lost

There’s so many things we haven’t said
There’s so many places never went
Wish you could visit every now and then
Oh I keep pretending like I understand
Was it something that I could prevent?
Oh I miss you like a piece is gone
So lost

Cause I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
Never seeing you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life

So I rise and fall like the tide
And I’m so full and empty inside
All those memories linger in my mind
Wish you were here with me

I said I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again

Phoebe Snow,"I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall.
I wanna holler but the joint's too small.

I wanna kiss her but the gal's too tall.

Phoebe Snow,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart,2008
Phoebe Snow,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,2008
Phoebe Snow & The Jessy Dixon Singers,"The night was black, the roads were icy 
Snow was fallin', drifts were high
And I was weary from my driving
And I stopped to rest for awhile

I sat down at a truck stop
I was thinking about my past
I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

[Chorus]
Gone at last, gone at last 
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last
Oo, oo, oo... 

I ain't dumb
I kicked around some
I don't fall too easily 
But that boy looked so dejected 
He just grabbed my sympathy

Sweet little soul now, what's your problem?
Tell me why you're so downcast 
I've had a long streak of bad luck 
But I pray it's gone at last

[Chorus]

Once in a while from out of nowhere
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared
Somebody will come and lift you higher
And your burdens will be shared

Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you 
I might still be sinking fast
I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last

No way to handle things

Mamma, the weeping
Mamma, the Angels
No sleep in Heaven

Still, there's this one thing: just to see you go by
It's almost like lovin', sad as that is

May not be cool, but it's so where I live

It's like I'm your lover, or more like your ghost—
I spend the day wonderin' what you do, where you go
THEA
I try and just kick it, but then what can I do?
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you

See us winter walkin' after a storm
It's chill in the wind, but it's warm in your arms
We stop, all snow-blind, may not be true
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you

Well you'll have to excuse me, I know it's so off
I love when you do stuff that's rude and so wrong

I go up to my room, turn the stereo on
Shoot up some you, and the ""you"" is some song

And play out these scenes (These scenes)
I ride on the rush (The rush)

Phoebus,"Belle
C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Belle
Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô Notre-Dame!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Belle
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir menée jusqu'à l'autel
Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Ô Fleur-de-Lys!
Je ne suis pas homme de foi
J'irai cueillir la fleur d'amour d'Esmeralda

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre

Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control

They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that' s fading away

You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try

No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait

Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number

I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away

In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start

To be brilliant or superior

I'm in league with the foe

It's too sinister

Come buy a ticket
To your next vacation
There's only one around you
That does the stitching

So call me, call me, call me
Back if you wait
Forget the mess behind you
Forgot the lesson

Stop, what you with your lifetime
It's only protocol

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here

He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon

I've been around, seen some things, sexed a lot of girls
I did my time but in my mind, I'm still thinking it's my world

I got my finger on the pulse of this music shit, I'm the truest
Now tell me who this sick and you can swallow everything
That's coming through this dick

Reignin King of the boom bap
Bomb strapped to my chest askin ""Where ya goons at?""
I'm old school like a StarTac
On a voyage like Star Trek, me unemployed is far fetched
I'm hot, I got corduroy flow
You can picture but can't shake it, the Polaroid show
I book niggas for shows and put niggas in comas
So I hope that you niggas is roamers
Cause my niggas is Ryders like Winona
But we just tryna have a good time like Willona
I'm a zoner, all I do is zone out
Like a stoner as far away as Estonia
I'm a sucker for a good sucking, so tell ya bitch
That's it's best if she investing with this good lucking
Mami, would you rather fly over niggas heads?
Or keep your ass in the hood ducking?

I've been around, seen some things, sexed a lot of girls
I did my time but in my mind, I'm still thinking it's my world

Now tell me who this sick and you can swallow everything
That's coming through this dick

Pardon my French, talk English
Steal your job, the discount is the five fingers
That's why Preme is the head, not king
My drive's on my toes, I got my Bedrock swing
Street Hop is a culture, I rock with the vultures
To make bread with the opposite toaster
I'm Py-reckless, I'm kitchen, equip sickening
And my neckless is glistening, it's expensive
So don't mention your ice whenever you mention my rhymes
Cause my pencil is priceless
So what you running for? Nigga I'm coming for you
If I'm the hyphen, then you the underscore
True and I'm lawless packing
I ain't no designer but I got a flawless jacket
Whoa, after ""Boom,"" this afternoon
It's night-night, when me and Preme come back for more

I've been around, seen some things, sexed a lot of girls
I did my time but in my mind, I'm still thinking it's my world

I got my finger on the pulse of this music shit, I'm the truest
Now tell me who this sick and you can swallow everything

Phonte,"When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up
I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning Js, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And made it today, I'll restart fresh and new

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day",The Day,2010

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'm-a get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never, now or never, now or never)

I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain
Tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change
Finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done
My head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page
To start acting my age and part ways
With black thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase--bygones is bygones?
Niggas who used to be the underdog is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this mid-life kind of crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now, but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead--which is my look-a-like now
I'm moving ahead

[Chorus]

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew 'em
On the sunniest days of my life I cried through 'em
Mom's was out the picture and pops I barely knew him
And I would pray to God, but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam' and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?
My mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
I know my good and bad needs both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role was cast before I even auditioned for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reclamation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering
You can go ahead throw the towel in
'Cause, nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the lights
Like (?) it's the end of your life
And I'm out

[Chorus]

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feels like there's something else far off in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger take and leaving less of me
I can't fight it now; I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in (?)
Or will it just start bringing out the best of me?
But is the best of me really just the worst of me?
And if so yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinners' court it's important to have church with me 
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I feel that change is an absolute certainty
'Cause what's going on is a state of emergency

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool

I don't know what else to say

I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation

If too much money talking
We make em economize
Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a
Kam-I-Ka-Ze pilot
We wilin' out of control until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con
Feared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y’all streets
Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best

Turn around and walk away
I wish a nigga could

Weak heartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like the samurai
The street’s Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck
I’ve been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it’s a smash and grab
And where my party people y’all finna have a blast
You say goodbye, I say hello first and last
Hello hello, Now all of y’all elevate your glass
To an example of what time will do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects-usual, coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time
Then I went missing looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line un-rhymed

You ever wonder what’s the big fuss
For everyone be on time
What’s the big deal, why do they feel
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky and if I’d ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

I wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then drive in head first like the jack knife
Cause out here, yo you niggas can’t belly flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
One time means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one time
The pendulum swinging my way, couldn’t be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
Cause we all going down just like the sub prime
Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Then through the alley way and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets
A life of high crime
To make it to the bottom
Such a high climb

There's one thing I got to know

Sometimes took this life for granted
Never called you by your name
Always tried to live right by you

That's just too much pain to bear
Trading on my life's ambitions

Begging, please God give him shelter
When the rain begins to fall
Shine your light on him for guidance
When his back's against the wall

I will feel the fire burning
See, I'm in the darkest night
Almost taste the air he's breathing
Hear the whispers of his thoughts

Always made my own decisions
Never cared for reasons why

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was bailin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said “It was a shame about Billie Joe, anyhow”
“Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good on Choctaw Ridge”
“And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.”

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it just don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, stopped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers on Choctaw Ridge
I throw them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

My kind we fight in the club
I mix up that vodka with the chronic and I feel that love
I dream I work I bleed
I say things that I don't really mean
I'm not into Jail-bait but my girlfriends only seventeen
Can I hit that can I rip that can I lick that Can I get that from behind
I'm murdering and stabbing so much vag I'm wanted for vagaside
I'm living a life of sin, no I don't have any friends
Now the rain is coming and I'm running from myself again

I feel this darkness coming over me
It's taking over me
Now you can rest in pieces
By the time the sun goes down
Now nigga you can rest in pieces

Let's ride yeah everybody gonna die
Fuck the world nigga ain't nobody getting out alive
Let's ride motherfucker we all gonna die
We already dead ain't nobody getting out

I paint a picture that's perfect so you can see what I'm saying
I state it perfectly clearly so that you know I ain't playing
Cause I don't give a fuck about you or that shit that you're saying
Because you caught up in the matrix you blind you sleeping homie
I dream I work I bleed I say things that I don't really mean
But mostly when I drink too much and I'm smoking too much kush and
I'm under too much pressure I think I think too much
I can't find my piece of mind I feel like I'm losing touch

I feel this darkness coming over me
I can't take it I can't escape all this hating
It's my turn I'm retaliating now
By the time the sun goes down
I know you feel me nigga, you feel me nigga

Now I won't stop I just rock and I battle your whole clique
You a homo you a trick silly faggot ass bitch
I exposed that dirty bitch for the hoe that she is
Make her cry, make her thighs twitch then cum on her tits
I'm a rock I'm a roll I'm a shock to your soul
When I flow niggas know I'm like Malcolm come on though
Every note that I wrote will make you jump out your throat
On that high oh so high so I don't know where the time goes

I try to do right and I can't figure out
Why I get schizo and psycho I go Jeckle to Hyde
It's these voices inside it's that darkness above me
Makes me turn away from good to bad then to ugly
That's why drugs seem so lovely like a way to escape
All this ugliness above me how much more can we take
Till we break and we take back the world from these fake motherfuckers

Phyllis Hyman,"Someone to love
Someday I?ll finally find the man I dreamed about
He?ll be the love that touched my heart and turned my feelings inside out
It's been so long and I grow tired of being all alone

Am I asking for too much?
All I want is someone I can touch
Why must it take so long to find someone to love?

I tried to lose myself and fool myself
Hide myself in someone?s arms
I tried to make believe I had it all
But deep inside I always knew
That lovers who pretend lose out in the end

No matter how long it may take
I know the difference and I?ll wait for someone to love

Ooh, someone to love
Someone to love, someone to love
Whose beauty lies within their sensitivity
I?ll walk with hope and I?ll hold on
Until the day shall come along

Am I asking for too much?
All I want is love that I can touch
Why must it take so long to find ooh, someone to love?

Oh, oh, oh, somebody to love

Phyllis Newman,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,
Phyllis Robins,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true, 
I of course replied, something here inside cannot be denied. 
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind, 
When your heart's on fire, you must realize, 

Smoke gets in your eyes. 
So I chaffed and then I gaily laughed, 
To think that they could doubt my love, 
Yet today, my love has flown away, 

I am without my love. 
Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide, 
So I smile and say when a lovely flame dies, 
Smoke gets in your eyes",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,1996
Phyllis Taylor Sparks,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song,1995

Pack up, I'm strapped up, I got this, I promise
I think this is what they make back-up for
This is my score
Let me put something on the board
Your hand me down handicap secondhand trouble
That you try to juggle
You need a hand, hand me that
I'll hold the duffel, you shovel
I love you like blood do
Sea your shell scuffle and triumph
I beach your demons, now wipe off your sandy back
Shore, we fall, but standing back to back
I can't evacuate you in this situation
Tie your shoelace, I fall behind
You wait for, it's your boy
Got your forevermore
Rest your poor, bruised body and relax, score!

I know you know it, you know it
But you can't go choosing sides
But if you just show it, let me know it

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

You can see a distant steeple

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Piccadilly Theatre Orchestra,"Verse 1
 
 The India that one read about
 And may have been misled about
 In one respect has kept itself intact.
 Though ‘Pukka Sahib' traditions may have cracked
 And thinned
 The good old Indian army's still a fact.
 That famous monumental man
 The Officer and Gentleman
 Still lives and breathes and functions from Bombay to Katmandu
 At any moment one can glimpse
 Matured or embryonic ‘Blimps'
 Vivaciously speculating as to what became of who.
 Though Eastern sounds may fascinate your ear
 When West meets West you're always sure to hear-
 
 Refrain 1
 
 Whatever became of old Bagot?
 I haven't seen him for a year.
 Is it true that young Forbes had to marry that Faggot
 He met in the Vale of Kashmir?
 Have you had any news
 Or that chap in the “Blues”,
 Was it Prosser or Pyecroft or Pym?
 He was stationed in Simla, or was it Bengal?
 I know he got tight at a ball in Nepal
 And wrote several four-letter words on the wall.
 I wonder what happened to him!
 
 Refrain 2
 
 Whatever became of old Shelley?
 Is it true that young Briggs was cashiered
 For riding quite nude on a push-bike through Delhi
 The day the new Viceroy appeared?
 Have you had any word
 Of that bloke in the ‘Third',
 Was it Southerby, Sedgwick or Sim?
 They had him thrown out of the club in Bombay
 For, apart from his mess bill exceeding his pay,
 He took to pig-sticking in quite the wrong way.
 I wonder what happened to him!
 
 Verse 2
 
 One must admit that by and large
 Upholders of the British Raj*
 Don't shine in conversation as a breed.
 Though Indian army officers can read
 A bit
 Their verbal wit-has rather run to seed.
 Their splendid insularity
 And roguish jocularity
 Was echoing through when Victoria was Queen.
 In restaurants and dining-cars,
 In messes, clubs and hotel bars
 They try to maintain tradition in the way it's always been.
 Though worlds may change and nations disappear
 Above the shrieking chaos you will hear-
 
 Refrain 3
 
 Whatever became of old Tucker?
 Have you heard any word of young Mills
 Who ruptured himself at the end of a chukka
 And had to be sent to the hills?
 They say that young Lees
 Had a go of ‘D.T.'s'
 And his hopes of promotion are slim.
 According to Stubbs, who's a bit of a louse,
 The silly young blighter went out on a ‘souse',
 And took two old tarts into Government House.
 I wonder what happened to him!
 
 Refrain 4
 
 Whatever became of old Keeling?
 I hear that he got back from France
 And frightened three nuns in a train in Darjeeling
 By stripping and waving his lance!
 D'you remember Munroe,
 In the P.A.V.O?
 He was tallish and mentally dim.
 The talk of heredity can't be quite true,
 He was dropped on his head by his ayah at two,
 I presume that by now he'll have reached G.H.Q.
 I'm sure that's what happened to him!
 
 Refrain 5
 
 Whatever became of old Archie?
 I hear he departed this life
 After rounding up ten sacred cows in Karachi
 To welcome the Governor's wife.
 D'you remember young Phipps
 Who had very large hips
 And whose waist was excessively slim?
 Well, it seems that some doctor in Grosvenor Square
 Gave him hormone injections for growing his hair
 And he grew something here, and he grew something there.
 I wonder what happened to her-him?

True to the breed that that bore him,

When you go down to the sea

For a year and a day you may sail away
And have no thought of me,
Yet through the wind and the spray you will hear me say
No love was ever free.

You will sigh when horizons are clear,
Something that is dear to me
Cannot let me be,

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot 
When you go down to the sea.

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart will follow
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

When there's grief in the sky and the waves ride high
My heart to yours will say
You may be sure that I'm true to my love for you
Though half the world away.

Never mind if you find other charms,
Here within my arms you'll sleep,

Pickettywitch,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2001

Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold

Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.

Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;

Runs straight and high.

I've come to talk with you again,

Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say

Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

And I hope I get to see him again.
Cause we'll eat some coffee heath bar.

But they've been missing so I keep the view.
Some feed us lines, try to deceive
But we won't believe them cause we seek what's true.

And talk some sense with me.

And you'd be left behind.

Hold your breath,
Dream that you're underwater.
Eyes closed, all relaxed,
Sinking and soaking wet.
And if you need the lights on
Don't get scared,
Take a walk to find a lamp post,
Dear, acquaint yourself with all that's living there.

There is still far to go.
There is still far to go.
There is still far to go.
It goes on, and on, and on.

So what you came to do
Will never be done.
All the weird stuff happening,
Who do you listen to?
Not attractive, but passive.
You wanna attack, but need someone to go first.

And if you've reached exhaustion,
Just stay in bed
Getting out may get you nowhere.

What have I become? 
In a quest for purity, I've become stained, my motives twisted and lost in my ambitions. 
Through the eyes of angels, I saw a world of chances. on the thorns of decadence my wings were torn. my wings were torn.

Pieces of a Dream,"I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow

Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

We can make it if we try

Building castles in the sky

On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew

You're doing. Just stop.
You know, they say there' s beauty
in the eyes which I say is not the fact.
'Cause you are as beautiful as your
thoughts, right on.

You know, for instance, we study all kin
kinds of sciences, astrogy, mysticism,
religion, so forth we did.
And like coming from here place, all these things help
because if you're inside your inner self
Have mercy!

Now. there's an outer self we got to deal with
the one that likes to go to parties,
one that likes to dress up and be cool
and look pretty, all ego-trips avel all this.

Hear you all, I'm trying to tell you,
you gotta love you. And learn all the beautiful things around you,
trees and birds. And if there ain't no beauty,
you got to make some beauty. Have mercy!

About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet!

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time

You know we be
Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups

Honies show me love

I'm dancin' with a nice honey
And her friend
One on the back and one on the front
Shakin' it up, shakin' it up

Takin' it down, taking it down
I love the way you snake it
You got the best of me

Doing what you're doing
Up in the VIP

Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle

Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Pierangelo Bertoli,"E l'acqua si riempie di schiuma, il cielo di fumi 
La chimica lebbra distrugge la vita nei fiumi 
Uccelli che volano a stento, malati di morte 
Il freddo interesse alla vita ha sbarrato le porte 

Un'isola intera ha trovato nel mare una tomba 
Il falso progresso ha voluto provare una bomba 
Poi pioggia che toglie la sete alla terra che è viva 
Invece le porta la morte perché è radioattiva 

Eppure il vento soffia ancora 
Spruzza l'acqua alle navi sulla prora 
E sussurra canzoni tra le foglie 
E bacia i fiori, li bacia e non li coglie 

Un giorno il denaro ha scoperto la guerra mondiale 
Ha dato il suo putrido segno all'istinto bestiale 
Ha ucciso, bruciato, distrutto in un triste rosario 
E tutta la terra si è avvolta di un nero sudario 

E presto la chiave nascosta di nuovi segreti 
Così copriranno di fango persino i pianeti 
Vorranno inquinare le stelle, la guerra tra i soli 
I crimini contro la vita li chiamano errori 

Eppure il vento soffia ancora 
Spruzza l'acqua alle navi sulla prora 
E sussurra canzoni tra le foglie 
E bacia i fiori li bacia e non li coglie 

Eppure sfiora le campagne 
Accarezza sui fianchi le montagne 
E scompiglia le donne fra i capelli 
Corre a gara in volo con gli uccelli 

Eppure il vento soffia ancora",Eppure Soffia,2002

Buona pesca ci sarà
E canta le tue canzoni

Con Dio di te parlò

Dimmi dimmi mio Signore
Dimmi che tornerà
L'uomo mio difendi dal mare
Dai pericoli che troverà

Scaccialo dalla mia mente

E una rosa egli mi ha dato
Una rosa lui mi ha dato
Rosa rossa pegno di amore
Rosa rossa malaspina
Nel silenzio della notte ora

No per Dio non farlo tornare

Pesca non ti fermare

È così cattiva poi la morte

Dimmi dimmi mio Signore
Dimmi che tornerà
Quell'uomo che sento l'uomo mio
Quell'uomo che non saprà
Che non saprà di me
Di lui e delle sue promesse vane
Di una rosa rossa qui tra le mie dita
Di una storia nata già finita
Di una storia nata già finita

Pesca non ti fermare
Poco pesce nella rete

Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower-power
But underneath
We had a fear of flying
Of growing old
A fear of slowly dying
We took our chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all

In the tourist jam

Round the Notre Dame

Our last summer

Morning croissants

Living for the day
Worries far away

And thanks for all the fun

There's no hurry any more

Pierce Pettis,"It is a legacy
It was handed down to me
Poor dirt farmer
Skinny mule

Parched the red clay
Like it was the Red Sea
It is a legacy
Both me and You

You are a black man
I am a white man
Both come from southland
Both doing the best we can

Well the grim reaper
Is my brother's keeper
The way my brother was kept
Small wonder Jesus wept

Is it a legacy
Passed down to you and me
What we're taught to believe
We never question these things

It is a legacy
It's a wild and bitter seed
Blown across those fertile fields
Where the roots run deep

Both got calloused hands
Blue collared working men
Down here in Bubba land
What's in a name

Both living rent to rent
Some owe the government
We are quite different
We are the same

It is a legacy
Passed down to you and me
What we learn to believe
We never question these things

It is a legacy
A wild and bitter seed
Blown across those fertile fields
Where the roots run deep

Sundays we congregate
Praise Jesus, pass the plate
Sitting in our Sunday best
Singing hymns and wiping sweat

We learn the golden rule
In separate Sunday schools
Our house long divided against itself

It is a legacy
Passed down to you and me
What we choose to believe
We dare not question these things

It is a legacy
It is a wild and bitter seed
Scattered on those fertile fields
Where the roots run deep

Pierce Pettis,"This is how it seems to me 
Life is only therapy 
Real expensive 
And no guarantee 
So I lie here on the couch 
With my heart hanging out 
Frozen solid with fear 
Like a rock in the ground 
Woman you move me 
You give me courage I didn't 
know I had 
You move me on 
I can't go with you 
And stay where I am 
So you move me on 
This is how love was to me 
I could look and not see 
Going through the emotions 
Not knowin' what they mean 
And it scared me so much 
That I just wouldn't budge 
I might have stayed there forever 
If not for your touch 
Oh but you move me 
Out of myself and into the fire 
You move me 
Now I'm burning with love 
And with hope and desire 
How you move me 
You go whistling in the dark 
Making light of it 
Making light of it 
And I follow with my heart 
Laughing all the way 
Oh 'cause you move me 
You get me dancing and you 
make me sing 
You move me

In every little thing

It's a great big sky
It's a great big love for you

It's a great big world
It's a great big moon
It's a great big sky
It's a great big love for you

Then I tell you a story of a lion who's your best friend
He gets you into trouble but he brings you home safe in the end

Seasons turn like traffic lights
Like some fine flashing thing just outside whisperin'
Hold on, boy, you're gonna need this memory

I've seen baby hands reach out
Grab my fingers like a vise, grab my glasses
Grab my keys, grab my heart by the strings
Hold on, boy, you're gonna need this memory

If all I got for all my trouble
Is just a box of souvenirs
Still it's worth a lot just to remember
Just to know that I was here

Lovers smile from photographs of endless summers by the sea
Still hear old friends joke and laugh
From the past they call to me
Saying, ""Hold on boy, you're gonna need this memory""

If all we got for all our trouble
Is just this box of souvenirs
Still it's worth a lot just to remember
Just so we know that we were here

I think I know just what you mean

And call it love for the last time
My darling never rest
Until the darker gets
The best of all we had
Can the cold carry on

When the light means nothing to you
Then no one would know
The sound of a ghost
And I might be perfect with you

Is something still scaring you

Oh, I try
But I can't calm down

Are doing the very best they can

Before it dies on the display

Gonna break down
Break down the better side of me
The better side of me
Well I know, I know
If I die young

Then we can wake up screaming in your bed
And our lungs are begging us to calm down
And I scare myself with all that talk of severing
Doing the best or so it seems
You've been mistaken

Your finger is on the scale
Burn like you never have before
Stop, drop and roll don't work in hell
So what if I forget regret
So what if I
So what if I forget regret
I want you to know that I
That I've wrote this line a thousand times Forget regret
This must be the way it ends

Smile for me

And if there's a God
Then I'm letting Him go

And bury the empty cup

When I sew you up
Don't let me stop bleeding
Tiny stitches that you placed into my skin
Won't let me go, oh no, oh no
And they're ruining the mood
So I'll toast every beat of my heart like a miracle

Meglio là che in culo al mondo
Meglio niente di secondo
Che nessuna libertà

Ogni scelta ha un costo
Ogni dio ha un cielo, quindi
Ogni sogno ha un posto
Fino a che

Pierre,"You go where you want
You do what you please
Never let on, that even once
That you've ever been lonely
It's nice to see you alone
Are you lookin' for somethin'
Maybe you ain't gettin' at home?
 
Your hair is in place
You're dressin' to kill
Your old man has promised
When he died he would leave you his money
And the pool where you swim
Are you lookin' for somethin'
Maybe you ain't gettin' from him?
 
Steppin' out, steppin' out
To get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out
The day time queen takes a midnight ride
 
And it's plain as plain can be
You're a woman who wants to get free
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,
Come on and step out with me
 
The party's a bore
It's bound to get worse
Let's sneak out somewhere
And engage in our own celebration
Will you pour me some wine?
Are you thinkin', baby, maybe
Your needs are the same as mine?
 
Wanna go for a walk,
Go for a ride,
Maybe just stand here and think
What we can do to each other
No, we don't have to dance
If you're thinkin' of steppin' out
Baby, this is your chance
 
Steppin' out, steppin' out
To get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out
The day time queen takes a midnight ride
 
And it's plain as plain can be
You're a woman who wants to get free
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,
Come on and step out with me

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

La terre c'était le charbon
Le ciel c'était l'horizon
Les hommes des mineurs de fond

Nos fenêtres donnaient sur des fenêtres semblables
Et la pluie mouillait mon cartable
Et mon père en rentrant avait les yeux si bleus
Que je croyais voir le ciel bleu
J'apprenais mes leçons, la joue contre son bras
Je crois qu'il était fier de moi
Il était généreux comme ceux du pays
Et je lui dois ce que je suis

Au nord, c'étaient les corons
La terre c'était le charbon
Le ciel c'était l'horizon

Et c'était mon enfance, et elle était heureuse
Dans la buée des lessiveuses
Et j'avais des terrils à défaut de montagnes
D'en haut je voyais la campagne
Mon père était ""gueule noire"" comme l'étaient ses parents
Ma mère avait les cheveux blancs
Ils étaient de la fosse, comme on est d'un pays
Grâce à eux je sais qui je suis

Au nord, c'étaient les corons
La terre c'était le charbon
Le ciel c'était l'horizon
Les hommes des mineurs de fond

Y avait à la mairie le jour de la kermesse
Une photo de Jean Jaurès
Et chaque verre de vin était un diamant rose
Posé sur fond de silicose
Ils parlaient de 36 et des coups de grisou
Des accidents du fond du trou
Ils aimaient leur métier comme on aime un pays
C'est avec eux que j'ai compris

Y en a qui vous parl’nt de l’Amérique,
Ils ont des visions de cinéma ;
Ils vous dis’nt "" Quel pays magnifique ""
Notre Paris n’est rien auprès d’ça.
Ces boniments-là rend’nt moins timide,
Bref, l’on y part, un jour de cafard…
Ca f’ra un d’plus qui, le ventre vide,
L’soir à New York cherch’ra un dollar
Au milieu des gueus’s, des proscrits,
Des émigrants aux cœurs meurtris ;
Il pens’ra , regrettant Paris :

R.
Où est-il mon Moulin d’la Plac’ Blanche ?
Mon tabac et mon bistro du coin ?
Tous les jours étaient pour moi Dimanche !
Où sont-ils les amis, les copains ?
Où sont-ils tous mes vieux bals musette ?
Leur javas au son d’l’accordéon ?
Où sont-ils tous mes r’pas sans galette ?
Avec un cornet d’frites à dix ronds
Où sont ils donc ?

2.
D 'antres croyant gagner davantage.
Font des rêves d'or encore plus beaux
Pourquoi risquer un si long voyage
Puisque Paris est plein de gogos ?
On monte une affaire colossale,
Avec l'argent du bon populo,
Mais un jour, crac ...c'est le gros scandale :
Monsieur couch’ra ce soir au dépôt !
Et demain on le conduira
Pour dix années à Nouméa.
Encor un de plus qui dira :

Mais Montmartre semble disparaître 
Car hélas de saison en saison 
Des Abbesses à la Place du Tertre,
On démolit nos vieilles maisons. 
Sur les terrains vagues de la butte 
De grandes banques naîtront bientôt, 
Où ferez-vous alors vos culbutes,
Vous, les pauvres gosses a Poulbot ?

Nous chant'rons songeant à Salis,

Les peintres en bâtiment
Sont des bons gars généralement
Ils chantent en barbouillant
Leurs murailles en jaune ou en blanc
Parmi tous ces braves gens
Y en a un cependant
Qui a bien tout du fou
C'est un grand méchant loup !

Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Il travaille du pinceau
Il a, comme dirait ma sœur
La folie des grandeurs
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! 
Il travaille du pinceau
Il s' gonfle, il s' prend pour Attila
Bien sûr qu'il en crèvera
Tra la la la la la !
Sous les roses

Il a une maladie 
Plus grave que l'aérophagie
Paraît qu' ça lui fait mal
Il appelle ça «l'espace vital»
Quand il se sent rétrécit
il fronce les sourcils
Et éclate de fureur
Il bave que ça fait peur

Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Il travaille du pinceau
Alors, il rentre chez les voisins
Il fauche tout sur son chemin
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! 
Il travaille du pinceau
Un jour, il tombera sans plus de phrases
Sur un beau bec de gaz
Tra la la la la la la !
Sous les roses

Il ne boit que de l'eau
Il ne mange que des haricots
Il n'a pas de parents
Il n'a ni femme, ni enfant
Il lui manque l'honneur
Il lui manque le cœur
Il lui manque, à ce qu'on dit
Même autre chose aussi

Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Il lui manque le pinceau
Il n’aime personne, pas d'amis
En bref, il n'aime que lui
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Il lui manque le pinceau
Y se plait tout seul, il se trouve beau
Moi, je préfère Charlot
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Sous les roses

Mais le peintre en question
N'est pas un gars de notre région
Il est de ce pays
Qui nous a donné avant lui
Un vampire étrangleur
Et puis Weidmann, le tueur
Qui n'étaient que des gamins
Auprès de ce coquin

Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Il travaille du pinceau
Il a besoin ce gros soufflé
D'être un peu dégonflé
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh !
Mais il le s'ra bientôt
Et nous graverons sur son tombeau

J'irai jusqu'à toi",J'Irai Tranquille,1995
Pierre Drevet,"Regarde la sphère elle tournera
Sans qu´on soit là
Dis toi ça et tu verras

Le grand manège, c´est fait pour ça
Pour que la neige fonde au soleil tu verras

Même quand les arbres n´ont plus de branches
Quand sous la tempête ils penchent
Ils restent forts ils restent droits

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter

Regarde moi et sourie moi
Bientôt crois moi, bientôt la roue tournera
C´est toi qui me consolerais
C´est toi qui me diras ne t´en fait pas
Car l´essentiel tu l´as au fond de toi

Même quand les arbres n´ont plus de branches
Quand sous la tempête ils penchent
Ils restent forts ils restent droits

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter",Laisse Pleurer Les Nuages,1995
Pierre Drevet,"Dans mon jardin secret y a des fleurs immortelles
Des soucis des pensées des racines éternelles
Y a des arbres écorchés par des serments gravés
Et deux trois réverbères qui m´éclairent sur hier

L´allée de mon immeuble qui voulait voir le jour
Le couloir vers ma chambre trop étroit pour danser
L´église au toit pointu qui orientait ma vue
Vers un tout p´tit bout de ciel qui me tendait ses ailes

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Encrés dans mon cahier, je les revoie encore
Les bateaux qui partaient, me laissant sur le port
Le vieux tutu froissé, que j´ai envoyé valser
Le lipstick rougissant de mes premiers baisers

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Avant qu´ils s´évaporent je veux qu´ils brûlent encore
Chaque jour chaque nuit comme l´essence de ma vie",Les Parfums d'Autrefois,1995
Pierre Drevet,"Les p´tites notes que l´on sème
Comme des cailloux des graines
C´est pour qu´on se souvienne
De nos joies de nos peines

Les paroles qui s´envolent
Comme des plumes des lucioles
C´est pour qu´on les retienne
Ces doux rêves qu´on cageole

Un p´tit air qui flotte dans l´univers
Un p´tit air qui rime avec les Airs

On n´sait pas d´où elles viennent
Ces ballades ces rengaines
Qui s´écoulent dans nos veines
Comme du sang de bohème

Un p´tit air qui flotte dans l´univers
Un p´tit air qui rime avec les Airs

Les p´tites notes que l´on sème
Comme des cailloux des graines
Sur les routes sur les scènes
C´est à vous qu´elles reviennent",Les Petites Notes,1995
Pierre Drevet,"A l'heure où la nuit s'éveille
Quand la lune change de quartier
Dans sa robe vermeille
Elle nous glisse des mots de passe à l'oreille

Ailleurs au fin fond du sommeil
On aperçoit des trésors démons et des merveilles
Il en faudra des efforts pour percer le mystère qui dort
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris

Plonger sans bruit et traverser des chemins interdits
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris
Se souvenir au petit matin blême
Des solutions données à nos problèmes

Ailleurs les dunes de sel
Et les plages de sucre roux brûlantes au soleil
Et les traces que je suis pas à pas
Pour sortir du tunnel

J'entends une douce voix qui m'appelle
Qui ne parle que de toi, et toi qui m'ensorcelle
Et qui revient chaque lune comme une dose d'amour nocturne
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris

Plonger sans bruit et traverser des chemins interdits
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris
Se souvenir au petit matin blême
Des solutions données à nos problèmes",Voler la Nuit,1995
