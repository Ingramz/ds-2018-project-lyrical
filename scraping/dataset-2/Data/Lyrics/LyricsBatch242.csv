Etta Jones,"You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
Cause you do something to me
That nobody else could do

You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You got the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
Cause you do something to me
That nobody else can do
That no one else in the world can do",You Do Something to Me,1977
Etta Jones,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me,1987
Etta Jones,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun (And West of the Moon),1987
Etta Jones,"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to 
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away",The Man That Got Away,1987
Etta Jones,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1987
Etta Jones,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man,1987
Etta Jones,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Bleongs to Somebody Else),1987
Etta Jones,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1987
Etta Jones,"I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy, he calls me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I'd say

I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it shall be
Crazy, he calls me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while

I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy, he calls me
Sure I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I",Crazy He Calls Me,1987
Etta Jones,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,1987
Etta Jones,"Don't mind the rain drops
Wait until the rain stops
You find the sun laughing at life

No road is lonely
If you'll only
Smile through your tears, laughing at life

Just live for tomorrow
And be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away

Start now and cheer up
The sky's gonna clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

Don't you mind the rain drops
Wait 'til the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life

Ain't no road is lonely
If you'll only
Smile through your tears, laughing at life

Live for tomorrow
Be happy today
Laugh your sorrows away

Start now and cheer up
The sky's gonna clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

",Laughing at Life,1987
Etta Jones,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you",Why Was I Born?,1987
Etta Jones,"All over town they're talking about me
The whole world knows you're happy without me
You've broken my heart, So what do I care?
I'm thru with love, no more will I need it
The word itself, I'll never repeat  it
A sign on my back I will wear, ""This is my last love affair""
 
I gave my heart to you, the one that I trusted
You brought it back to me all broken and busted
So I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again
You took my heart because you thought you could use it
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it
So I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again
Like a melodrama, in a simple manner
Love played the leading part
We had planned a happy ending 
But I'm left with a broken heart
I'll throw away my pride and say we'll be friends, dear
Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end, dear
I've sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again
 
I gave my heart to you, the one that I trusted
You brought it back to me all broken and busted
So I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again
You took my heart because you thought you could use it
Just like a little toy you battered and bruised it,
So I sold my heart to the junkman
And I'll never fall in love again
Like a melodrama, in a simple manner
Love played the leading part
We had planned a happy ending 
But I'm left with a broken heart
I'll throw away my pride and say we'll be friends, dear
Tear drops I cannot hide for this is the end, dear
I've sold my heart to the junkman
",I Sold My Heart to the Junkman,1987
Etta Jones,"If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken,
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken.

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you,
And pray my dream comes true.

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare,
I'm so a-fraid that
You may vanish in the air,

So darling,
If our romance would break up,
I hope I never wake up,
If you are but a dream.
",If You Are But a Dream,1989
Etta Jones,"I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

I'll have a Blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue, blu, blue Christmas",Blue Christmas,1990
Etta Jones,"I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams",I'll Be Home for Christmas,1990
Etta Jones,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way

Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

So, if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way",All the Way,1992
Etta Jones,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,1992
Etta Jones,"See that sun in the morning,
Peeking over the hill?
I'll bet you're sure it always has and sure it always will.
That's how I feel about someone,
How somebody feels about me.
We're sure we love each other
That's the way we'll always be.

Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money,
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along
Singing a song
Side by side.

Don't know what's comin' tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road
Sharing our load
Side by side.

Through all kinds of weather
What if the sky should fall?
Just as long as we're together,
It doesn't matter at all.
When they've all had their quarrels and parted

We'll be the same as we started
Just a-traveling along
Singing a song
Side by side.

We're all hunting for something
Something we don't know what
'Cause none of us are satisfied with things we know we've got.
We all forget about moonlight,
As soon as we've given our vow
But we'd all be so happy if we'd start and sing right now:

Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money,
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along
Singing a song
Side by side.

Don't know what's comin' tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road
Sharing our load
Side by side.",Side by Side,1992
Etta Jones,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Etta Jones,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1993
Etta Jones,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1994
Etta Jones,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

Etta Jones,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me
'Cause I don't want to walk without you
No, sire",I Don't Want to Walk Without You,1994
Etta Jones,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

That kiss will live in my heart

What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven

Etta Jones,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Etta Moten,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca

You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

A slowly ticking time bomb

I wish these lakes would dry and shift to shapes I recognize
Hold on, just wait
It's not that far away
Hold on, just wait
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow
I feel like I've been waiting
Month and miles seem to stretch
Justify an absence with a longing to be missed
Pictures speak a million words
But never answer in return
How is it I still feel you long after you've left?
Hold on, just wait
It's not that far away
Hold on, just wait
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow
Can you hear me now?

Eubie Blake,"There have been a thousand raggy-braggy prances 
That were danced at every ball. 
There have been a thousand raggy-braggy prancers 
That have pranced at every hall! 
But the bestest one that was, 
Is called the Baltimore Buzz! 

Now, first, you take your babe and then you hold her, 
Then, you lay your head upon her shoulder, 
Next, you walk just like your legs are breaking, 
Do a bangle like a jangle then you start to tip and a-tangle. 

[Chorus]
Then, you do a raggy-braggy motion, 
Just like any ship upon the ocean, 
Glide! And then you hesitate, 
Slide, oh, honey, ain't it great? 
You will simply go in a trance with the Baltimore Buzzin' dance!

Like reflections of my subconscious.
Beyond the starlit heaven the horizon burns
With flames, so red.
As my eyes bear witness to this euphoria,
This apocalypse,
I hear the gates within my head open silently.
A new world takes form and its attraction
Temps me to enter.
I leave my body without farewells,
Peacefully
Through violet corridors,
Painted with beautiful
Reflections, from my life.
A sunrise beckons beyond the clouds, so dark,
As rivers stream through the air in stillness.
Through the emptiness where
Thoughts take form,
And into the lands of purgatory.",Fallen,2004

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,
Eugene Chadbourne,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,
Eugene Chadbourne,"I was born in a lighthouse, my mother was the sea
I crawled to school each morning, when it occurred to me
That life's just a mood ring we're not allowed to see
And this is what it said to me

My room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane

Now listen all you swingers, don't you try to tag along
I know monkey see, but monkey's dead, for you it would be wrong
Put a dime in my jukebox, you'll only hear this song
And it won't be fun for long

Because my room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane

Thank you

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

To walk the caves of ice 
To break my fast on honey dew 
And drink the milk of Paradise"" 

I had heard the whispered tales
Of immortality
The deepest mystery
From an ancient book, I took a clue
I scaled the frozen mountain tops
Of eastern lands unknown
Time and man alone
Searching for the lost, Xanadu 

Xanadu,
To stand within The Pleasure Dome 
Decreed by Kubla Khan 
To taste anew the fruits of life 
The last immortal man 
To find the sacred river Alph 
To walk the caves of ice 
Oh, I will dine on honey dew 
And drink the milk of Paradise 

A thousand years have come and gone
But time has passed me by
Stars stopped in the sky
Frozen in an everlasting view
Waiting for the world to end
Weary of the night
Praying for the light
Prison of the lost, Xanadu 

Xanadu,
Held within The Pleasure Dome 
Decreed by Kubla Khan 
To taste my bitter triumph 
As a mad immortal man 
Nevermore shall I return 
Escape these caves of ice 
For I have dined on honey dew 
And drunk the milk of Paradise",Mel's Rock Pile [Live],2015

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,

One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day

They all gather â??round me, huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

I know I can't hide from a memory
Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Why, oh, why
Did she have to leave and go away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby, I'm lost

But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Why, oh, why
Did she have to leave and go away

I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know, hmm

I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

And I hope you're satisfied
You've got me where you want me
And you never even tried
A single look was all it took
And then, starry-eyed
I watched my poor heart
Go on that roller-coaster ride
I say I won't surrender
But I know darn well you will
My hopes are pretty slender
And my chances almost nil
Why should I try to alibi

We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar

She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

Das Schweigen ist nicht so gesund
Was für, „Na, und?“, wenn ich frag', „Wer bleibt unten?“
Du wirst es nicht glauben
Der Teufel macht Auge und schleppt dich in Kreis
Lässt dich zweifeln am Puzzle des Lebens
Die Ecken sind nicht mit dabei
So ist das mit Glauben, die Bösen erlauben sich alles
Wieso tragen wir den Ballast?
Ob das wirklich ein Zufall ist?
-Fall ist

Ich stärke meinen Glauben, indem ich die Zweifel eliminier'
Keine Zeit für Gedribbel mehr hier, Sonst scheitern Reife und Wille in mir
Darf mich nicht mehr berauben von Positivität
Endet doch ständig im Hass
Die Negativität, die mich ewig quält
Fehlt, wir bändigen das
Ich muss an mich glauben, jaja, ich muss an mich glauben
Mir selber vertrauen, jaja, mir selber vertrauen
Aufhören Scheiße zu bauen, jaja, Scheiße zu bauen

Er verliert seine Stimme, ich konnt' ihm vertrauen

Death for Jesus and plastic armies
Wouldn't bring me back again
Sweet as ether eyes I'm blind to them

Gone are your dandelions, falling like mine
Falling on land-mine pillows
Tired angels save my love for the lasting one

Sweet euphoria, mine is the heart you stole
Touched and broken are the things you love
Using stars to light your candles
Warms my face, but I can't remember yours
Gone are you dandelions, falling like mine
Falling like daydream mangoes
Diving swallows
Save my love for the lasting one",Sleep,1999
Euphoria,"There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me call on me

Fuck me without paying a rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's

Love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

And I want you

To take you away and leave you far behind
And love love love is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it and you still can't get enough of the stuff

It's savage and it's cruel and it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood and it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal, it distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up and you're left like a zombie

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

It's guilt edged, glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris

And I want you

Still recall the images that
Seem to live out there

Like skeletons of leaves on the wall
People changing places
I stand for a moment and it's gone

Still recall the images that

We didn't realise
Just what we'd done.

Hiding in the wreckage
Of broken dreams.
Standing by the railway line.

Just what we'd done.
Oh, we were too young.

Has been taken out of this place.

Taking me further,
Leaving you behind.

Eurythmics,"Why do you hurt yourself?
You do it very well
You do it so politely
That you couldn't even tell

When everything has changed
You think you're not to blame
How come you keep on talking
When the whole thing feels so strange?

But seeing
Is not the same as believing
When everything goes wrong
You're anything but strong

It's all bittersweet
Outside in the street
The grass is growing greener
Underneath your feet

We come and go
Deep water flows
Tiny leaves from small seeds
To tall trees do grow

But wanting
Is not the same thing as needing
There's no need to pretend
You can't turn back again

And loving
Is so different to keeping
The hurting that we send
Is so difficult to mend

Hold on to the good things
That keep you from falling down
Hold on to the good things
That keep you from falling down

How my heart aches
More than I can take
What are we really learning
When we make the same mistakes?

Where is your hope?
It's all gone up in smoke
You used to be so funny
Now it's just the same old joke

And laughing
Is so very close to crying
When there's nothing to defend
It gets you in the end

And living
Is so very close to dying
You struggle on and on
To find where you belong
Where do you belong?

You turn your cheek, pretend you're blind

I've got a life, though it refuses to shine
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine
All I'm asking for is tenderness, tenderness

Counting the seconds I don't sleep
I wish that I could turn back time

Eva,"Qui dove il mare luccica e tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto, tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e
La bianca scia di un’elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica, si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all’improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai

Potenza della lirica dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po’ di trucco e
Con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano, così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole, confondono I pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo, anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come la scia di un’elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai
Te voglio bene assaje ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint’e vene sai",Caruso,2016

Eva Avila,"Feels like I'm back in fifth grade
Day dreaming 'bout when you ask me to come and play
But you never do, you sit so far away
You don't even notice the heart I drew around your name,
I know it's crazy, I feel like a fool
'Cause every time you walk into the room, I always miss my cue

[Chorus]
I want to know if someone turns you on at night
I want to know if it could be me
I got to know how to make you see
That you've got me weak in the knees

Feels like I never learned to speak
Every time I think to ask how was your week-end
So I never do, I just hope to be seen
But I casually cross your path
While tripping over my feet
I know it's crazy, I ain't gonna lie
But every time that you give me a sign
I always miss my line

Oh you don't even know it
No...
There's a table for two
For me and you
Though it's so hard to show it
Oh...
When I give you no clue

Every day after day,
I been thinking of what I could say
To get through to you
Wish I could read your mind
So that I could find
If you're feelin' me too

I want to know if... oh baby
I want to know if... ooh oh
You got me
You got me",Weak in the Knees,2006

Honesty, is the hardest think,

Imma start to walk the other way

Eva Cassidy,"Some old hotel room in Memphis
I see the city through the rain
I'm just chasing me in my time
And remembering some pain

You see there once was a boy
And on the street he'd surely die
So the night bird took him in
And she taught him how to fly

See the night bird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame
For her memory now she's gone

To big bars and honky tonks
Any pleasure can be found
You can get just what you want
If you lay your money down

And lonely sailors do their drinking
My my my how the brave men do die
And the night bird sells her pleasures
Bringing tears to my eyes

See the night bird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame
For her memory now she's gone

So I guess I'll go out walking
Lord let the rain keep falling down
I guess I'll go and chase some memories
In the dark side of town

See the night bird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame

Bringing old memories
That I had locked away
The burden of anger
From a heart filled with pain
Was finally lifted
And I smiled at you again

And all hearts that break
Then all hearts that break
Are put back together again
'Cause love heals the wound it makes

I spoke such harsh words before our goodbye
Well I wanted to hurt you
For the tears you made you made me cry
All my hopes and dreams
Well they started vanishing
Those tender hurt feelings
Became a dangerous thing

Eva Cassidy,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

My mind's distracted and confused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
Kiss you when you start the day

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I",Kathy's Song,2000

Travellers are stopping by, check their oil and their p.s.i. 
Gas up and away to fly, moving down the line

And this gas-station mountain home 
Not a thing to call my own 
How I wish I was alone 
With a penny to my name 

Strangers say this mountain here is beautiful beyond compare 
But it's just a dumb old mountain; I see it every day 
If I could see sunset skies over fields of green or ocean-tides, 
City skyline in the night, I'll be dancing till the dawn

Turning in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback to moon nights, almost left behind
A suitcase of memories, time after sometime 

You picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you have said
And you say, ""go slow, I've fallen behind""
The second hand unwinds
 
If you're lost you can look and you will find me,
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting,
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting,
Time after time....time after time

After your picture fades and darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows, I'm wondering if you're ok
And you say, ""go slow, I've fallen behind""
The drum beats out of time

Gonna join in a rock 'n' roll band
Got to get back to the land
And get my soul free

Maybe it's the time of man

We are stardust
We're golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

We were half a million strong
And everywhere was the song
And the celebration
And I dreamed I saw

How strong the power of love can be 
Sometimes you just take my breath away 

You watch my love grow like a child 
Sometimes gentle and sometimes wild 
Sometimes you just take my breath away 

And it's too good to slip by 
Too good to lose 
Too good to be there 
Just to use 
I'm gonna stand on a mountain top 
And tell the news 
That you take my breath away 

Sometimes it amazes me 
How strong the power of love can be 
Sometimes you just take my breath away 

Your beauty is there in all I see 
And when I feel your eyes on me

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Mm everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa is on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Quando sopra il viso
C’è una ruga che non c’era

Fai l’indifferente
Fino a che ti accorgi
Che non sei servito a niente
E vorresti urlare
Soffocare il cielo
Sbattere la testa mille volte
Contro il muro
Respirare forte il suo cuscino 
Dire è tutta colpa
Del destino
Se non ti ho vicino

Che raccoglie i cocci

Pasaste con otra pa´ verme sufrir 
Y en ves de enojarme como tu haz creído 
Di vuelta a la cara y me puse a reír

Si lloro no creas que es por tu cariño que ya lo he perdido
No vale la pena derramar mas lagrimas por un amor 
Ya llore bastante cuando imaginaba que me olvidarías 
Antes si lloraba 
Pero ya no lloro por tu corazón
Pero si me acuerdo de aquellos momentos en los que me decías 
Que me amabas mucho con todo el cariño de tu corazón 
Pero no lo creas 
No he sido tan tonta que haz vencido mi alma 
Nunca te he querido para que negarlo
No quiero tu amor 

Hay la primera vez llore
La segunda ya no me dolió 
Y la tercera ya ni me acuerdo

No quiero negarlo que estuve celosa 
Al ver que con otra te burlas de mi 
Después de que fue mio el calor de tu boca 
Y yo que en los labios mil besos te di

Nunca había pensado llorar un cariño
Nunca había sabido lo que erea sufrir 
Pero te haz marchado sin darme ni un beso
Que pena dios mio me siento morir

Si lloro no creas que es por tu cariño que ya lo he perdido
No vale la pena derramar mas lagrimas por un amor 
Ya llore bastante cuando imaginaba que me olvidarías 
Antes si lloraba 
Pero ya no lloro por tu corazón
Pero si me acuerdo de aquellos momentos en los que me decías 
Que me amabas mucho con todo el cariño de tu corazón 
Pero no lo creas 
No he sido tan tonta que haz vencido mi alma 
Nunca te he querido para que negarlo
No quiero tu amor",Celosa,1996
Eva Jagun,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone To Watch Over Me,2011

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1992

Tal vez tenga que aprender
A vivir en este mundo tan absurdo sin tu piel
A nadar en este mar
Sin tu risa salvavidas
Si algún día no estuvieses
A mi lado al despertar
Tras si el sueño puedo irme
Que banderas levantar
¿Con quién voy a compartir
Mis victorias, mis heridas?
¿Y qué me importa lo que tenga que llover?
Si es contigo todo invierno sabe bien

¿Qué has hecho con mi vida?

Sombra y solo sumo la mitad
De tu forma de mirar

Que no haga falta hablar 
Hoy te a recuerdo y no estan fácil dormir

Me supe arrepentir 
Y aunque pedí perdón 
Hoy la venganza la Hace el karma por ti

Que la noche he querido jugar 
Qué, tu Cupido juró no fallar 
Está claro que al final 

Es tu culpa si bailando, tú me enamoras 
Que parezcan dos segundos y son dos horas

Cuántos astros se alinearon si yo te encontré 
Tú debes ser mi karma y lo sabes

Solo viniste para hacerme sufrir

Fue lastimarte y luego dejarte ir

Voy contando el tiempo desde que te vi
Ha pasado tanto que ya no sé qué decir
Si con una mirada ya te bastara
Sobran las palabras que ya no te dicen nada
Y es que yo son tán de ti
Soy tan por ti
Soy tan de estar esperándote 
Pensándote, imagino que a ti no te ocurre
Pero el tiempo que no estoy contigo aburre

No
No supe qué decir 
Cuando volviste a mí 
No
Aunque debiera huir
Quiero quedarme aquí 

Volvamos a empezar
Tratar de no pensar
No habrá juegos nunca más
Solo espera que al final
Seremos los de ayer
Confía una última vez

Mírame bien, tú que lo sabes de mí
El cielo abajo pa´ que sepas que di
Todo lo que tuve, para estar contigo
Para ser tu abrigo, dama del bandido 
Ya no quiero flores, ni que te enamores, 
Yo busco la cura, alejarte de mis dolores 
Tú eres lo que necesito, yo soy tu infinito
Llenemos el futuro de colores
Tú sabes decirme lo que quiero escuchar
Ya no me basta si quiero recordar 
Mírame a la cara ya que me conoces
En mi cabeza solo suenan voces que no me dejan pensar

No
No supe qué decir 
Cuando volviste a mí

Ya no mires atrás

Te prometo que si te vas, voy contigo
Que si el tiempo pasa yo seré tu amigo 
Que no me digan como vivó 
Mi manera es estar a tu lado de testigo 
Yo soy tan de ti, tú eres tán de mí 
Somos tan de estar tumbados aquí 
Somos tan de estar tirados aquí 
Que bendigo el día que te conocí 

Ah ah ah

No supe qué decir 
Cuando volviste a mí

Have a party in the mansion on the water with friends

Popping bottles in LA
She's dancing up on the table

She put my hands on her body

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Could last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Please don't let this be a simulation
(This better be real)
'Cause you a pretty thing
I hope it's not my imagination
(It better be real)

I'm dancing with you, girl
We spin it round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love

I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my moves
On Saturday, on Saturday
Tonight be for free
Now that I got you
I won't ever leave you alone, alone, alone
Call your on my phone
Baby let's party the night away
I'm dancing with you
I wanna party with you, girl

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like you the man
But deep in your hear you know she's a fan
'Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off 'cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spittin' at her
T-pain is winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys gettin' at her

What's the matter? Oh nothing
I reply straight buffin' , grabbed the bottle started chuckin'
She grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dance floor
We dance close, and then she pulled my hands low

Oh, I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss to the moonlight

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Avec le temps ça passera 
Tu es née pour briller 
Ici les flammes s'éteignent 
Les oiseaux tombent du nid car souvent la poisse nous brûle les ailes 
Avec ton sac et quelques sous comme une commette je t'ai vu partir 
Pars vis ta vis mais surtout n'oublies pas de revenir

Say I'm feeling scared
Boy you've got to let it go
I tell her what we've got is so right

Can it last out there
In this world you never know
Then I close my eyes and I wait
Imagining what she might say
Here comes your goodbye

And then she says
She believes in dreaming
And then she says
She talks to the stars
And then she says
She can see forever
From where we are

I see myself in her eyes
And my mind plays games
What if this all comes apart
Everyone around me turning

Promises to pain
History loves a broken heart
Then I see a smile on her face
And I wonder how long will it stay
True romance has died

Underground major
Wasn't he conspiring with Ralph Nader

We don't know why
We don't know why
Now he's painting passersby
In his corner of the sky
Was he a thinker
A heavy drinker
Was Nixon wrapped around his finger
I've heard crazy Alli swear he was
Was he a controller
A hip rock n' roller
Did he realize that the war was over
Or let them go on just because

While Lou's still walking on the wild side

Nights at the diner
Where a soup can serves as my reminder

Three weeks in a row
I spend more time getting dressed than
Where it is I go
There are people on the streets
Shaking out their hands
Some to say hello others
Stay as warm as they can
I'm stopping in
For a hot cup of coffee
With an old bum who says
He could've been James Dean
Now the chief of police
Has asked him to leave
I say no, no, no

And he wrecks my mind

Wow...someone knows my name
There's Dylan on the jukebox
A song from highway 61
James says he knows Dylan
That he wrote this one

But he prefers James
It reminds him of his youth
When he had a body just like yours

Has asked him to leave

I threw some things
I smashed some things

I'm not quite sure what
Drove me to the madness
Bringing on my dark side
Was it me
Was it you and your obnoxious friends

Bringing spring into the room
Somewhere on a country road
You're probably killing me
Under broken things
You found your wings

Was it easy to forget me

Than I'm glad you let me go

I don't mean to sound so vengeful
Or to hit you when your down
But you took my house of dreams
And burnt it to the ground

And now you say your're really sorry
Well that's really nice to hear
But where were you when
Everything we had got up and disappeared
And now its time to let go
Walk through that door way and let it close

There are two things that I need
Nothing and everything
Do you still have

Remember that night they turned your feet red

The sound of those shoes falling by my bed

If you could read my mind
You'd see it clear

Aren't parking space

In an ordinary chair
This ain't no dream land

And I smell like cigarettes
And I don't and won't even smoke the stuff

Reminding me why we're still friends 
There's a road we're on that never ends 
Cause there you are again 
I know that sometimes I don't think to call 
But don't start thinking I don't care at all 
I'm always on my way to somewhere else 
Searching high and low to find myself 
Stuck on that highway 
Between here and there 
I could be anywhere

And you've always understood my intentions are good
And we've been so close from the start
But the furthest distance I've ever known

I think someone stole the van
And the people here are like aliens
And I don't know what I am

And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Every time you opened your mouth it was my voice that I heard.
At least that's what I thought, or maybe I'm just lonely.
Believing every minute of every day, that you're the very only.

You led me on 'cause all your songs, were stuck onto my heart.
Why don't you finish what you start?

People wishing I'd come back.
I don't wanna' change like that.
People crying for old days.
I don't wanna' change that way.

Before, you had to sing your songs, there was nothing else you could do.
Well, I know all about it, 'cause I do it too.
I waited and waited and waited and waited for you to return again.
And when you finally resurfaced, it was like I'd lost my best friend.

You led me on 'cause all your songs, were really dear to me. Ohhh!
I wish your words were still clear to me.

People wishing I'd come back.
I don't wanna' change like that.
People crying for old days.
I don't wanna' change that way. No.

It's a fact and I can't fight it, it will always be unrequited.
If I had a bullet, I would bite it.
If you didn't mean it, why'd you write it? It will always be unrequited.
If I had a bullet, I would bite it.

You can't come back that many times, there's no such thing as a dull roar.
I promise I'll never make you wish it was like it was before.
