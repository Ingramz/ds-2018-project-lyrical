Radio Philharmonie Hannover,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1992

Radio Racer,"She’s not much of a poet but she’s got this way with words
That keeps dragging me back to my love for romance
Despite the way it hurts
Just when I think that I’m enough
There always seems to be someone better than me
She’s bittersweet

So tell me where we’re going
And why I’m lonely
Tell me the words that you told me on the drive home
I want to know, where do we go
When the light’s not changing
Like the boy who’s waiting
I need to feel with my old heart again
So I can tell if we’re better off friends

I didn’t mean it like that
I never could understand
The loss of the love
I was chasing away
But you like it like that
Love and you back to back
Suddenly I’m in need
Of a motive in me

But they say the boy is growing weaker each day
And it shows but I know
That without you I’m just blossoming
Into the boy who loved to sing
But you, you got me in a choke

I didn’t mean it like that
I never could understand
The loss of the love
I was chasing away
But you like it like that
Love and you back to back
Suddenly I’m in need
Of a motive in me

Don’t say that I’m not the type to love long
Don’t say that I’m a lie

You cut me off
But you’ve got nothing to show for I took the fall
But it wasn’t enough
You’ve got this bittersweet bitter-sweetness
Cut me off, tell me I’m the only one
With the love that you’ve needed to be
You’ve got this bittersweet bitter-sweetness",Bittersweet,2007
Radio Soulwax,"Names that sound familiar 
Secret hope for failure
Try and look into their eyes 
A part of the weekend never dies 
There's no tension in your dance 
As you try and hold my hand 

[Chorus]
It's not you it's the e-talking 
Closing in on the translation 
It's not you it's the e-talking 
I'm not sure which part I'm playing 

Looking like an in between 
Faces you have never seen 
Sirens scream, alarms go wild
Rock star paid me well to lie 
As you leave things look the same 
But I can't recall your name

Radio Stars,"Cowboys don't cry, heroes don't die
Good always wins, again and again
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true
If life were like the movies, I'd never be blue

[Chorus]
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
When hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
Darlin' it's sad but true
Cause the one thing I learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got tough
And tonight on the silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would",The Real Me,1978
Radio Stars,"You destroyed my confidence, you broke my nerve. I've gone to pieces, now this I don't deserve. Wish you could see what you're doing to me - you made me a nervous wreck. My hands are twitching and I can't settle down. My scalp is itching and my eyes roll around; I chew my nails right down to the quick - you made me a nervous wreck. Now I've endured for years and years your tricks and your games: my confidence is long gone. You said you'd changed but it's always the same - is this love? I don't think so
I've been around through thick and thin, now what can I say? my mental health is long gone. You said you'd change but it's always the same - is this love? I don't think so
I know  in future this won't happen again. I'll close my eyes and I'll just count to ten. And when I'm tempted then I know I'll resist cos you made me a nervous wreck",Nervous Wreck,1992
Radio String Quartet Vienna,"Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Each celebrating power that they wield
Their stubbornness and strength are revealed
And they combine to grow the crops in every field
And the partnership is sealed

And there isn't much about it either can do
When dreams that you chase after shower you
While the love that you allow comes shining through
Creates a path of every hue

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

Prepared is the way I see
Before me lies my destiny
It sprawls out to infinity
Should I choose to step upon

With colors inconceivable
It forces me to see him
For what hope has now become
...what hope has now become

Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

So I teeter, so I sway
Eternally almost falling off, I'm on my way
The path so fragile
And the path forgives
But only he who seeks it's color truly lives

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow

Do I become yet another

Fall in a cell here

We got the firefly, tiger eye apocalypse flow
So deep in the bottom of your bottomless soul
Send mind darts flyin' out, without a pistol

Redesign lost minds got outta the cold
Bring order to a world that is outta control

I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block

Well your plannin' on headin' down the highway
and this time you're going for good
well honey don't think twice 'bout the pain you leave behind
just do me one favor if you would
Don't say goodbye, just slam the door
Don't apologize, that only makes it hurt more
all your sympathy, will only make me cry
so get out, go on, get gone, and don't say goodbye
Now you were hoping you could break it to me gently
you were thinkin' we could part as friends
If I'd only try and remain civil
I'd see it your way in the end
Well pardon me if I beg to differ
'cause I'm the one who's gotta live with the pain
and when you're out on the town, I'll still be broke down
don't you bother with tryin' to explain

Words can't rebuild
All the trust my lies killed

You see I can't make I love you

Radney Foster,"There's a curve in the highway, just south of town
where a man has pulled over to figure life out
with only his concience and the lonesome sound
of diesels winding up grade
he's got a wife and two kids, and they love him so
he's got a woman down in georgia, and she's startin' to show
he's damned if he leaves her, and he's sure damned if he don't
and he wonders how life got this way
cuase it's a fine line in between right and wrong
yea he's been crossing over that border way too long
he should've seen it coming at him right from the start
now there aint' no escape from a broken heart
now the call of the highway is a powerful thing
like the pull of a lover, or a child in a swing
gave his heart to two women only one wears his ring
they're both gonna have his babies now
so how do you confess, what words don't explain
he never intended to cause this much pain
now he feels like a farmer who went praying for the rain
got more than he bargained from the clouds

he'll turn his car around tonight, go home and try to face the truth
everyone involved's getting hurt, now there aint nothing he can do

Radney Foster,"Better build your house on a rock
Or watch it crumble and fail
Better build your love, hammer and nail

I see it in the darkness as if it was broad daylight
I feel it down inside my soul when I hold you tight
It takes much more than passion for love to prevail
Gotta raise it up with hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
Lay that firm foundation down to the last detail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

You build one room for laughter, you build one room for tears
This ain't no game, no house of cards, it's gonna take us years
A vow that's only spoken comes to no avail
Put 'em in your hands, hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love
Faith and hope, flesh and blood
Lay it out so straight and true to the last detail
Gonna build our love with hammer and nails

Hammer and nail, we're gonna build this love

Or was it more like ten years ago
She nailed two dozen roses to the top of his coffin
And buried'em deep where they never would grow
Lord she buried'em deep where they never would grow

Now the Irish are funny, they'll cry when they have to
And the lady she moaned such a mournful sound
Me and the Mexican just finished the bottle
And remembered the days when Old Silver was around
Yeah remembered the days when Old Silver was around

'Cause Old Silver took the best of it with him
The lovers and the dealers and the dreamers of dreams
And Old Silver took the love of a lady
Who never got over Old Silver and me
Lord she never got over Old Silver and me

Old Silver had the magic and he carried the money
With the grace of a gambler and he lost it with ease
And he knew his lines better than any good carny barker
Wore the best damn boots that you ever have seen
He had the best snake-skin boots that you ever have seen

Now the lady she loved him and she never asked questions
Though she laid awake wonderin' on many a night
She swore she was leavin' most every mornin'
But she always would kiss him when he turned out the lights
She was always right there when he turned out the lights

CHORUS

Now there's always a sidekick in every B-western
Who's always in love with a lady who leaves
But she can't stand the memory so I really don't blame her
For taking the very first Greyhound she'd seen
But god I hate her for takin' the first Greyhound she'd seen

It wasn't school boys and ladies it was cow-towns and sin
And there was blood on the leather and tears in her eyes

Play my guitar 'til it draws blood

All because you wrote some song
I ain't no smarter than the rest of these clowns
I'm just making it up as I go along

I traded for a car 
The car is gone and the dreams are, too 
But I've still got your heart 

You always saw right through the smoke and mirrors 
Nothing fooled you for long 
You know the wizard's just a man behind the curtain shifting gears 
Still making it up as I go along.

I love the cards life's dealt me 
But I sure don't know how to play out my hand

There are nights I've tried to escape it

After she retired from teaching school
She'd pick my son up in her arms on Sundays
To teach him all about the golden rule
I heard those stories about Selma and Tuskeegee
How she helped Martin fill the jail
All I know is she had the strength of te grown men
Even though her hands were small and frail

Trying to hide the bruises on her face

She just held him in her arms like a little child,
An' she laid there an' listened to him talk for a long, long while.

An' the family torn in two.

While you watch love turn to rust.
And your soul is bleedin',

I finesse 'em on they back and aim an inch above the booty

Destroy the walls like a one man army

As you were having dinner with your families last night? 
Well, if you did then you must know that 
This world is now in a whole lot of trouble 

But I don't want you to get discouraged by that, no 
Because I believe that there's a solution to all of this 
Deep down within my soul 
All we have to do is put are heads and hearts together 

You gotta wake up everybody and no more sleeping in bed 
And no more backward thinking, it's time for thinking, ahead 
The world's changed so very much from what it used to be 
There's so much hatred, war and poverty, oh yeah 
us
Wake up all you teachers, you better teach a new way 
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say 

Because they are the ones 
Who's coming up and the world is in their hands 
When you teach the children 
You better teach them the very best you can 

The world won't get no better 
If you just let it be, no no 
The world won't get no better 
You gotta change again, you and me 

Wake up all you doctors, make the old people well 
Because they're the ones who suffer a lot and catch all the hell 
They don't hassle very long before their judgment day 
Won't you make them happy before they pass away? 

Wake up all you builders, it's time to build a new land 
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand 
Only thing we have to do is put it in our minds 
And surely things will work out, they do it every time 

The world won't get no better, oh no

Half-next I got your message I'm about to go page
Grand Central, time to blow some mentals, cashing the essentials
Build enough credentials, that's essentials
I make timbo's shine like the face on a dime
Make you freak, electric boogie, whap, Boogaloo-one
Jump back kiss myself and still keep myself in time
Check the brotha the you're seein' just stays on your mind
We got the fundamental usage 
To make you feel the looseness
You recognize the jungle and you're screaming ""Oh my goodness!""
The remedy to keep the party lively
It's no trouble or mystery who you call, yo
The JB's - like cool breeze on a coast
Ain't gotta say no more we let the vibe be your host
And let the rude boy roast, and like the fat rump roast
Won't you take a taste of this, you're on-off wagging your boast

Take you behind my bush, spill it on your belly
Keepin' on the down-low just like R. Kelly
Unload my clip with the JB classics
Tou know that baby damn like they drop their funky shit [No doubt!]
Like you, you got the flava, know you caught the vapours
Want that koochy lick in the only sky-pager
You know me from the native time, eighteen years young
But it was the trade that made your money give me some
Yeah, play on & play on & play on & play on Grand Central [Word up!]

Yo, yo, it's Mike G, the grand boogie, we make 'em bounce and such
I was just a young boy when I learned the jungle touch
Made a platina from rust, made a build-up in trust
And when the sound boy came, we came around and we crushed
We set the scoops up nice and that we through want to miss
And then we tapped them with the horns they never came off their crib
The rhyme reck'ning grows as the roof gets phrased
It's just another scene the Brothers had to put bun cleans
Orchestrated by the Brothers that groove in Grand Central
I learned to make you bounce as a part of fundamentals
Every record must be sold 'cause in this job there are no rentals
Let my soul die when only Vai-Chi's suck my mentals
When I rock upon the mic i'm pushing hard for my mental

From a choice, a second class one, you are the livin' proof of phase
And when your swollen heart, teased, fickle n' insane
Makes the call to me yo someone, you are the meanin' of my name

I keep a bitch getting stoned
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome
All my dips love giving dome
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones
Y'all either kids or my clones
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne
Them niggas talk ‘bout who they are, but they don’t do a thing
Can't tell me I ain't drunk I'm on that water in the club
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke
I'mma go get me an ""O"" and

Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow

Got a couple thousand dollars and some J's rolled up
I get money every day so everything's on us
I got my own strain, it come with my name
Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same
A different lane, we sipping champagne
I been in the game, just give me a flame
She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane
I'm balling insane, got more than six rings
In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J
A hunnid a day, come up with a play
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch
I just be up in the waist, stuff in the safe
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place
Fuck her for days
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know
I go to her page, she come to my place
It look like a maze, we roll up a plane
She look at my change, she start giving brain
If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same

You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the cheese got low
'Cause Toney, can't be out there pushing that blow
You made plans and dreams, not grands of schemes
I wanna search for the meaning of love, see what it means
'Cause we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall, for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soul mates, we melt like cookies and cream

The purple frying my brain, this woman's crying again
She, tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
That's what happens when you wife 'em and they try to tighten the chain
See, she in the right, so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe, I can feel her biting my chain
She, got her own, I ain't gotta buy her a thang
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the game
We, go together like, Martin and Gina, but
She get uptight when we fight like Ike and Tina, so
Love her or leave her alone, like I ain't need her tho
A minute later I'm back, like I ain't mean it, yo
We break up, just to make up, she fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A plus
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that

I'm into cashing in, getting this paper, buying up acres
Ride around, and yo, fuck with my neighbors
Pocket full of hundreds and weed, light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, riding through SoHo
You hear the little baby in the back? That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz'll make you a sweet night
And chill with the pawns we on, cuz life is a chessboard
You better have you sword and vest on
Never hate your enemies, cuz it effects judgment
They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese

I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources

I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
And got licked like papsy in a mob flick I got hit

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up

Politic til your deficit step, gimme your number
Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs
Catch my eyes like highs I want your bodily surprise
Double dime some time, Ice Cream you got me fallin' out
Like a cripple, I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the dutches, orgasm in my mindstate
Masterbate in your clutches, I want you for self
Like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen want to be callin' me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shoppin' spree you're lovin'
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets
I jizm like a giant break brooms out of their sockets

Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggaz what?
It's the after party and bitches want to fuck

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe

But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies

Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine

City niggaz who for blood money rockin Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket
In the streets while these people mark money in their Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jumps
Caught before a fake twenty dollar bill
Get em son, we ain't the one
Politickin, purse vickin, sick of these Dominicans

For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at
Caesar's Palace eatin salads
We beatin mics and the keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell

From staircase to stage, minimun wage

Hit a store owner named Mike Lavonia
Italiano, slanted-eyed bangin' them fat Milano
Selling coke right out the bottle
Sometime, a nigga brought nines to test with minds
Crazy peace, buying keys in Greece
Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dope figures
Condo with his chick, rockin' the gold vigor
Mafia flicks, tyin up tricks was his main hobby
Teachin his seed, Wu-Tang karate
Mixin drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rollin' with spics
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Took sixteen shots in his fist to bank
And his pet piranha, he named him marijuana
Smokin' ganja, callin' his weed paisandra
Claimin New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like her-on
I can't front though, truck loads of indo
Soon to blow slow, his ass is out now, tally-hoe

My raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and, styles blazin, Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
Rhymin, my nigga Lou Diamond will wrap it up
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Havin them poodles on the lockdown buyin me
Amarett-ahs, and chewables, stackin pharmecuetical

The gold's untold, fuck it it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller
Of the whole globe, god damn I got it sewn
And yo, whattup pop, pop the suitcase high
And we can talk, you can walk out the fuckin building
And get caught, save the fully inflatable

A hundred dollar Rottweiler goes to spot sellers
Guns and glocks go to niggaz who got props
On top, jail niggaz get mad bigger
And yo, mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to momma, this rap wonderama team got drama
Comma, plus smoke realize marijuana
Chef may resign to boat across the Farasana
Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate
They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens
I told you, money stated with the night beams, and two rings

Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath
Here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast
The full blast

Then skate to the next state
Further upstate, I heard they got crazy weight
Bagged up by the gates, in crates like disco breaks
Yo look out for Jakes, give it all it takes
Let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo Blake, niggaz don't fink, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape
It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes
Drug related, paper talkin bout the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the Big see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth

The rap scar is on rap chrome
Put it on seal it on, we're silicone
Spark it on your Talkathon
This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bar clones, war tones, raw tones
Blowin out the door, bones but
Your rap's fraudulent, float in these rap quarter inches
Reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got NIGGAZ here to play with you
You know the steez you know my whole program
Brothers from the No-Lands, all we want is the G's
Guns and grams, livin fat like the Hoffa
Mafia, sippin eatin pastas
Layin in the house tellin the seeds about the sagas
Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly
Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly
I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees
Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, takin no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse",Knuckleheadz,1995

Yo man, you gotta understand, this shit is real though man

Yo peace Rae, peace God!

Whassup baby? God damn, look at you man
Damn God, I got a shit out you man
Man, I done watched you man, since you was a little crumbsnatcher
A little weed-hopper running around here man
Look at you baby, you look good
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations
But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby
A good listener's a good learner
(G-O-D's my reality)
I see you listened VERY well, understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is coming baby
See sometime, it could be like, a rear view

Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would
trick me out my money shootin dice, niggaz is you crazy?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
(G-O-D's my reality)
Crazy you crazy man
Yo Rae, you remember that shit man?
When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?
(I'm elevating strong I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
And you'd catch it, from Old Man Freed
He'd be yelling ""You little slick ass""
Ha ha ha ha
Talk to me baby, knowhatI'msayin?
Ha ha ha ha
I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin you growin
But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you
The child you was is making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from baby
You DAMN sure know that you don't know where you going
Can you see what I'm saying?
Know which way you travelling
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
Cause I've watched you baby
You my main man
Yeah
(We're elevating strong and we're going on to the highest degree)

Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's duckin
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catchin, rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy
Day one, in my spot July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin up Devines hittin them with nines
I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife
It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though, then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin to war, you know we headed to the floor
He woulda, did it, for me fuck it, let's mosie
Schemin dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin in my mic ""Yo we gotta go""
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session?
He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yellin ""Them niggaz sellin two for fives!""
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feedin my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters

Yeah, Rae baby
Feedin my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to ressurrect the dead)
I'll say it one time, and be ceratin that fake God does not exist
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale
of devine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
of solid knowledge
No man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness
See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad",North Star (Jewels) [*],1995
Raekwon,"It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough

This nigga had mega ice on Chips Ahoy!
Cats surrounded, this political brown kid
All out the wind yo, my man walked in
Pulling mints out son had mad clientele
Order me Cristal twice Kion, chill!
Watch them niggas, a-yo that clique's from outta state
They bubble weight in Far Rockaway with Blake Carrington
You know the kid with the most dough getters
And terrors on fat shit clique they rock Lo sweaters
That's my man, that's my man too
Call him up on the strength of the Wu
And watch me gain duke
Grab the cell, I got a heist to pull off well
At the end of the week, I'm buying you a L
Lexus nigga, I ain't talking bout Hancock
No time for weed plus no time to get locked
That night, up in the staircase
Cousin had me laced out, skeed all outta my face
We gon' get dat crunchy chump for all of his lump
Don't try to front, you was sweating this Hilfidiger
Guess who walked in having it, his man from Farragut
Confront him with the Ruger on his back, walk in black
Where's your man, where's the sky blue Land at?
Stop playing Wu in the back, smacked him wit the gat
(Yo, money said he be here in fifteen!)
He's not lying, wait for the Millenia green to pull up
He got the Donna Karan shit on, two rings
Six carats a piece plus the chain swings
Like anchors on ships flooded with all diamond chips
Back pockets: two clips - four-fifths wit rubber grips
Laying, two bottles of brass I was slaying
Meditating, red dot be waiting for my payment
Heard the key in the lock, cocked the Glock
Turn the lights out, dip behind the couch
Kion, gag his mouth
Infra-red at his head when he entered
Butter soft Perry Ellis leather with Dorinda
A friend of, Kion's wife, Kenya, the bitch larger than life
Yo, shorty be fucking mad Columbian niggas
Fuck it, get on the floor meet the black Lex Luthor
Strip fast, the bitch had on Claiborne drawers

Raekwon,"Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, the things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual

Perhaps bullets bust niggas discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building niggas building, like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack sales bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GS's, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew feel 'em like swords

With the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop
In the 'nile, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up duke I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was wiling
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got juxed!""
Sharpened toothbrushes, 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block",Verbal Intercourse,1995
Raekwon,"No man all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know
I keep em broke
Wake up one morning with some money they're subject to go crazy you know?
I keep em lookin good, pretty and all that
You know, but no dough
When I get a bitch, I got a bitch (right on)

Word up, that motherfuckin brother wise
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Teachin the uncivilized
Yeah, runnin the streets, know it's deep
Word up, check his technique, yeah
I be Ghostface
Flippin the, marvelous track
Yeah
You know the steelo, but yo, yo
Check the bangin sounds that I invent
Fake niggaz who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga
Wit his back against the wall
Heads clapped once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin on Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit a switch
And yo, I had to step to her in a manner
and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em
Especially, when you're browsin, goin fishin
Your wasteline, bangin like a bassline
Physical form is well complexed
And yo, I love your outline, Boo
Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong
You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust
And yo, your stee is high potent, yo
We can go the distance, I put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted
I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it
Word up, yo, straight up and down yo
Check the joint, baby
It be the Wu-Tang production
Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit
And brothas catchin repercussions
Yo, straight up",Wisdom Body,1995
Raekwon,"Who come to get you
None, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotties
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that whole pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mugabe, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
Thirty-six chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin Isle
Bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze

This goes for niggas who know
Wu will blow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool Papa, see you with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up their workers if they have to
Señoritas, fucking up a storm buying Gods margaritas
Sucking his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally wear Figaro chain yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah

Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

God stepping forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

Who come to get you
None, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells more like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies",Wu-Gambinos,1995
Raekwon,"You're a crossbreed, I'm a knowledge seed
I want action, that's what I need
I never put doubt in my mind
'Cause I know when I touch the mic there's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up, out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be large
Tired of sittin' on my fuckin' ass
Niggas I know, be runnin' around with mad fuckin' cash
Who the fuck wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid, to be a fuckin emcee?
I came out my momma pussy I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old still on welfare
So I gotta get paid fully
Whether it's truthfully or untruthfully
With my boston bloodthirsty process

Move 'em in move 'em in
Move 'em out move 'em out
Stick it up raw hide

Yea, gotta come back to attack
Killin' niggas who said they got stacks, 'cause I don't give a fuck
I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin' your fuckin' face, some blood
I'm goin' out my fuckin' mind
Every time I get around devils
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin'
'Cause I'm comin', I'm dope like fuckin' heroin
Wu-tang bloodkin', a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin 'shot up with ol dirty insulin
You bound to catch aids or somethin'
Not sayin' I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it
What

Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like thai stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame, while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now eat my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-tang, is bangin' like a ron g tape
Rza pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it john gotti
Collidin' on the track, like gin and watty
Check the calender, I warn any challenger
To step up feel the blast from the silencer

Move 'em in move 'em in
Move 'em out move 'em out
Stick it up raw hide

Comin' soon to a theatre near you it be the wu
Yeah find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?

[Cappa] Where your sparkle at kid?
Rzarector

[Break: Raekwon the Chef]
Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

[Verse One: U-God]
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld tote mm-hmm

[Break: (first two lines)]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killah]
A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

[Break]

[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

[Break]

[Verse Four: Cappadonna]
You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA Rob name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound, and now we out like bears

I got to take him off of here

That sucker think he good, that sucker think he can whoop me
And I know he can't whoop me, I
Hey boy, the nigga whole style is chump

Let me get mines first
Then after I get mines, you can do what you want to do

Yeah, scandalous
Yeah miraculous, the arsonists

Yo, kicked down the door on the spot, 260
2L, I heard they had O's for sale
I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep it low, faded licenses plates and great plate
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was using him
Power sun, jungle, physical, you know the God
He go with Tim, the one who called Lover of God
Y. E.quality S.elf, I know the natural law now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the Iow I heard he got BORN original sin
Back in a drive-through Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him Dunn, aliens is snatching our bread
U.F.O.'s moving in with bigger plans than Fed, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that stuff
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Keana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a green Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Rashean to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She said be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface God forbid
She say, peace to W, who's watching the kids?

Two hours later, scheaming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Keana ain't telling no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
And Tymeek bought her a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nidow
When we get back, throw you a bit out
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Marriott
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We going upstairs, I hope one nigga is empty
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, Dunn yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fucking a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, ""Do your thing Chef, handle it""
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing, much disguising
Surprise we coming and their eyes were tranquilized
And bugging, throwing her twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block, you lounging
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop fronting
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll start stunting
Bitch, show that bit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling

Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand
Oh shit! Yo, yo where that shit at yo?
Yo Chef, where that shit? What? What? Hey yo)",260,1996
Raekwon,"It's assassination day, I stalk

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line
I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter
From the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark
Pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered
My unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible
Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God
Indivisible
With liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retreat through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God
His shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra
UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops know
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

Aww Shit say Stark-aligist, Starks-aligist
Fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn
And celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside loud and got on

And we came to rock, the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Bees

Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge
Knowledgists, street astrologists
Light up the mic God, knowledge this
Fly joints that carried your points
Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, he pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Rapel on fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union
It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style
On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials
Especially that, aluminum bat in the act
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex
Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem
Abusing em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbin niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Body chemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My Benz spills, what up Lils
Murder one Dunn
Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it
And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang
Sweep it out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is handcocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us",Daytona 500,1996
Raekwon,"These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects
Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin

We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties

Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like eskimo flow
Cappa villain stay chillin' take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine

Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jewelin', tri-color Cubans
Swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper
Fake gators from Jamaica, wizards be passing like Lakers
And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace
Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey",Fish,1996

Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks
Showin off his 850 plus, what a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin' forties hussled in a rain
Old Earth, shootin' dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, ""I Miss You"" written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original, neighborhood, criminals
Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildest niggas peeling caps known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clapping
Slept in his principal spreads, threads, made of satin
Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he should of kept it real and went for kill
Cause if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will
But, shit will never calm down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off
Money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relax like he lived in there
Two kids was beaming him, them niggas from the movie theater
One had all Guess on, looking like he had a vest on
The other felly pell tucked with a firearm
Moving slow, baseball hats, crazy down low
Word life God, this bull kag nigga gotta go
Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5, G headed King Tudpea
About the size of Little Maurice
We got to get up baby, no cousin, count to ten
I'm running in my first instance, is to return em the time is now
Warfare and pull delf
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out
Don't move don't even flinch
Fix em up, drop the head, don't want to get blood in the tux
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbing him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Randy came out wacked out with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tud head and the cash
Then he shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee fast

Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another

I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover

Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side

Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go
Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow
Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those
Glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes
Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what?

The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing

Raekwon,"My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a number two pencil
Stabbin students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in ""Dead Presidents"", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin' that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood ""los sangres"", blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison

My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try ""Now you know you done fucked up right?""
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all

J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
""Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed!""

Aye yo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around
And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that fagots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'

My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up

[Chorus]

It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Aiyyo la, what's up son
Aiyyo, you read the papers
2 columbian niggaz hit these funny niggaz
A heavy routine, chevy, yukon green
Had crazy coke up in that piece by all means

[la the darkman]
The kids was mad flonting, rae', it had to go down
Killers be coming for your neck, when you wearing a crown
4-5's and ak's, kids ready to spray
The cats got nine lives from around my way
Timb boots and dough galore, two techs by the door
So, when the po-po come, I can take them to war

[raekwon]
Same subject, techs and royalty checks
Plus marketing the drugs, equal mad respect
I gotta get mine, blast mad nines on a regular
Fake competitor or player, I mean this maker

[la the darkman]
Who's the rap mayor, it's me, I be the slayer
The dark's in the realm, you contemplate your prayers
Meteorite or clips hitting in the 9-5th
All you yapping mc's, like pancakes you get flipped
I got a thirty shot clip at the grip of the hip
I'm a mad av. warrior, young tale from the crypt, kid

[chorus: raekwon, (la the darkman)]
As the world goes round yo the same is the same
(same junkies on the corners shooting shit in their vein)
What's the deal, black man must rise up to the top
(representing darkman with this real hip hop)

[interlude: raekwon, (la the darkman)]
And you don't stop (and you don't stop)
Yeah! (and you can't stop) and you can't stop
(word up! word drop that style)

[la the darkman]
You only live once, execute your dreams
A third real triple beam, weighed out my scheme
For the cream, my sold cracks, never could relax
Now build with wu-tang, spitting lyrical facts
Young black mad bastard from the concrete street
And never leave the land without strapping my heat
Keep peace and don't beef, word life tariff
I stole the million dollar show 'cause I'm that dark thief
La, dark gold spark, ready to rip you apart
I was born with a gold shield over my heart
So, don't start none, it won't be none
I'm dominating the screen, my reign just begun
I got raw and uncut for the kids doing the biz
You can't figure my physical like a pyramid
I'm that wicked dark star, may la now ride
I switch to warp space 5 like the starship enterprise

Deadly Melody part two 
That's my word 
It ain't safe no more, no more bitch 

Yo yo 
Brain is punctured and drained through the nasal 
Hour of assassination be upon you 
Moving with the tiger strike  bound  gagged and shot 
The head in  (not sure of this verse) 
East remains hot with police 
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic 
Extended clip rewind, bust mine, 
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions 
Observe the magnetic attraction 

And its time for some grid 

Iron rap, action-packed grudge match 
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno 
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard 
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O 
Plus like a calico, tally ho 
Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo, 
Stole-a-might, crash your wind pipe, with the (right to right?) 
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights 

Sight beyond sight, late night, city light 
Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like 
Splergin, dirty to the grain, no detergant 
Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty 
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin 
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence 
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, its curtains 

It ain't nothing like hip-hop music 
You like it cause you choose it 
Most D.J.'s won't refuse it 
A lot of sucka M.C.'s misuse it 
Don't think that Wu can't lose it 
Too much to gain you'll abuse it 
The name of the game is rapture 
This one is completely captured bass 
 
Yo 
I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts 
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlov, 9 Glocks 
Technique your rhyme part machine gun ammo 
Sporadic flow buckle the foe, intro to outro 
Galico, throw verse, we slide my dough first 
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk 
From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow 
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno 
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees 
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds 
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze 
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede 
From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast 
Equipped to perform the task 
S-I-N-why, and what, had a gut 
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust 

We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous 
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets 
Extravagant, drop a helicopter high 
Up into the sky, lines philosophy 
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus 
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous 
Criminal minded killas rust 
I intend to build a fortifying man, 
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick 

Aiyyo fluid rap bend, through a black Veluga black act 
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap 
Slang A-K, national, geographical, mathematical 
Slide up in your worth casual 
Night air dog, who wear it all, blouse down to bra 
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable 
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers 
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers 
Sly-workin, network beserk, mad hurting 
Killing whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomindales 
John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo 
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through my beige window 

Spazz Spazzola Ola 
S-I-N-Y 10304 
Lock your door 
Crack your jaws 
Drop your draws

Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit 7up
Had a black wiz spoke German
Higher learning burning 
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot wid a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her, 
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass layin' like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renassaince 
Queen Elizabeth aunt
Crazy swift Cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dying kid
Showing off her diamond 
Flashbacks now it's me and him again
Last word I caught 
'Put your money in we could have the shit bumpin'
That's federalo music
I caught the glimpse from the bitch 
When she winched yeah Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow
It's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it 
Broke the money down
What's the total count it,
No count it over in the mix
Day going slower,
Nope not time to motor
He estimated over me not being a crook
Count it over
Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him wid the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wildin'
His bitch is in shock
Start smiling and speaking on Valen

Hell and song called the dogs to get on him
When we caught him the only famous nigga

Was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail
I used to play baseball wid him
'Til he got large son bought a whale

Blood got a salty taste 

I can tell furniture fell out his place
Laced now it's a case
Threw up vomit on my Kobe
Snatched all his ice now

Chrome teeth boating of a loan key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail

Chill you bigga than the ocean
Slow motion play it off no emotion
But my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him

We might kill you circulate death

And who bit off the last nigga tape stole his state
Wake up we running outta plans
The devil inside of him 
Tricknology is in one hand
Future's so far to see
The present's how will it be
The past don't even ask just believe
Looking in the dictionary 
Trying to spell out hard words
Define 'em and design 'em 
I shine and curve
Take this jewel in and conquer me
I blend it in wit ganja
Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor
From the seventeen million God raised 
Two million lost slaved
Nineteen million may we all praise
So when we wake up
Let's straighten up and get it together

Came through bangin nuthin but Wu
The crowd blitzed'em
Much love

Carryin the champaigne glasses
Crazy asses
Niggas on his neck like ski masks
Chill step on me
Axe slash through a little fifty
And crash
I want to drink knew shed pocket the cash
Buck Samonite hype nigga
Iron Man blowin the mic
You motherfucken right
Live highlight then I seen him
Nigga was raw, stepped in
Bitches flexin' next to him
Bad Mexicans
What up showin' you love
You got a real style
Where you from
The Ow
That's Staten Isle love no doubt
Oh God he had a take bout a hundred
Some strange nigga thought he had arranged
God gone blunted
Pay attention its cinch like sacks and macks
He did the knowledge
Ran to the bar and grabbed stacks
Now the whole parties bubblin'
Niggas got love his bug
He had on one glove
Rollin' up drugs
Him and his Vikings ran through
Stopped played the back
Then they walked through
Live from New York
When niggas hug you

Gettin money and laced up

Gettin' reefer to blaze up

Yo yo
Madonna money in our pocket
Boating in a rocket
Bout to blast off
We charged like a socket
Whips be cleaner than a fuck
Jewels basically struck
Strait up Brolox style
Layin in the cut
Bottles strictly done
Ring the alarm
Rollie on the arm
Arms crossed two sneakers on
Fly shit
Nikes the majority
NYC state of mind
And we talk with authority
Five borrows is sterile
Still out of town playin mellow
I thought I seen Shalon swade yelow
Rippin' it
New six flippin' it
Shorty is drip dippin' in it
When she sit through dick in it
Came to conclusions
What's the solution when your losin'
Respect mine
Now from the foul line
Streets is a part of us
Teaching the seeds through the heart of us
Some get locked that's a scar on us

Come here you oven head
Yo what's the word
Dred upstairs
Passing all packs escorted from Kinetta ear
Yo the nigga's name unknown
Kingston, had it sown
Never rocked the combs
His wig was big
Rob robs on the side , little lucky charm
Dred with jars , flooded graveyard
Brown clarks on
Playin feds in the shark bar (la la you ? ? star)
With another dred named Gov
Both diamond jimmed out
Rockin rentals, spittin phlegm out
Sucked his teeth, two fingers pointin down
What up bonna, passing marijuana to Tanya
CEO of Benny-Hanna, he fucked, sent her to Ghana
He's Benz nigga, rocked shorts, beige Tims nigga he real
Took us to Switzerland, dressed us all ill
Smoking ganja, rocked Anacondas, on next border Elantra
Sent it to his mama
Now that's a major move, the nigga love family
wouldn't hand me no drugs, showed me his jammi
Bulldog Stanley
Flexin on kinal, sit down, do it Chinese style
On graduation day he threw me a towel
He came through, heavy like fuck, suit flammable
Ill pair of gators he copped in Beirut
Had his man wit him, just stare , don't stand wit him
If assassination strike, he gotta make plans wit him
Roll a joint, keep him on point 'Don Troing poing coin'
Freaked it, members like that I want to join
The next day I heard he got knocked , fucked me all up
We felt it on the block, let the seeds rock
Peep what the nigga got rocked for
Smuggling dust in Rushmore, four more he went to war for
Moral of the storo, conspiracy smacked mortals

You know?
How long is your cream? this long?

Eh yo, his belt got karats in it
Swift description, e-320 nigga pitchin'
Rock a raw dinosaur chain, hang to his thing
It's like, he pump isolated, still cashin' in cream
Niggas in the hood hate him, drew a vase of him
Blaze 'em, he actin like shallah raisin him
This is hydrogen, son ain't live as him
He like maguyver, chin 4 spies with him
Roll relentless, desert that he hold is a gift wish
Shash the list, give his miss dick

2 cannons that'll spray, rockin' banana suede
Suck this drunk alcohol dick
Fuck y'all niggas with hits
We bout to shit on y'all shit

Y'all brothas want to call us out?
Name names, otherwise it'd be the best to shut the fuck up
Get pimp-smacked up, jacked up and macked up
You're scared and froze of bein' exposed
I own Harlem, I bone harlem, call me the mayor
It's my borough, you don't want no problems
I'm on now, you dead pop, all jokes aside
I ride the top, you glide the bottom

Shit y'all, leave flat line to stick your's
We flip off basic and brace it
8 kills, 47 ways to taste it
Never understand what you never been told
You did your book bitin' off of my scrolls
We hit man, Colombo, coats and hats to match
Bust off quick, and then, guns go back

I move like Arthur ash against god
Four raquets, eight balls and no practice
Every cypher's a heated discussion
The industry was like a beat that needed percussion
I brun the music, shit that make crews flip
State that I'm the illest, this is qu shit
I used to heat-hole, now I'm takin' over like the repo'
Bitches that roll, cee-lo that'll sniff a kilo'
We went from frank's and greens to shanks and beans
Now we drive our navigators to banks in queen's
Y'all can't fuck around, your words ain't right
Every time I touch the mic, they say ""perb ain't right""
But that's the truth though, d'oh, infact that's it
When they drop this shit, I'm gon' cop that shit
The new star, you want me? I'm at the juice bar
Y'all once hap' niggas, give me two stars

I heard what y'all rappin' about, but bring your stash out
You shouldn't throw rocks if you livin' in glass house
Sneak your weak shit at us, on the low though
Where these cats come from, speakin' about po'
He got cash to cop and I'm crashin' 
But half of y'all cats just catchin' up to rae' last year
Got guns in the jungle, call 'em Jurassic
The chrome, the steel, the 20-shot plastic
While y'all niggas cop jars, me and my niggas cop bars
Gettin' head from rock stars
We blowin' everything apart, I'm smashin' the charts
How I see it? (yo, how you see it?)

[chorus]

Eh yo, what you want to be when you grow up?
Yo, I want to be a leader
Slow your speed up and stop tryin' to be us
Say somethin' always, got a future? stay out the hallways
And get yourself right, a one hundred more ways

Fly like iceberg, nice with verbs, precise words
Bentley swerve, hit the curb, jump out, cock back, spit out
Shut your block down, get out, criminal route
Gangsta shit, can't talk now, gun in your mouth
Cream team killas, cocoon cats like caterpillars
Giant size gorillas, break niggas backs from the skrilla
Scratch, greenback track, fed's berserk
That's my word, disrespect recca, get what you deserve
Inferno, melt down mic's, millionaire in my afterlife
Broke bread with Christ on the last night

See me in the tunnel and you trouble me
Get my dick hard dancin', sippin' my bubbly

Bagged my man Chaz 32 bags he copped flight

Jakes want us, 
Playin' Einstein lenses and Auroras
Little meek caught us 
Couple of francs, peep the blue Taurus
What up tuck your chain they came for us
Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes
It was who I thought it was
2 pair of Clarks one pair of Lugz
Wit the hardbottom nigga with the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there 
Doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit 
Spoken loud words all we want is his head 
He did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now
Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit

Handle it wise and brutally yo

I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg 
Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg 
Razor glass full, salute all teflon, shoot wit the left arm 
We sleepin wit nukes, the blood is shed warm 
High-voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums 
Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers 
Yo, remind what the team chanted 
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted 

Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war 
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own' 
Blaze wit a bent four, yo these laws is your's 
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws 
So decievin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin 
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin 
Operation, apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus 
Straight up status for maggots

Keep ya eyes bright comin out ya buildin, duke 
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death 
Niggaz slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma 
I keep guns 'cause it's like that, you figure it out 
I got an arson for niggaz tryin to figure me out 
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin ya mouth 
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down 

Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it 
Cut me a cheque 'cause I don't talk business 
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions 
Take trips with my niggaz to the Keys on the weekends 
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits

Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms want to hit me

[Intro: Chip Banks of American Cream Team]
What? Aiyyo, y'all wanna do a track wit us or some shit?
We the billion dollar boys club.
What you got a hundred thousand for us? The fuck's that?
Three rings and a hair cut or some shit?
Aiyyo, American Cream Team, baby.
Heavy hitters, New York City Giants.
Gamble for plots and 4 better for spots and things of that nature.
Pop off.

[Superb of American Cream Team]
I don't rock wit hoes, I puff Optimos
Your label ship gold, but only copper sold
Perb got flows, everybody and God knows
Fuck a bitch for two dimes, she got to cop those
Used to be a thug, now he wear cop clothes
Try to come to the hood and we shot hoes

[Chip Banks of American Cream Team]
I don't care who you got a deal wit or who you chill wit
Banky'll run up in your session and shut you down on some real shit
Till the Chef be like (Chill, kid)
That's word to Abola Perrione, dem not know who they deal wit
Chef Banks, uh-huh, slash Banky
Got the whole world callin Flex tryin to transtate me
Said New Jack City 2, Banky B. Nino, push a 2000 benz-ino

[Killa Sin of Killarmy]
These rap icons, mass spit fire out of cons
Fuck a bigon, rely on ion in my python
We squeeze off, long disc when we piss
Resort this, gun powder coverin wrist is blastphemist
Shotties say, ""Fuck!"", cursin my name
Knowin damn well, I'm hurtin the same
What part of the game you playin?
Kid, I'm sayin, yo, three months ago you was on
You fallin short now, chasin a don, you're money ain't loned
Faggot fuck, bag him, stick him in the back of my truck
Strip him and smack him up for actin up
Be slitherin, hit him in the rips again
Broke the code of honor that we livin in
Depleted the whole click, is never when
But never that

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Aiyyo, there it go again, same shit, just rep
Show me ya holdin kid, control ya rep when we rollin
Worldwide, niggaz look live, collection cream by a land slide
Settin up to son, won the grand prize
Stand up, why? Where it came from? Accord and the 5
Where the name from? Read the Rob, yo
Yo, while we handglide, slang lye
Chill, ya better recognize, 'cause it's cut out for big shit, Giant Size

[Polite of American Cream Team]
Yo, we from the ghetto, the land where everythin is real
Nights was tough, days came hard as steel
Still we played the field like players witout contracts
Broke the trends and the fans far beyond that
Comin to America, now we tradin places (uh-huh)
New faces in the hood, and they racist (uh-huh)
>From all the squeezin, they callin the precinct
We could battle in ya PJ's or battle in the becon!

[Raekwon]
I kick vocals at the top of my lungs, drunk
Playin cards, young start wildin on dunns with guns
Remmy doctor, old man jams with voice of Hoffa
Chill, slap shorty up at the opera (Battle in the becon!)
Uncle got the Kangaroo, rock the Kangaroo, boo
Start cursin out white boys shoes, you wild
Thirstin Howl wit a growl start barkin at crowds
He actin like he got shark skin now

[Kingpin of American Cream Team]
I lace my hookers with G-String, Liz Clairborne
Don the King, hustlin, nigga Don I mean
Exquisite, a radiant, brilliant chemist
American Cream Team, billion buck spenders
Strip boutiques, advantage, get move on
We too strong, the menace, nothin to lose con
Yachts we cruise on, money that's too long
Pull out a check book, coupon, purchase the Yukon

[Chorus]

[Outro: Raekwon]
It's never been a game, stop playin, stop playin (repeat to fade)



",Giant Size,1999
Raekwon,"Uh, expensive things, diamond rings and things
You know, rap life, rap life, say what, ah, uh

Rap niggas, we different individuals
Some of us be frontin', some of us is really criminals
Swimmin' in the women and money we never had, it's sad
Rap could turn a good nigga bad
But not Catash though, I gaffle respect with no hassle
I'm still the same nigga, light skinded, curly afro
What's up though? I'm still the same nigga, a superfreak
I blow a g a week, catch me burnin' rubber up the street
Rap niggas always smokin' indo
So everytime we puff it's twenty dollars out the window
But what is friends fo'?  We gonna blow that dough regardless
My niggas live the life, and they ain't even rap artists
Rap money, we get that shit and blow it
We trick thirty g's and ain't got shit to show for it
Let me get that case of Moet, let me get that CLK
Let me get that ounce of bomb from my man from East L.A.
Let me get that

Rap niggas get money, press up and get hundreds
Be like all them niggas on it
Which side rock the most, it don't matter 'cause it get notes
Meet you on the left side of the boat
Coast, drivin' it most, we like where them niggas go
We like everywhere, party where the fans go
It's all rap hype, young black niggas, that's mad hype
Got ya station in a smash right

My Likwit niggas made a killin'
We dropped three albums and got the whole world dancin' on the ceilin'
So I'm feelin' like the villain that cracked that safe's combo
My nigga had some hoss I told him shoot 'em through my condo
He shot 'em through, they peeped my scenic view
They started askin' questions, but fuck the interview
What y'all really want to do? They said, ""pop the Cris'""
I said, ""You like rap?  Well wrap ya mouth around this!""
Rap niggas, young niggas ballin'
We on the motorcyles doin' ninety down Mullholland
With the gold chain swingin', fallin' to this greed
This rap life got us buyin' shit we don't need
We don't need the jet skis, but let's buy 'em just to try 'em
We splashin' out the Lex and got all the ladies eyein'
Us now, and we don't fuck around with no wife
'Cause all my niggaz is livin' the rap life

Rap niggas get money, press up and get hundreds
Be like all them niggas on it
Which side rock the most, it don't matter 'cause it get notes
Meet you on the left side of the boat
Coast, drivin' it most, we like where them niggas go
We like everywhere, party where the fans go
It's all rap hype, young black niggas, that's mad hype
Got ya station in a smash right

First of all, before we move on
Shit is like a Yukon, son
Slide shit on like Grey Poupon
Mergin' in the suburbs
Gettin' raw with greenery herb
Real ill niggas smack birds
Fat words showin' proof how my gat work, go shoot, kill
Smack a blackbird, jettin' in an AC-herse
Big Jim stay grinnin' in a six, spinnin' it, kid
Nigga who flex, Lex threw ten in him
Stand posin', blowin' shit, coastal from east and west
We rockin' our vest, cannon might roast you
High powered hydrolic Eddie Bauer rockwilder
Who wilder?  Slang bit niggas on the collar
Amp might blow
I might land, set up shop, and glow
Shinin' like a lamp post, my camp post
Cream leather green leaves forever
Goin' to do whatever
Corns and crab niggas, they roll together
What up tash?  Black hash, we invented the spaz
High like sixteen niggas over ten bags
Real niggas gon' ride
Fake niggas gon' slide
Check the next issue, faggot, in the vidibe

Rap drama, the drama never calms
I be on the celly phone, trippin' off my baby moms
Tryna make her understand I get paid to rhyme
I don't show up at your job, so don't show up at min
'Cause there's no biz like show biz if y'all niggas ask me
Show money, that's like pimpin' 'cause we get it tax free
Catch a check for thirty-three, cut straight from SRC
Take it straight to any counter, cash my shit with no I.D.
Rap women, they always be around us
'Cause we from out of town, and they be lovin' out-of-towners
Wash up in motherfuckas like a TV evangelist
'Cause they from where they from, and we straight from Los Angeles
Rap money

Yo, what up

What's up, nigga?

What's goin' on?

Ay, what's up Rae? Man let's go half on a football team, nigga

Yo, I was thinkin' about buyin' two basketball teams
What's up? What we gonna do?

Ay

Matter fact, we can do that
Lets do that

Rap niggas get money, press up and get hundreds

[Raekwon]
Yo, it started out in East NewYork
Where I grew up, learned how to walk
Favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers

Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar
Starvin' for mine, bust three at ya
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy

Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
Yup, that's ya Pops

Still, that's me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal 
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out

Three days away from home he come back stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big

Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
To God I pleaded

What should I do? knock your self off, but the God succeeded
And the most scariest part is you better have heart
'Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Have Faith in your God

Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black Clarion, ready to die for the family hard

Alcoholic vultures with toasters
Sheep skins on
Leather sleek Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit

Smoke a bag of wet and set it
The block we deaded
Society's grown too black and too strong to prolong
Got my Woman with a gun in her thong

It's kinda wild how we livin'
The Devil's force has risen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders

That's real, 'cause we need them and they need us, that's love for ya
Leavin' on this moment
Meditatin' at Four in the Mornin'
Nigga you screamin'.....
 
[Chorus]
I got hustlin' on my mind otherwise I'm feelin' fine, I'm ghetto
I like black tint on my car, at the park a Superstar, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

[Madd Rapper]
Born in the gutter
A Black Pops and a Puerto Rican Mother
I kept a stolen whip and razor sharp box cutter
Known from Albany Ave to 98th and Sutter

My leathers was pleathers while ya'lls was butter
Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it

Didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my Dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx

Knowin' all along the shit was wrong 
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last, 
It keeps goin' on, so keep movin' on
Same old story, my Pops left

Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex
With around the way bitches, 
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps

I stay Brooklyn zoned, underground is how I network
Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts
So pardon my appearance, everythings all good
Nigga I'm just like you except I'm from the hood. 

[Chorus]

I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto

This goes out to all my peoples in the hood, in ghettos all
Around the nation and all around the World, know what I'm sayin'?

Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy",Right Back at You,1999

Bustin' guns rockin' jew-els that shine like sun

And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
Will have my enemies, behind trees

I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
I live by name and cut veins 
Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
When I dine, the automatic weapon 
Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite

Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray

While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift

Twas the night before twistmas
And all through the house
We had guns and money around
Layin' on the couch
Was dressed with black jewelry this time
Mmmmmm, c'mon

[Sticky Fingaz]
Everybody want me, I created thieves
Why I'm almost as important as the air you breathe
I been through hard times, when it wasn't enough for me
Stick a weak kid'll have you livin' in luxury
I'm the reason niggas sellin' drugs to fiends
I'm the reason Mr. Simpson got off clean
I'm the reason some parents gotta bury they kids
And I'm the reason why your cousin on the run from feds
I've been through customs, borders
I've been handled by authorities
Drove people crazy when they couldn't see more of me
I've been saved, I've been buried alive
Say my name enough and any nigga testify
Who you think lead that whole seller ass that time
All by myself, I created black on black crime
I'm America's most, I'm tadded up with Ghostt
Even my hand got big, from net to gross
I'm emotionless, yet I breathe jealousy and envy
People kill for me or die to defend me
But in the end am I really worth the sun
Rich people make me work for them
And poor people work for me
Who am I? Nigga I'm money
Who am I? Nigga I'm money

When niggas was ready to murder me
You stayed up in the crib, like a bitch
Lookin' ill, and it's lurkin' me (for who?)
I got stabbed for you
Yo, shot up the ass for you
Should stop blowin' the cabs for you (for who?)
Chill, some niggas called crabs for you
Holdin' them garbage bags for you
Ill, blowin them hags for you

I'm more powerful than God, or Razale
Cause when you pray to God nigga, you pray for me
I'm an exchange hand to hand, with heavy weapontry
This one couple fucked on me, and slept on me
Up in the dice games niggas stepped on me
Bet on me, couldn't pay, bled on me
I enslaved populations, and controlled masses
I come in all forms, coins, paper, plastic
Even credit, I owe you
You work for me nigga, I own you
If you are smart, you make me work for you
All ya life you try and get me and it's hurtin' you

Would you blow me in a month and have nothin' to show
Or would you invest in me and watch me grow
Take me to the streets and flip me from, do' to sto' to do'
I underseen things I wish I hadn't seen
I came between loved ones and families
A nigga kill his old man to get his hands on me
Got secret ensciptions, examine me
want to find me, the bank machine is where I be
And showed 'em to a hundred grand, F.D.I.C.

Shit ain't a game, we don't run game, we run businesses
Watch us shine and watch the World be our witnesses

Verse 1: (Raekwon)
Observe real though
Half cieling of blow 
Rhymin' Deniro dough
Dundalero yo
Let the steel blow
Hear me yo, wild trump style
Dons connect three hundred ones wow
Floatin' like a maccarel, that's foul
Most craziest, laziest 
All eye seein', blaze this majorness
Mechanic record on a beige disc
Pain, whatever level bankrolls
Frequent plain clothes
Lex spit six, arrange those
Snot nose pros
Dark skin hoes
Crazy ill fly jersey Expos
Neck froze
Fuck your set, slash vetos
Still Lex knows
Gasoline jumper on with the most fly livest Gortex made in Mexico 
Bricks Fifteen Five
Celine Dion ties
Two Thousand dollar bubble eyes
Yo, the theme cries
Rollin' for cream yo now watch the laser beam rise
Sling pies
Doin' our thing high. 

Verse 2: (Baby Thad)
The chain of command is effective immediately, the cause and effect
It calls for your death
Black suburbans at night with no lights ram you off Hollywood Hills
Tearin' off the doors to your Lex
Steel Magnolia
Fear is takin' over ya
If you ain't bowlin' we rollin' straight over ya
If you ain't real about it don't talk
Hollow clips evict you, set supper for the Hawks
Send a missile at your ear like (whizz whizz) ""what was it?""
Buzz the buzzers
Blow past with clutch buckets
They'd rather not see you in Malibu eatin' veal
Strength recognize strength, real recognize real. 
Chorus 2x

Verse 3: (Chip Banks)
It ain't a game dick
You know us, European whips
Chain frost bit
Peter pay Paul now pay the boss kid
Heavens the stakes are now even
Sent the heat rash to your camp, left his shirt there now you barely
Breathin'
Slow leakin'
Look at your people weepin' 
I ain't have to quickdraw Mcgraw you I could Fifty Two block you
Switch my stance up Southpaw, drop you
You got small digits, your riches is midgets to mine
You sip Ballantine, I'm crown Royale
Sit back laughin' while ya'll plans foyale
Ya'll funny style, you'll never make it to trial
It ain't a game kid.

World premier, metal gear 
Fanfare, stand clear
All jokes aside, this is our year
Still here for real ya'll, bare witness

NewYork City's sickness
Simple street principle
Cream team invincible
Money interchangeable
Bulletproof Benzes
Ralph Lauren lenses
Soldiers in the trenches

Exotic chains with red gems

I burst like a sea crackin' through the earth,
Flower blossomin' 
For your rhyme sickness spittin' anti-toxin
Best merk
Get your neck jerked
Dynamic mic teck squirt 
Lyrics splurt blast the expert 
To his head 'till his legs hurt
Knees become wobbly
King got love-love, born equal equality
Bring bodily harm, probably bust a brain artery
Kidnap the track
I could rap to the high hats
My widescreen imax lyric spread until the climax
Wu instrumental breaks scratch past the aftertake
Live performance concert, make shorty wop masturbate
In the tub legs open water be rushin' from the faucet
Thinkin' about the Wu-Tang gang bang she almost lost it
I move from the blood marked turf
Where the heart hurts
And merk to the heavily refined hills where the God lurks
Everyday I'm countin'
Son, my thoughts can move a mountain
So much joy in his eyes he'll make you cry a fountain
You purse snatch while I earth snatch and take the earth back
Have you runnin' like Devils bein' chased by the church",It's Not a Game,2000

(Two) Hold between me and you, these the rules, see'mon
(Three) Yo, we gotta stand together to take cream'n
(Four) Without me and you the crew just could never be

Imaginative mental, blood flyin'
The most hardest niggas cock they iron
Foul, live like a Lion
Listen to the streets and your gun go off
Sorta like a show off
Jungle way of livin', hittin' dro off
Lifestyle changes niggas see that 
They gettin' anxious just to throw one in your ski hat
Watch your language, yeah, you fresher than a Million bucks
You got a new hustle, you hardly knew niggas would envy lust
They gettin' hungrier and niggas bust
They lit a bigger dutch
Fixin' them Calicos to dig your guts
Detectives roam
Niggas come home and got a bigger dome
Ready to zone on what a nigga own
Caught in the mischief
How can you live when it's a sickness 
That sorrounds that projects and the trenches
Walkin' through the bushes at night
You gotta be sharp like a butcher knife
Subtly show up when the jooks is right
And everything will have a major like 
Whether it's black or white
Nobody knows until they snatch your life
Wake up son, the season's just a thing the mind make up 
It's only real kid, ha, wake up!

[Chorus x 2]

The meat market pardon me, the heat market
Chill, we got it on lock, the nigga got to sweet talkin'
I gotta eat and got the beast targeted
Relax, my Brothers on 'role, niggas got police barkin' 
They want us killed, seize the sargent
Blowin' each cartridge
We ill, realer in each market
Feel the leather jacket, sleek ostrich
Unleash the arsonist, just popped the wig off of each hostage
Make it real and make his niece watch it
Yokin' Grandmothers up, we kill until his peeps squash it
Verse is somethin' mean regardless
A green jar of harvest
Just smoke, niggas got the green Garcia's
A terrifying team of heartless
Move on the Narcs's
We only on it for extreme profits
And anyway we dream darkness
I saw it through the Jean Paul Gotier mint green gleam optics
So wake up Son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up.

[Chorus x 2]

A message from Elijah's kids
My eyes opened, got wise on the biz
Start risin' my wig 
Seen everything I saw before
Had dreams behind a wall
All I wanted was to balance my all 
Make it through feedin' my kind
Readin' the lines
On how the dollar bill is shaped and designed
Taught from the Eighties
Talk, build, and protect all Babies
Strong shelters with strong Ladies
A nigga died, died amongst Daisies
He did it for the Babies 
That's peace, feed 'em if they gettin' lazy.

Raekwon,"This Nigga just bought eleven machine guns
And he brought them in my crib

Glittered out, stout face, teck, Rae up in the Hilton
Heard Nia Long is in the building
Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service
It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous
Lift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid
What I do, duck!
Rae up in the shower singing
Son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like Santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap

Yo, what the fuck happened?

It was a set up to get wet up

Starks your bleeding

Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain
Yo hurry up, we got to get him up
Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch

Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices

(Ghostface Killah)
The hit came quick
Hit the jack, star six
Ghost

Put down the phone stupid
Wipe off your prints

Rae ran hysterically
Slipped on soap
Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope
We got three minutes, nobody seen shit
Somebody might have heard shit
Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit
Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed
A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds
Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me,
What you want sweaty, Lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut
Praying how me make it out the telly and touch

Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
Caught up in the grimy shit
Finding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit
It was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
A Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer

Hey yo, the pressures on, sonny got murk
Its time to move fast
Hey yo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash
Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates
Blew on the first class flight to L.A.
It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn
So were it came from?
That nigga we stuck and took the caine from
We should have killed him when we had him
Yo I was holding a Magnum
Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon
His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago
She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoes
We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on
By then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah
Sent the kite through the Pens
Him and big Dan
Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots
Halls is quiet
CO's with babies on their arms look tight
And this nigga from down state got shipped up north
Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off
Then heard that shit, plus got that kite
Money got murdered in his bunk that night",The Hilton,2001

But you'll never understand, no
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)

[Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up
Children (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up
Got back off the road, heard you sleeping with fam
The whole hood ran up on me, I was like ""Damn!""
So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently
Arguments, face up in the air like you hating me
Ask you one question, was it good?
He have you on the wall like me, was it hood?
You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbing the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot
I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out
That night I cried with the kids, I was out
And my man, I'ma do him in
And the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him
And you can keep the crib, all I'm saying is,
let me find out you got men around my kids

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
It was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage
'Member those days had you smelling my boxes
Old Gold up in the hood and Big Dup
We could push through the grimiest streets, then throw it up
Like ""That's my nigga!""
Anybody got something bad to say, son'll come through and deliver
Brushing off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him
I bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him
Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats
Heard ya water broke I was like ""Phewww"" and ran back
I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix
To find out that bird nigga tapping my shit
It's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough
Bigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow
This thing here, ever man in the world goes through
But fuck that, I put a lot of money up, I'm hating!

Found out it was dizzin' ya world
Had us living in a fantasy world
I wish we never broke up girl

[Raekwon]
Hey yo you killed me with that
""Who bought this?"" I bought that
Knowing damn well in reality you bought jack
You ain't lift one finger, but you claiming what's yours
Running all through the house, bugged out, slamming doors
We used to dress like twins, sweats, baby blue Timbs
You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in
You think that I'm the biggest bird in America?
Catch me on TV, I'm come back, never the

Ten years later, still in the gid-game, the Clan, we was one the greatest
We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who ya'll tryin' to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin
Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me
I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me
The Wu become us, the world enbraced us
A new day, a new life for the God
Got a hood thing, watchin ""Ice Water"" evolve
Destined to build a mountain - niggaz is doubtin my work

Growin' up, we've been through hard times
Life on the streets, just tryin' survive
Plus my niggas got mouth's to feed
We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines
Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you
All that bullshit we've been through, time to draw the line right here
Got to stop now, time is the issue

It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves

One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars

And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas

How you leave the dope game to pursue rappin'?
Already knowin' that ya shit was trash

All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap
And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that

And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?

That you be gettin' more company then them, they just be scared of that

The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
'cause she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees
You forget that, something to talk about
Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see

I ain't ashamed, I know that it's right

I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray

Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please""

They said we fell off, the streets don't believe you faggots!

Take seventy more shots, the remedy, Wu through the fence
This bench God, lays in gents
Eh yo pop the head off right under the tents
This is more current events, pay attenti

Y'all mothafuckas got about fifteen seconds to live

Yo, it's a new year, bitch, and I'm takin' over
My whole crew here, bitch and the game is over
My niggas told me face this soldier
If rap don't work, get back to that bakin' soda

On the strip tryin' to catch more cake than Oprah
I got clips that'll leave you with ya face on a poster
I talk slick and I'm sprayin' the toaster
Sparkin' shoot outs and start poppin' off shit the way I'm supposed to

You the type to go up North straight scrappin' a sore butt
And ain't nuttin' worse than gettin' shot as soon as you woke up
You got work? I'll be rapin' ya dolja
I'm takin' his pack and breakin' his back and makin' him throw up
'cause the draft's like a bomb and I'm waitin' to blow up
I'll take cash on ya mom's and turn her frame to donuts

Yo, yo, yo
Eh yo, I'm blazin' hot, never haze or flop
Wanna battle? Name ya price, I'ma raise the pot
Put ya car on the line, I'ma take ya drop
Put ya jewels up, I'ma take ya chain and watch

It's like I hard ball and you, you play soft
Just call me the Hitler when I spit about eight off
Shots'll rip ya face off, nigga ya heard me?
Beat you black and blue like a Hitman jersey

P.C. never been known to play games
I spray things that'll re-arrange ya brain
I cock and aim, miss you, pop ya dame
Only reason that I came through's to lock the game

Yo, it's time to die, who you gon' run to?
Who you gon' call when them dogs come confront you?
You stand firm or be the bitch that you is?
Would you grab the guns or run into the pigs, you mothafucka, huh?

Would you grab the guns or run get yo' wiz, you mothafucka, huh?

y'all niggas see me eatin' all of ya plate
Don't give a fuck about ya background, shit about the songs you make
And I know you see the draw on the waist
Lookin' stupid with a vest on, these bullets might draw on ya face

They call me Alexander Sean the Great
'cause ya bitch said she love the way the dick talk all in the cake
I need this bank money, throw me the safe
All these killas involved, the cops'll fuck around and chalk the place

Yo, they wonder why we hang with crooks
Shit is take free, I see not used to money off the books
Broke faggot nigga caught in a jukes
I'm a pirate in this rap shit, I leave you niggas off the hook

What the fuck you gon' do when we run in ya crib?
Either we leavin' with the bricks or we gon' leave with yo' kids
And we only got hours to live
So give up the ransom or find they ass up under the bridge

'Lite never been afraid, so keep lookin' niggas
'cause I'll rob yo' ass faster than some Brooklyn niggas
Yo this rap game twisted, everybody beefin'
Everybody killas now and ain't nobody leakin'

Smoke a lot of weed so I don't like to fight
But I might go upside ya fuckin' head with a pipe
Got a bulldog, not only do he bark he bite
Give a fuck about a hood, it ain't safe at night
You fucker

Take it back 1993, '94 or something
Yeah, runnin' through the stairs and shit
Trynna to get to the roof
Narcotos is on, some other shit

[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
My niggas won't stop til we straight, select bigger gates
We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo
Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from
Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing

[Raekwon]
Corner filled chains and Gucci glasses
The was the era when we flipped all the shh, on the store, splashed it
Had Dominicans runnin' and eatin' steak and cheese sandwiches
They in the back, braggin', the fifth slut
Fuckin' with a few niggas nieces, take it back when we would
Rock for a leases and stand on the speakers
I got the shit locked, I'll battle you, you, you and your whole gridlocked
Little shit, supported the beef
Fly Pierre couldn't tell me nothin' with a brand new beard
Couldn't wait, but kept survivin' the years
We sold crack daily, crack mad bailey's, crack faces and skulls
Sit back, watchin' the mack, twist carefully
It was them horrifyin' times, spit dimes
Police sneak up, I hope he know the time, get mine
Just livin' the ghettos, where we suppose stand loyal
But the game'll get you trapped when it's time, yo

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
The year's 1990, everybody grimey
Crack was what's in it, the vehicles was 1-90's
Young shorties be gettin' their bread, haunted by Jamaicans
Them niggas had their corners on red
Map the laws, runnin' cards, playin' bars
Mask the coke in the cars, twist the gan', mad, crackin' cigars
Smokin' through Queens, bitches stealin' Guess jeans
Get the scope on our stars, little did we know, we folow they dreams
Now we get around in live limosines, flash stacks in cuisines
Combat, get to smackin' the fiends, just max for a minute and lean
All the shit for the moment, slick omens, my opponents would scheme
We were shot downtown, hit trains, buy cables and remain
The illest villains, walkin' in spots
Playin' the corners, baby, vision or not
Said yo, and when it's on, we gon' rep and rock, nobody call the cops

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
Where all the major swingers, yo
Where all the live fresh, came home, up state livin' fly rangers
We rep them niggas and we love 'em
Sons, we hug 'em, they make it home and be gone in a week
That's some letters, all my niggas live together
Baby yellin' whatever, we all write in hands, nothin' but creeps
Hold me down, love, I'll hold you fatter
Watch me catch both of these actors, it's Ice Water throwin' hits in the cling
Bloodhounds is on you, goons is beamin'
Take it to the team to team, plot thing, blew you a bean
It's just a young poor hustlers thing
But your gun got a ring, if you gonna live like a young kid

Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection

I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money 'cause it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?

And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I'm only here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me
PC creep with at least three heats
And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats

You niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft
You seen ya man, tell him I'ma kill his ass
And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash
I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past

'cause it's the, ice water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you

Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja

Y'all touch my property somebody gon' die, uh huh
This ain't no joke, it's for real, my niggas they totin' they steel
All it takes is a phone call and they ready to ride

Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the hell, the gates is open
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?

Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple

Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries

Keep it genetic, or dead it, ice water inc we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach

Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em dead in the club
And let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?

Eh yo we wyld in da club, style in the club

Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug

Egyptian look, gazelles on, L's lit, this how it's goin' down
Ski mask, channel shit, move like a terrorist click
Nineteen eighties babies, worldwide, ya girl on our dick

All you know is Rae look good, he hood, envision the flips
I make money like them niggas who take money
Fresh out the can, Duran look, astro van
The ill Castro, rap son of Sam

More rugers, more bow and arrows still no losers
Forty five dollars ahead, I go at niggas shootin' lyrical leads
Stop absorbin', break shit knock that gay shit out ya head

Wyld in da club, style in the club

Let's put an ending to chitter, nigga, see me in gloves
I'm the proof in the booth, bitch, read me in blood
It's Face at you, freezin' muthafuckas like a statue
I got a loaded Kay Slay pointed at you
The end of your beginning, before you even get it started
You fucked up, now you in the presence of a heartless
Nigga, from out the gutter, spit it and don't stutter
I'm a gangsta, raise around the dope fiends and hustlers
But silence is golden, and the streets don't talk
Don't let sheets slide, 'cause beef don't walk
We attack hoes, fuck a nigga with wack flows
I'm the last of a dying, bitch, act like you don't know
I'm the reason you niggas walk around thug
Just remember I'm the one made, you can get touched
So what you gonna put a record out, you a muthafuckin' sellout
Slay told me to knock your ass out

[Chorus 2X: Scarface]

Now you got a leaky' T-shirt from the kay spit

Snow white five glendin', the elevator with the crib
Blend with it kid, I feel one of them Bill Clinton's
Mills is spent, still don, still rentin'
Still yacht flyin', still killin' fish, still killin' clicks
The fifth out, don't even breathe out
And ganna with the ill thieves, slick hammers, we all fam
What, pull out the four, pop the truck, see the luxury morgue
The casket leather, the python seeks your dog
Flashback, he and them Benz's lenses
Actin' like he did ten sentences, son ain't real
He got excited, parked the truck, just leaned the lighter
Twist the blunt, sat back, son beepin', we drove off
It's money on it, until them young niggas don on it
Devour the snitches, you get on, you born with it
Make a toast for hours, for all the money and power
The right division, don't never let corns get it, drama

[Chorus 2X]

[Fat Joe]
Pass the rock, you niggas gassed a lot
I never liked ya ass, but then again, you can't be shocked
Most feared in this rap game, and ain't for frontin'
Best believe when shit pop off, I'm blazin' somethin'
It's the J to the Izzo, you know the rest
Nigga can't get a Twiz-o, but flow the best
I've been doin' this for years, ruinin' careers
Niggas never wanna listen til the toolies in the air
It's the kid that don't be givin' a fuck, I hold a shit outta grudge
The type of nigga that'll spit at the judge
Niggas gettin' gelled, they say I'm livin' it up
'cause I'm at Hollywood with Denzel, flickin' it up
I play the corner when the shit is hot, summer time in the X
Kay Slay got the shit on lock
That's where you go to find the God body
Second to none, unless you compare him to John Gotti, God...

And we the Gods, still tear the whole hood apart
Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggaz hearts
I'm intellectual, plus professional
And Walbaums to vegetables
Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear
Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggaz
Blew shotties in niggaz lobbies, the grand RZA
We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke
Allah Math', show me when the needle broke
Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up
Never knew what they had, now they proud of us
Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission
Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me
Rae, we gotta generate, lord, I feel the Ditech, the mildew
Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little
Wrap up the whole rap government

Blocks is hot, feel the shot from fourth/fifth it
With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar
It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that
Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter?
The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'?
Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin'
Your street team, bunch of weaklings
Don't ever let me catch your reachin'
Respect when a grown man is speakin'
Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on ""creepin""
The five percent of ya'll, keep on teachin'

Okay, now, same shit, different day, grindin', gettin' paid

Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight
Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play
Ya'll gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house
Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers
Roll that izza, pour me another kizza
Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up
Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes
Let the herb spots run til the cops come, suppose
I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday
Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club
See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it
We comes undisputed, with batteries included
Honey's ""bee"" like Meth, I be like what?
They want some free cd's, I'm like ""see these"" nuts

You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves
At four twenty, when niggaz knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged

In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull
I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full
Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to
Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu
Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu
Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi

All this time I felt like dyin

So I (gotta move on)
Yes I (gotta stay strong)
And I (gotta keep it going)
So long (so long)

It's usually the beauty that attract me
But perhaps she was the right person,
Her personality made me happy and that's why I pursued her
I'm a dude that make manoeuvres
If I choose her then she whipped cause my dick as long as a ruler,
She maybe kind of crazy its cool long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Poobah and I can charm a computer,
For us to conversate all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing when I'm speaking she taking lessons,
But every time we argue and fight I feel like I'm dying,
I feel like trying tell you the truth,
You feel like I'm lyin but I'm a move on cause I'm strong as ever
Without you, I can do better but I can never forget about you girl.

[Chorus]

Ay yo I laced you with the girl braces when you was young,
Doing ya thang I went to amfye and buy you dem benaces,
Queen of the temple with the sent of a Lemon
All of that lenin shit at time I'm just observing your menin with all that long hair,
Sexy, mean walk and your von gear we at the pond you all up
Under my arm when we shopping embracing your re-lock and gloks and tims
Flyin from Africa yo back to the, you just a sadosure that's why your ones is owsed
Up cause when I needed you, you never got flossed up a laced out lady with taste
I gotta just kiss ya face keep ya nigga growned these are the brakes. One!

[Chorus]

Without her being close is depressing,
They say ain't nobody perfect but a honey rosted complexion
Close to perfection plus she got a body that could
Probably turn a gay man straight, to stay in shape mommy started taking karate,
So while she get it done in the gym runnin the treadmill I'm runnin for feds
Still, keep one in the bed still I be reminiscing boo,
Missin you that's dead real cause you nice in the bed
And you nice with the hand skills you awfully fine,
I can't get you off my mind, I ain't frontin yea I lost a dime
But you crossed the line and ain't follow directions you gone, gettin back together is out
Of the question, I moved on.

Crazy ammo get blown wherever I sit, son
That is my throne
(You know how we do it)

Aiyo, pop, pop, pop, pop, when it shots, whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
'Cause he's so far from freeing the world that seem strange

I come from a place where they say death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block dance to a different tune
Every night and every day hotels of foul play
Turns fatal when this hostile land of AK's

On any date not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder, it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew but he was moving at a snail's pace

Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position

The mission was to move in with sheer brute force
And lives they get lost on a collision course
The streets are fascinating so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors

Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth but can't hide the evidence

A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45 but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime

Aiyo, pop, pop, pop, pop, when it shots, whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked now his whole life is changed

Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked now his whole life is changed
'Cause he's so far from freeing the world that seem strange

The story had a familiar ring of truth
But it needed a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere the bomb was gift wrapped

The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close

A bundle burglary with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray

Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals right from the start
That'll rip out your heart and consume the fattest part

Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant he was so far from free

Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast

Aiyo, pop, pop, pop, pop, when it shots whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game

Some nigga got, knifed up brawlin
Heard the kid was 19, Lil' Infinity too
His father worked up at the dealer he loved boo
They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't havin it though
Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue
Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceeded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap
Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flamin cause he related to you

[Ghostface]
Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealin my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me
Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbin all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot hisself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holdin his nuts, screamin ""God damnit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all lookin at me for?
Call the police, do somethin
Motherfuckers standin around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red
I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that
But anyway son indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies
Swore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it
Yo Lord I knocked out his teeth
Now he's rockin those false joints like everything's peace",Dogs of War,2006

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Niggaz got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
... if I go they got to go
Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid

[Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)
Workin out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
Uh-huh

Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't taking no shorts, its just the early 80's

Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job

Sidewinding niggas tryna infiltrate blindside
A nigga hit you wit the eight, three in the club
Dumbing out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop ones out, five dollars for bitches wit the guns out
Juggle for a couple days close shop thinking,
To you the bubble until the strip is hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel all my spare time and keep niggas wit us
To push shit like George Jefferson Airline
No fro niggaz better go chill, 'fore this gun
Goes up your nose like coke sniffing up your nose dude

Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction

But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is

Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break, I can't revive

In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four
Five clip, filled with the spiral tip

I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggaz approach me

Like the blind, death, dumb, whose mind was left numb
A non be Boy nigga couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started MC'ing, I entered the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I becoming with too much to measure

With the math of an elder and the steel of a welder
The path of tray that I had laid down and held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope

Supreme deluxe edition, cream with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison

Twenty-two year old, Dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby, moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body now, he stuck in another prison

When you see it, you better acknowledge your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours, pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw

Why try to fuck with these lecturers?
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. family and more one

They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land

He blew out the belt drive, MC's they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation

But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn

Them, Clansmen are the nucleus of hiphop
There's no room for error, M see's will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser

The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone

The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces and driven back

It is very dangerous to make a raid
With the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack",Advance Pawns,2007

Hey yo, what up party people (Yeah, my name's on the guest list)

Hey yo, my rose was good, plus my face was good
The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood
And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good
The grasp who be hypecast is good
That's the bird that fucked the game up
Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
Cause they shit is too fat like an Adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

Haven't seen him since he pushed Humpty Da-Dumpty fell off the fence 
The smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle toe Jeckle at min,
They took my medicade card, he's a good friend

And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons
Bet you ""my golly, oh glory"" with a story to tell

And the cat too, old girl who's clackin' her shoes
And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at school
It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs in Jellystone Park
Kermit had the whip, he did from the Narks
They bagged Woody, Shaggy shot dead in his hoodie
Tweety did the Bird, ""I thaw, I thought I thaw a putty""
Ghost, please you don't even want to know
Droopy Long wrote a song, like to hear it, here it go
Ricochet Rabbit had a habit, he was savage
Bruto slapped, Magoto slapped out his glasses backwards
Magelity used to come to class wit rachets
He was known in the hood, plus good for his classics
Slashes, blast four-fifths, diamond cut, hollow point tips
Big Boy bustin' out his corderoy fix
Eleven, way beyond is little boy fit
Magoo, he gon' catch him at the teachers' conference
So later that week durin' open school night
Everybody there, saw open school fight
Blows is big, Olive Oil was pissed
The wolf was too, they murdered one of the pigs
He said, ""What great big heat you have""
He replied, ""Fuck my gun I'll eat you fast""
He said, ""What great big teeth you have""
""Mothafu, you better look at all the beef you have""

Why I would damage you, fuck, if I drink, then ran with you
Y'all chose to war, so called rich niggas wanna verse the poor
I'll rob you first, then go to your earth, it's not gon' hurt
If you try calling the cops, it's not goin' work
All you gotta do is lay in the dirt, we dug a hole
And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert
With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan
With rhymes, and y'all can't believe it's not butter

Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a Tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards
Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards
Peace Lord, how your physical?

He upstate miserable
Stressed, doin' a thousand sets
But yo check the visuals
I'm at this hotel in Queens
Me and Charene getting' slow necked
That's live, I couldn't finish the bean
Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne
But you know what, Flaco meets Lolita
Flew in, she from Medellin, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks
Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks
Y'all got beef for life now 'cause that bitch is a trick

Ay yo fuck that, close the gate

And lower the shade
Then a shot popped off

Hit lil' bro in his fade
And then I see him dropped his clippers

He dipped with the quickness
It was Lolita black down yo

With four other bitches
He had a nasty hammer, fat ass

Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was a ninety shot

She lit up the cameras
And then I bugged out, ran up the steps

Yo I got hit in the leg

He shot back, hit one bitch in her breast
Under the pinball game aimin'

It's foggy and rainin'

My jewels is clangin'

Yo Tone tuck your chain in
She shootin' like she wanted a payment
Throwin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'

Hold that! Motherfucka
Yea! You on Staten Island now nigga

Aiyo, I'm skinned up, Nikes is scuffed, still bugging
Earlier, around four, how I escaped the bus
The way I fell, cracked the face of my watch, my man's chanting me on
Like run, son, don't go up in the spot
Jetting through bushes and backyards, neighbors is ratting me out
Dogs is barking all you hear is the cars
Sirens, I'm trying to think, and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats, got me running funny, you think I'm lying
May God strike me, if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's pounding through my chest
Trying to focus, yup, and make progress
That's what I get for slinging in them projects
Next thing you knew, I'm in this bitch's crib, chilling
Told 'em my story, you'll like this, I had her legs in the ceiling
Cooking me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doing this, the bitch still sliding on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she cracking the Dutch
Playing with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here, miss Lady Wop, where you put the condom box
You finished off the last one, oh shit, I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed the white yorkie
Jetting up the steps, and pig want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like 'ooh', I seen my man Meth going in raw
So he jumped up, balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dying laughing, he said ""Yo, Starks, be quiet""

[Method Man]
And let me put my drawers on, nigga, what dope you on, shit?
Should of knocked, before you came in the spot, Ghost, you wrong
Busting in here on that government shit, got the chick screaming
Grabbing the sheets, trying to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughing, son, I bumped my toe all the nice things
Just run and try to grab the gun
Cuz shit's real, man, you spazzing dunn
There come a time in a man's life, he got to toss his pack and run
You know he family like Crack and Pun, but Mr. G.F.K.

Now can it be that you hot, lord, you did some shit on the block
That the cops trying to lock you for
Can't believe you blowing the spot, lord, my chick is bugging
You tripping, my dick keep slipping out my boxer drawers

Police is hitting every corner we on

He steamed pam brought it back to penny on good times
Back in the dollar bill he sniffed like six lines
He put his gat down, why he do that?
Creeping through the crib is maxine pot holdin' down with the grits
Pam sucking his dick, maxine al greened him screaming slipped in piss
He ran into ceas' room, grits down cryin' aight with his balls out
He stepped on clarences' biggie smalls album
Mooney get that niggaz, pam yelling rip that niggaz
Mooney went and got that dye out the kitchen
James jumped on moon, poked him with a screw driver
Broke the tv niggaz watching knight rider

This is pam jerkins mother house the same shit go on in her brother house

He only had two hundred dollars worth of shit
And the kids tore his ass up, the ceas had a huddle up

Jumped on him pigeon toed moony poured dye on him
You should've seen his motherfuckin' face fryin', half dyin'
They stuck a fork through his nuts
The little girl was happy she beat the brotha up
Quick pick the window up mooney over heard
Right before they threw him out the nigga said word!? !

On the count of three he landed on the first floor balcony
Blood brains splashed.. he was dead? and the cops never came

Yo man, you gotta understand, this shit is real though man
All the time, word, yo man, that's you man
Yo peace Rae, peace God

Whassup baby? God damn, look at you man
Damn God, I got a shit out you man
Man, I done watched you man
Since you was a little crumb snatcher
A little weed-hopper running around here man

Look at you baby, you look good
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations
But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby
A good listener's a good learner
(G O D's my reality)

I see you listened very well, understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is coming baby
See sometime, it could be like, a rear view
You know what I'm sayin'?
And people don't know when their blessing comes

But I watch you grow, man you is a very intelligent man
Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would
Trick me out my money shootin' dice, niggaz is you crazy?

Crazy you crazy man
Yo Rae, you remember that shit man?
When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?

He'd be yelling, ""You little slick ass""
Ha ha ha ha
Talk to me baby, know what I'm sayin'?
Ha ha ha ha
I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin' you growin'

But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you
The child you was is making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from baby
You damn sure know that you don't know where you going
Can you see what I'm saying? Know which way you traveling

You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free

Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's duckin'
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catchin', rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy

Day one, in my spot July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin' up Devine's hittin' them with nines
I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife

It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though
Then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin' to war, you know we headed to the floor
He woulda, did it, for me fuck it, let's mosie

Schemin' dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin' in my mic, ""Yo we gotta go""
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even
Show your gun and blow the session?

He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yellin', ""Them niggaz sellin' two for fives""
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feedin' my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters

Yeah, Rae baby
Feedin' my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)

I'll say it one time, and be certain that fake God does not exist
(Oh, G O D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale

Of divine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
Of solid knowledge, no man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness

See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad

Raekwon,"Pss, yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G.
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

[Chorus]

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy

Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it

Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw

Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage ya whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down

And you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan

Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown

Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga

New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You want to bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game

Trying to get a clutch at what I could not

Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth

To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth

Raekwon,"Tommy Mottola, lives on the road
He lost his lady, two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh wonder that love

Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over

One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime
We passin it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine
Swallow nine, model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doo-doo makers stuffed inside pajamas

They'll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile, hey baby
They'll love you one second, then hate you the next
Oh ain't it crazy baby, yeah
Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, whoa, yeah (Blow 'em down God)
Now he's alone, he's just the king of his throne (Yeah, aha)
Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah (Truly yours, peace boo)",Cherchez Laghost,2008
Raekwon,"Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture 
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector 
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot 
About to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV 
For cheesy, too many want to be hard be easy 
It's all N'together, going all out together 
It don't take much to please me 
Still homes I'm never satisfy like the Stones 
We don't condone bitin' see them selling crossbones 
Protecting what I'm writing 
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license 
To kill rap reciting 
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the Group Home 
Tical! (Fuck your lifestyle!) 
Put your lights out 
Get the shit to crackin' got you feenin' with your pipes out 
Time for some action, surfin' the avenue 
Mad at you, where I used to battle crews 
Back when Antoinette had that attitude 
Cover me I'm going in, walls closing in 
Got us bustin' off these pistols 
My niggas got issues, again, same song 
Armed with the mega bomb 
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone.

Yo, I was going too but we roam, cellular phones 
Doc-Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones 
Don't condone, spent bank loans on homegrown 
Suckers break like Turbo in ozone 
When I, grab the broom 
Moon-walk platoon hawk my goons bark 
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true) 
Three nines and a glove with Nasu he dying in the car 
While we behind on the bars 
Haters don't touch (what?) weigh us both up 
Now my neighbor dope up 
Got the cable hooked up, all channels 
Lift my shirt all mammals 
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos

Sawed off shotgun 
Hand on the pump, sippin' on a forty 
Yo smokin' on a blunt 
Bust my gun and Red and Meth gettin' jumped 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah come on, Red and Meth gettin' jumped 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la",Da Rockwilder,2008
Raekwon,"Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waitin for the editin
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smokin Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
on July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushin fast
like runnin rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

Duel of the Iron Mic, it's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
when the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causin the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stingin somethin while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic
swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
any contender, testin the murderous Master
could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin for a serum, to cure em

Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin

Duel of the iron mics 
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes
Duel of the iron mics 
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes, nuh

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
They very art, that had raised them through such rapiant heights was lost
Their techniques, vanished",Duel of the Iron Mic,2008
