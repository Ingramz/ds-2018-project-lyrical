Horace Parlan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1974
Horace Parlan,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1975
Horace Parlan,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.",Come Sunday [#],1977
Horace Parlan,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1978
Horace Parlan,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1979
Horace Parlan,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
",When Lights Are Low,1979
Horace Parlan,"Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

How I wish, I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories of you

And your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories, just memories of you",Memories of You,1979
Horace Parlan,"Hush now don't explain
I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain",Ill Wind [Take 1][#],1979
Horace Parlan,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear",Spring Is Here,1979
Horace Parlan,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1980
Horace Parlan,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1980
Horace Parlan,"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!",Who Cares?,1981
Horace Parlan,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1983
Horace Parlan,"Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning when you find your heart a home
I've see it in the movies read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it but your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic 'till you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most when my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours when I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who could break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feelin' so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
",Take Good Care of My Heart,1984
Horace Parlan,"What can I do?
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure that 
You're the apple of my eye girl
Fulfillment of my dreams
Time, will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or 
Anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you 
There to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us 
Will all reveal in time

I tell you I love you
But you won't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or 
Anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you 
There to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do 

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us 
Will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us 
Will all reveal in time

Oh, that special love in us 
Will all reveal in time
So let you're little heart lay down my body",The Time Will Reveal,1984
Horace Parlan,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1991
Horace Parlan,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,1992
Horace Parlan,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on

Horace Parlan,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning

Horace Parlan,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it

Horace Parlan,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,1999
Horace Parlan,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2003
Horace Parlan,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low

Horace Parlan,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",2004
Horace Parlan,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Horace Parlan,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case

Horace Parlan,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2016
Horace Parlan Trio,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way

I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1957
Horace Silver Trio,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1957
Horace Tapscott,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1996
Horace Tapscott,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Porque la vida, la vida misma es todo un canto
Si se calla el cantor, muere de espanto
La esperanza, la luz y la alegría

Si se calla el cantor se quedan solos
Los humildes gorriones de los diarios,
Los obreros del puerto se persignan
Quién habrá de luchar por su salario

Que ha de ser de la vida si el que canta
No levanta su voz en las tribunas
Por el que sufre,´por el que no hay
Ninguna razón que lo condene a andar sin manta'

Si se calla el cantor muere la rosa
De que sirve la rosa sin el canto
Debe el canto ser luz sobre los campos
Iluminando siempre a los de abajo

Que no calle el cantor porque el silencio
Cobarde apaña la maldad que oprime,
No saben los cantores de agachadas
No callarán jamás de frente al crimen

Que se levanten todas las banderas
Cuando el cantor se plante con su grito
Que mil guitarras desangren en la noche
Una inmortal canción al infinito'

Antes de apagar la luz, cada vez que cierres tus ojos
Te diré cuanto te amo

A veces ni me la creo que te tenga aquí conmigo
Y que seas tan cariñosa, como yo lo soy contigo
Te mereces que te trate como toda un princesa
Para amarte yo he nacido

La inocencia en tu mirada me seduce fácilmente
Y escucharte cuando me hablas al oído a mi me prende
Por que nunca había sentido lo que hoy siento contigo
No te aparto de mi mente

Eres tu quien ha llenado mis mañanas de alegría
La que a diario me motiva, sin tu amor no se que haría
Así pasaran los años, voy a estar siempre a tu lado
Voy a ser ese hombre bueno, con el que siempre has soñado
Antes de apagar la luz, cada vez que cierres tus ojos
Te diré cuanto te amo",Te Diré Cuanto Te Amo,2015
Horacio Palencia,"No me pidas que te deje de amar como si fuera tan fácil 
No me digas que lo nuestro fue 
Solo algo pasajero 

Si en mis labios todavía me queda 
El sabor de tus besos 
No me digas que no era verdad 
Que todo era un juego

Y ahora dices que no 
Que no te importa continuar en este viaje 
Que iniciamos tú y yo 

Que te despides que te olvide para siempre 
A pesar de mi dolor 
En qué cabeza cabe que de un día para otro 
Se me acabe este amor, por Dios

No se qué más decir 
Pero bendigo cada beso cada abrazo 
Cuando te entregaste a mí 
Al fin y al cabo tú estarás con quien decidas 
No te pienso detener 

Si alguien más pudo ganar tu corazón 
Lo felicito bien por él, yo sé perder
Aunque no pierdo la esperanza de que un día 
Sientas ganas de volver

When an arm reach out to grab the supreme

And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put them in your wallet next to your money

Horror Show,"In her car six hours long,
Whisper words song after song
Eyes wide shut we sat and stare,
Long loss sought OH! life's unfair!
We always want we can't have
And we always lose,
So were always sad grade school crush
Blood soaked hair,
Four more hours and well there.
Utter words of importance,
When we forget to say.
She likes me, I love her
But they always go away wishful thinking,
Lost train of thought,
Shattered dreams broke
From the start ""desperate yells"",
""cries for help"" we do it ourselves.
What we always want we'll never have..
Cause we want too much
What is love and what's it like?
One one zero off the mass pike
Irony floods the car like air,
Hope and pray that she is there",Boston,2002

They always have.
Some at my side,
They never left the fights,
The drinks, the youth..
They've passed, still in my heart.
Always thinking back
Reminicse the arguments,
The innocence days grew cold,
They always do
...stay gold...
I'll see you soon
They've gone but not for long
This is my ode.
To the kids, who fought side by side
To the kids, who would talk and stay up all night.
To the kids, who made up our lives
To the kids, who fought and lost to time...

My friend Julia, she hasn't got a clue

Your every little desire
You slept in my arms
And you sucked from lips
And when everything
Was taken

I never cared for guns
But that night I opened 
The bar keepers box
And I shot you both down
A bloody mess of fire
Was all my heart desired

Eye for an eye
You sucked my heart dry
Now I'm taking what is mine
Lie upon lie
No more hurting crimes
What's left
Is for you to cry, oh cry
You sealed my heart with a kiss
Now I'm taking what it needs

No longer will I cry
I'm taking back what is mine.",S.O.B.,2005

Did it all in the hood, had to leave

No ambition to be something new to possibility.
Scanning all the heads, searching all the hearts,
Looking out for something that set one apart.
Didn't know what I hoped for,
Wordless questions answered tenderly.
Success is an elusive goal
Climbing a grease-covered pole.
Mills and foundries derelict,
Skills and trades now obsolete.
Headlines carry fears for rising crime
With results of an away match last weekend.
Nothing could be finer,
Like new tubers blossoming in the sultry haze.
New together, spark to tinder,
Lightning up a hungry blaze.
Looking to defy, living to avenge,
A tired empty life to kick against.
Through the working week to deserved weekend,
Driven to a life money can't defend.
I know what I hoped for when I found you,
You were my beautiful escape.
Nothing could be finer than the summer
It was simply you and me.

Nothing could be finer,

Spell of a lowdown hit and run driver.
You only wanted to make your mark,
To write your name into the history
Of my heart.

But I get more wise to myself.
And I fall less for the dazzling jewel,
More the jewel in plain wrapping.

So hard at persuading.

In a better place than where
You came from.
And if all you hoped for 
Was destruction,
You've got a nerve and another thing comming.

In the wires of my hand I see my fate
Cold and mechanical squeaky with hate
It clicks whirls and is satisfied

To a path of mechanical sin
Turning away from the warmth of gold
To an empty machine that's broken and cold

Under an empty moon
The creatures stop their shake
And plan a quick escape

They're dancing on barbwire
Fraught with curdled screams
Messy skins and messy fluids
Paved a road to golden dreams

They move in a frenzy
Across their mothers' backs
Out into the open
They don't look back

HORSE the Band,"The blood of this family it mingles
With the clay in this stinking riverbed
I tie the boy down and tear his mother's gown
It's okay, she's already dead

I'll sell the boy and the horses
To the snake you cannot see

I cut open the white man
And take from his woman too
If it were up to me, all the white faces would bleed
Bleed and bleed and bleed, it's truth

Murder, it's murder
Murder, it's murder

Empty plains echo with empty screams
There's a wagon on the highland
A father and his girl, both are heading south
I tie the boy and the horses

Then you use the skills of the wolf
I don't use a bullet
Get close enough, I can use my knife
My knife

I cut open the white man
And take from his woman too
If it were up to me, all the white faces would bleed
Red's a better color, it's truth

Let the blood out, let it flow
Cut the blood out, let it flow
Kill the blood out, let if flow
Like a river let it flow

Let it flow like a river
Let it flow like a river
Let if flow like a river into the sea

HORSE the Band,"Waking up in New York City
Dreaming about how it all began
Bright lights, big city
New Amsterdam and the Indians
You called me in tears
And it looks like rain

I walk south
Through our playground
Civilization's honeycomb

Taxi, taxi, taxi
Warm and pungent seats
Take me across the bridge
I can't be late

I'm heavy with you
Through cold morning avenues
Rushing with the rabble
Under gluttonous swelling skies

I'll come to you
Over clandestine sidewalks
I'll come to you
Crashing through dead leaves

Crashing, I'll come to you
And the cracks in the sidewalks
I'll come to you, crashing

Well, and the crosswalk says stop
Yet there you are
Trust the flicker of a picture
Between the static of cars

And it's a relief
That these walls are so high
Like arms that hold us together
Waiting for a green light

Go, go, go, stop
Go, go, go, stop
We embrace in the heart of our city
On wet broken sidewalks we're free

In a war between the sheets.
But when he brought his bull to her
It meant a woman making war
Beyond the eiderdown.

Told her that she would love again.

Called men to war in hide and bronze.

Ireland's most exciting saga is, undoubtedly, Tain Bo Cuailgne ( The
Cattle Raid of Cooley ), the centerpiece of the Ulster cycle of Heroic
Tales.
Normally referred to as ""The Tain"", it deals with the conflict between 
The forces of Connacht and Ulster for possession of a prize bull.
The events of the Tain are estimated to have taken place in Ireland 
Approximately 500 B.C. The earliest written version of the Tain known
To us is contained in the Book of the Dun Cow, which dates from the 12th
Century. Before this the story was kept alive by storytellers.
Two other manuscript versions are also available; the 12th century Book
Of Leinster and the 14th century Yellow Book of Lecan. The Tain, as
Ireland's equivalent of the Aeneid, has long intrigued historians, academics
And writers",Charolais,1974

Horslips,"Mad Pat

There was a country fiddler, 
A jester, a riddler, a joker, 
A singer of songs, 
In every town he passed 
He'd stop to help the dancing master 
Entertain his straw-rope-foot throng 
And from a green cloth on his back 
He'd take his fiddle 
And some goodbye snow 
Now singing high, now murmuring low 
Now in the middle with his magic bow 
And all the people would know.

Mad Paddy's gone back on the road
A wire string fiddle is his only load,
He's kicking up turf everywhere he goes
And he's on his own.
From the houses all the people they stare
At his Horslips and his emerald green hair
You know he keeps on moving 
He just doesn't care
When he's on his own.	

First he'll play a slow, slow air 
So fair, to drive away your cares 
And bring a magic sleep 
Then the pace will quicken 
As you burst out of your slumber 
And find yourself up on your feet 
But then his magic tune will change 
To something strange, there's something wrong 
What's going on. 
And through the tears you cry 
You'll look, you'll sigh, you'll feel like dying 
'cause the fiddler's gone 
Mad Paddy's moving on.

Mad Paddy's gone back on the road 
A wire string fiddle is his only load 
He's kicking up turf everywhere he goes 
And he's on his own. 
In the corner there's a smile on his face 
His fancy is taking him to some distant place 
You know his tunes keep changing 
He can't keep the pace 
And he's on his own 
Mad Pat's on the road.

watching you walk to the door and walk away
what was I supposed to say change your mind

Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all, that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight 
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight 
And I would like to start all over again

Baby can I change my mind
'Cause I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my, my mind
'Cause I would like to start all over again with you girl",Can I Change My Mind,1990
Hortense Ellis,"You know, me and my woman
We’ve been goin’ through a lot of changes for about six months or so
It’s been real hard to talk to one another
You know a relationship ain’t nothin’ without communication

How we were lying in bed, the both of us lookin’ at the ceiling overhead
Eyes wide open about three O'clock in the mornin’

I said, ""Baby, we can’t go on this way""
She said, ""You’re right""
I said, ""I know you love me and I love you""
Then we start holding each other
And I felt a tear roll down my face

Last night me and my woman
We cried, cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with you, no
There ain’t nothin’ wrong with me, uh uh

We’re not the only people in the world
Who go through ups and downs
All we have to do is talk
We can work it out

Oh, oh, let me kiss your eyes
Let me wipe your tears away
Let me hold you tight
Tomorrow we’ll feel better ‘cause it’s a brand new day

Oh, last night me and my woman
We cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry, cry
We cry together, oh, oh

Now we had times when we'd laughed hearty
We’d even go out on the town and we’d party, party, party

Every day the sun doesn’t shine
Sometimes it has to rain
Just like we enjoy the pleasure
We have to stand the pain

Oh, let me kiss your eyes
Let me wipe the tears away
Oh, let me hold you close
Let’s talk to each other, I wanna hear what you gotta say

Oh, last night, sweet last night, me and my woman
We cried together
Said we cry, cry, cry
We cry together, together
And then we, and then we, and then we
And then we made love, love, love, ooh

Love like we never made love before
You know we stopped huggin’ each other and kiss
And I wiped the tears from my face
And I'm love all over the place
[Incomprehensible]

Said we cry
There's nothin’ wrong with you
And there ain’t nothin’ wrong with me
We’re not the only people in the world who go through ups and downs
And changes and turn arounds

De mon cœur
T'as fait un tabac
Je suis en quête du bonheur
Peut-être qu'il est dans tes draps
T'as piraté mon âme
Alors que je surfais sur la vague
Et j'ai tout raté, je rame
Alors que j't'avais dans ma madrague
Enlève tes bas ou tes hauts
T'es si jolie, tu me rends dingue
Je rêve que tu viennes sur mon bateau
Que toute les nuits on fasse la bringue
À bâbord ou à tribord, on partira à la dérive
Je veux ton corps, mon trésor
Je t'attends sur l'autre rive

Et sur ta marinière
Je cherche notre trait d'union
Tu l'as jeté à la mer
Pour donner à bouffer aux poissons
À nos poisons d'avril
Nous deux c'est pire que la mer à boire
Ne te découvre pas d'un fil
Tu rendrais amoureux ton miroir

Dans le brouillard du matin
J'ai porté sur mon dos

Ma vie comme mon fardeau
Qu'on cachait trop souvent
Qui nous brûle dedans

J'ai chialé dans les rues
J'étais brisée et déçue
Qu'on me lâche la main
Et qu'on n'me laisse rien
Que quelques rides sur le cœur
Et les miettes du bonheur
Que les pigeons apportent
Quand je suis presque morte

Pourtant j'ai gravé sur ma peau
À l'encre de mes mots

Il suffit d'y croire
Où que se cache l'espoir
Il suffit d'y croire
Et qu'importe ce que nous renvoie le miroir
Il suffit d'y croire
Tant pis pour les idées noires
On va pas éteindre le soleil
Ni les étoiles dans le ciel
Il suffit d'y croire, oh oh oh
Il suffit d'y croire, oh oh oh

J'ai aimé pour de vrai
J'ai livré tout mes secrets
J'ai juré pour la vie

Mais je crois bien qu'on m'a menti
J'ai tourné toute la nuit
J'ai cherché des réponses à la vie
Soûlés par mes questions
J'ai bien cru toucher le fond

Alors j'ai gravé sur ma peau
J'ai voulu trouver les mots

Il suffit d'y croire
Où que se cache l'espoir
Il suffit d'y croire
Et qu'importe ce que nous renvoie le miroir
Il suffit d'y croire
Tant pis pour les idées noires
On va pas éteindre le soleil
Ni les étoiles dans le ciel
Il suffit d'y croire, oh oh oh
Il suffit d'y croire, oh oh oh

Et même si j'ai mal au cœur
Et même s'il est un peu fêlé
Je sais j'ai commis des erreurs
Mais tout peut se réparer

Il suffit d'y croire, oh oh oh
Il suffit d'y croire, oh oh oh

Il suffit d'y croire
Où que se cache l'espoir
Il suffit d'y croire
Et qu'importe ce que nous renvoie le miroir
Il suffit d'y croire
Tant pis pour les idées noires
On va pas éteindre le soleil
Ni les étoiles dans le ciel

De mon cœur
T'as fait un tabac
Je suis en quête du bonheur
Peut-être qu'il est dans tes draps
T'as piraté mon âme
Alors que je surfais sur la vague
Et j'ai tout raté, je rame
Alors que j't'avais dans ma madrague
Enlève tes bas ou tes hauts

Que toute les nuits on fasse la bringue
À bâbord ou à tribord, on partira à la dérive

Je cherche notre trait d'union

Niggas smile in ya face, behind yo' back they back-stabbing
Laughing, talkin 'bout all ya business

How many guns you got, and where you go to cop

I seen it all, it went down in my town (Where, where?)
Called Queensbridge, where the fugitives live
Where some rap kids (Rap kids) can turn to big wigs (Big wigs)

Braggin to the nigga with the slice in his head
Now there's a price on his head
For pullin out on Lil Bro
Flashin his heat, he askin for beef
Conference call, ready to brawl
Caught him on a Blaz'a 
He breathing hard like he got asthma
Choice words he spoke, headed for disaster
Last to the gramma I spit
Told him ""Fuck you and whoever you get""
He's like ""Whatever kid""

Ay-yo who shot Rudy in broad daylight for cash?
I woke up this morning and hear the newsflash
They said it happened down at City Hall
He had his wife with I'm from the crowd made him fall
It was chaos and pandemonium blood covered up the podium
Covered his face, and wouldn't show me him
I had to see if it was true
Secret service was mad nervous, so was the boys in blue
Scatterin', like rats and ants, with the lights on
Man hunt the suspect all night long
Interrupted episodes, every channel show
Barricaded the city and blocked every road
Jakes in riot gear, blacks smilin' it is
Reporters cryin out in the street, ?""It ain't Rudy!""?
He ain't dead off, somebody blew his head off and skated out
Commissioner live on channel five when they announced his death
Wifey was stressed, she was right there
She stated: it was like a nightmare
One-time, was combing the streets, had the whole force on the beat
Flyin' in cars and on feet
The D's came through stompin'
Ghetto birds had the projects lookin' like Compton with marksmen
With dirty thirties out the window
I'm in my room smokin' boom, playin' Nintendo, high off the indo
Who shot Rudy?

[Chorus]
From courthouse to your house
Rich house to poor house
QB to Shaolin, Brooklyn Long Island
BX to Money Makin', YO and New Ro
The news final, yo, who shot Rudy?

They speculated it was mob related
Every wise guy with mafia ties, interrogated for lies
Every king and yeta, had the linguistics
Snatchin' they gats for ballistics and expert statistics
Were drawn out, gang unit was all worn out
Investigatin' his body and everybody else
Whoever gave threats, made bets or wages
Cash donators from the campaign stages
Cab drivers and frank vendors who protested
Were roughed up like Abner, gettin broom molested
Sharp lawyer suit-breasted, double-breasted reporters
Was mobbin' daughters and other mourners
Pushin' cameras away, blockin' the sights
Had the riot squad at Washington Heights
Kennedy Airport, stoppin' flights, niggaz was tight
Cause the couldn't sell a dime all night, but that was alright
The devil died and nobody cried
They was real like some Jews celebratin' when the pharaohe got killed
Glasses of Henny were spilled and we got twisted
Smokin' blunts on the corner like we used to cause we lived it
Knowin' he was gone for good ???, it got me thinkin'
Ay-yo, where the fuck Dinkens?
And Harlem World, Shaolin to Brownsville
Did Sharpton and Farrakhan make the shit real?
Was it Khalel? you know he keep mad steel
Did the Bloods or the Crips smoke Rudy on the hill

Hostyle," 

Players keep playin', haters keep hatin'
So much to say, so little time
For the hood that I pray
Haters I spit you die; slow; die; slow

Wash my hands in some in-scent smoke
Pull a leaf off a tree
Flip it over nothing innocent though
City split it over to me
Hennessey spilling over tenements of QB
It's real or more a day
Plenty of ways to die
Plenty of ways to survive
Plenty of ways gettin' high
Straight sip the innocent kind
And the rest unjustified with an alibi, normal racquets
Undercovers with heat in their slumber jackets
Government badges and colored stripe brackets
G's sittin' pretty like cash and (???)
Witty thugs play out; I obey the writer Ala
Swaying in and out, above and beyond
The humidity, really got me jittery
Cold like a barrel of ice
Dark shadows of life
I put my head on a pillow, di-do-do-ditto
What son say, you still know
I catch a chill flowing through my temple
It's real simple
Good faith, common sense, six-triple in the mix
Dippin' through quick aiming to get you; it's the click!

(Chorus)
For the thuns, each one to each one son
	Street life is all I know
Ways to move I pay dues; I'm talking to all of you
	Warfare is when you go
For the cash 'cause I reach for them... reach for them
	Street life is all I know
Full bellies and cellis, close enemies to siece memories
	Warfare is when you go

[Hostyle]
Yo..It's Hostyle ¿que pasa?
No masa; tu eres no problema
¿Cliente hah?
Drama with dada is dangerous
Bang with anguish; Flame with a touch
Deranged ain't enough
Gunpowder laying on my cuff
Call my bluff   
The streets don't stop; it's like a marry-go-round
The beats don't stop; multiply various rounds
Of hard knock, bar locked gates
These are the brakes
Family ties without a trace
Old G's...??? With sheets of casper toke
Premeditated plans later dated
Haters waited with iron plated heat
Designed, made miraculously dated in deep memory
So...keep countin' dollars
Keep mine moving scholars of rap
With a lot of gats; holla' back!

(Chorus)

You'll win by all means
Struggle for the cream
Hustle by ways of being
Don't let prophecy end
Don't let the Po-Po knock me again
Don't let the 'nine' cock freely in sin
Missiles through your flesh tissue... military issue
Guess you understand the risk you take
Dissed you on your forehead snake
More dead weight
Pitch fork love; It's for coke thugs
Bitches huffin' & puffin'; huffin' & puffin' about nothin'
Watch you say I hold against you in the court of law
Gun firing; wall to wall
(???) closed from burn holes
Fires turned on my stone... Fuck That!
'cause I gotta eat; pockets so swolled
From reasons of livin'
The breath I'm givin'
All the checks I'm scribblin'; it's real baby!

Hot,"Do you think I'm such a fool
To believe everything you say is true
That just goes to show
That you really don't know

And while you're out painting the town
Do you think I'm home just sitting around
Waiting on you
Now who's really the fool

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Why'd you slip around secretly 
If you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holding on
When love was already gone

The times you said you weren't feeling well
Did you think I couldn't tell
You'd been with someone else
You were only kidding yourself

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over

Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of

When I got that iron in my hand I'm goin' to slang it
When I got that drama on my mind I'm goin' to bring it
I ain't backin' down from no nigga that's nathan'
If the nigga say I ain't bout my business look here he hatin'

Coming uptown playboy we gonna slang it
If I catch down nigga bad we gonna leave ya stankin'
Fucking wit my H.B's nigga I'm gonna bring it
Rollin' uptown stay strap and keep thinkin'

Cause a nigga get stolen
Better yet get takin'
Paper is burn
They come fast, ya can't shake it
Picture this my brother Cash Money done went nation
That come's from seven hard years of dedication

Fuckin' with B.G. nigga
I'm puttin' on your face and I'm a kill me a nigga
That's believin' worth six figures we call hard hitters
We uptown riders and we real with this nigga, nigga

Police can investigate but they ain't gonna find shit
But a hundred bullet shells without a fucking fingerprint
This Hot Boy click laid back and spy on niggas
We see them workin' on somethin' look here we riders
Ain't like workin' niggas
Any block with a flussy
That goes for the boss too
We ain't got no picks to choose it
We get cha if we gotta
Wig split cha if we gotta
I know you ain't got word that B.G.'s a rider
So keep it on the D.L
If you got keys don't serve nobody but off V.L
Cause they play for keeps
A one way ticket to hizell
Six feet deep
It's a filthy dirty rizell
On the U.P.T
I was raised in the streets
But I put it on my mind
By the time I was nine
Look here nigga I was slangin' that nine

Now them them don't want us
They know me and Turk don't fuss in the corners
They already know that we brothers, Blood
Or whatever you wanna call it
Click up wit my dog we get crazy like alcoholics
Plus we ballers
So whatever we spin the Lex or Benz
Its gonna be on twenny, twen, twens

Get off the block when we come nigga (nigga)
To the lane
Shots that close shop when the bullets start spraying
Run your mouth too much, better watch what cha sayin'
Like a nigga on the sideline, nigga we ain't playin'

Na, Na, Na, Na
Now why O why Lord
The nigga wanna try and die Lord

Niggas wanna learn hard way
Give it to 'em like that
Make 'em suffer
Put that bitch wit a bag

I guess you probably standin' there sayin, ""Who's the muthafucka?""
Nigga Juv's the muthafucka, that'll bruise a muthafucka
Either there's been a lot of cross-firin' in the bricks
And I'm gonna kill me a nigga
If they put me in that shit
Look I'm gonna tell ya like I tell my folks
Play with me if you want but Cash Money goin' broke
Even if it means creepin' up slow
Bustin' out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no ho's
She could have had a girl for that
I been realized, I'm all in
Surrounded by the camouflage, in ballin'
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin'
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin', stop callin'
Cause ain't no peace treaties whodie
You better not leave that forty-five at your house cause you gonna need it whodie

I'll bet a guitar of gold to get your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny, it might be a sin
I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been

Johnny resin up your pick
And play your guitar hard
'Cause hell is here in Scunthorpe
And the devil deals the cards
Now if you win you'll get
This shinny guitar made of gold
But if you loose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And said I'll start this gig
And fire flew from his finger tips
As he resined up his pick
He strummed the pick across the strings
It made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
Let me show you how it's done

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden guitar
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil come on back 
If you ever want to try again
I told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best I've ever been

Cradle them in both our laps

But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining

The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots

Remain to love until they droop and die

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

I met a pretty girl when I was living on the road
She told me she’s never-ever leave 
I believed all them lies, and now her I do despise
And there was nowhere else that I would rather be

But on my way
He was wishing he was on his way 
Yeah, I was on my way
On his way back home

Well I’m old and fat and grey, and I’m walking with a cane

And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm

All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm

No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one

'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin':

Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

And that happy tune is your step

Am I too late to make amends?

And the moon'll hide its light

Sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong and he's right

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow

An' heard me some big talk

Five years she had waited for him as long as a woman can
As long as a woman can

   I don't know what changed my mind
   'Til then I was the rambling kind
   The kind of love I can't explain
   That I had for Nellie Kane

She hired me on to work that day to help her till the land
In the afternoon we planted seeds in the evening we held hands
In the evening we held hands

Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know
It was then I realized that I would never go   
That I would never go

I became a father to him and she became my all
She became my all

Verse One:
The chosen one, young lady never shady
Can't fade me, I'm gettin money
No dummy I'm actin funny, only true
thug niggaz with figures, six oh-oh's, I love them oh's
Peep' opposed, so I gotta get mine
The boy is mine, laid up in the whip
Gettin hit, that's the shit
Leanin to the back, gettin freaky like that
Who's fuckin with that, a 600 to a Hatch
Catch my flows, hittin you with low blows
Real chick on the side, take em for a long ride
Watchin my flicks, talkin slick

Smash you tricks, not your average chick
I cop guns and whips for you whores, mashin

Verse Two:
Girl I can't stand when he ain't around
He makes me nervous, takin trips out of town
to knock off this weight, but I truly understand
Money's sweet in Albany he gettin two hundred a gram
God forbid he get locked, or even worse bodied
What the fuck I'ma do, besides him I got nobody
Do he cheat? Probably, so what? I plays the mistress
in a see-through dress, then guess, what's in the chest

My man keeps me tight, dressed in the best
Nothin more nothin less, caressin, blessin never stressin
Laid back fessin, it's early mornin, break of dawn and
now I'm yawnin, I take a sneak peek
Still how sweet my man creeps in stash box I hear a knock
Who is it? He said Feds, I'm here to visit

Searchin my house, why them tricks had to run they mouth?

Nothing would ever, ever come to woe;
But that's all gone now and I don't worry;
What's the future for me and my friends;
Well, I just don't know.
Cause living is with us until it is gone;
Once it has left us, the believers don't know;
But I'm still alive now and I don't worry;
When I go down, don't let me go slow!

It was a message that was written in air;
I'd rather be lost now, than following nothing;
Than feeling and thinking, unable to care.",Ode for Billy Dean,1972

Falling down like summer rain;

In our less uncommon way.
Through your hair across my eyes,
The twilight shafts in soft surprise;
Reminds me once again how nice,
It is to be with you.",Sea Child,1972

Ever since i left my way
Still I like to be beside you
So, tell me, can I stay? Beside you

I want you so much

When you smile at me in the morning
And it's been so long since I felt at home in your love

Was it time I, once came running
Down the streets we used to melt
That was when I still had something
Special love for me to give, unto you

See your smile
Laughing, look at me
When you held me tight in the morning
And it's been so long since I felt at home in your love

The hourglass has just begun.
Life was meant for having fun
As we were meant to be.

I've been living blind in one-eyed land,
Among those kings I thought were grand,
Till time had opened up my eyes
And there I found, to my surprise,
That life without you
Was empty as a nest in winter light.
Strolling in the garden,
Sunshine on a California day,
With you by my side.
The tears we've cried have dried and gone away.
The darkness of the northland,
In wintertime, has all began to run
Through the deltas of a passing sorrow,
Now that you and I are really one.
Now we're flying down the way
Where all our hopes have time to stay,
And we can marvel at the time
That floats us in it's path.

Sleeps a nervous dream.
Circled so fine, like a velvet palace,
Whiles away the passing hours;
Not being what he seems.
Then he creeps into the light;
Speeding up like fire flight,
Now he moves across the forest floor.
Send away the pace of time;
Leave behind the lonely mine,
And the diamond brilliant on the floor.
We cannot stay by the crystal mountain;
Serpent of dreams has left his shadow lair;
Diamond remains, brilliant in its cavern;

We will train our blue-eyed men

Stop wasting time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you

The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy, get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

But you grow up and you calm down
Working for the clampdown
You start wearing blue and brown
Working for the clampdown

So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now

He is warm and everything is new
And everything is clean and everything is free 
And there were still so many things to see
So many things still left to be

Of high and mighty things
Your fascination for larger than life
Your brand new appetite, as though we'd invented it

That remembers things, perhaps as they should've been
Rather than lies, rather than the cruelty
That sometimes we were guilty of and as everyone knows
We were only young and really couldn't have known
We were very young and it's nice to know there's a place to go 
And still so many things left to see

Through all this time, how have I returned?

None survived who went alive
Over the waterfall, boys
Over the waterfall

So I built myself an oaken barrel
And inside I did crawl
I broke the record but I broke my back
Going over the waterfall

And it's been my luck to live to tell
The only tale I can
It don't hurt you when you fall
Only when you land, boys
Only when you land",Over the Waterfall,1991
Hothouse Flowers,"I saw her today at the reception 
A glass of wine in her hand 
I knew she was gonna meet her connection 
As at her feet was a footloose man

But if you try sometimes 
You just might find 
You'll get what you need 

I went down to the demonstration 
To get my fair share of abuse 
Singing ""we're gonna vent our frustrations"" 
""And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse""

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore 
To get your prescription filled 
I was standing in line with Mister Jimmy 
And man, did he look pretty ill 
We decided that we would have a soda 
My favorite flavor, was cherry red 
I sung my song to Mister Jimmy 
And he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""

Hothouse Flowers,"Well, we went out past the city limits
Trying to get a better point of view
You were staring hard at me
I was staring back at you

And you said I was being secretive
Said, yes maybe you're right
But if there is logic in any of this madness
You'll find it in my eyes

And be good, be kind, be truthful and feel free
And keep your wholly loving eyes on me

I've got a history of questions
The truth I can only feel
What matters to me the most
Is what is there and what is real

We could start by shaking each other
And talk about something else
And I know in the end we can get to the point
And we can go and get some rest

And be good, be kind, be truthful and feel free
And keep your wholly loving eyes on me

Is it not written in the music?
Is it not painted in the skies?
It's time we stopped talking about soft drinks
Started talking about our lives

There are answers in the music
And there are answers in the words
And if we stopped talking in circles
We might get closer to the earth

And be good, be kind, be truthful and feel free
And keep your wholly loving eyes on me
",Be Good,1993
Hothouse Flowers,"Blazing eyes, bareback horses
And a redhead smile
I'm tempted strongly, strongly tempted
By the call of the wild

Going to the gypsy fair
I'm gonna find some freedom there
I wanna dance 'til I don't care
At the gypsy fair, at the gypsy fair

Are coffee stains the
Total color of my mind
I see a plane I look up and I wonder
If it should be flying

Going to the gypsy fair
I'm gonna find some freedom there
I wanna dance 'til I don't care
At the gypsy fair, at the gypsy fair

Legend written not written
Only passed on through time
Of a people walking, walking people
And they're dreaming of flying

Going to the gypsy fair
I'm gonna find some freedom there
I wanna dance 'til I don't care
At the gypsy fair, at the gypsy fair

Going to the gypsy fair
I'm gonna find some freedom there
I wanna dance 'til I don't care
At the gypsy fair, at the gypsy fair

That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me

That's where you'll find me
Find me daily
That's where you'll find me
",Gypsy Fair,1993
Hothouse Flowers,"Have you been touched
By the spirit of the land?
From a far away call
Into the palm of your hand

It's inside every woman
And it's inside every man
It's time to look and listen
To know and understand

The news is getting further
And the word is getting round
We will end another people
If we keep taking from the ground

You'll see it in the symbols
And the songs with ancient sounds
You'll find it all connected
If you take the time to look around
Look around

There's a gathering of races
And a gathering of soul
There'll be a choosing of directions
And a distribution of roles

Earth is Turtle Island
And air is Isle of Green
Water is in India
And fire is Aborigine
",Spirit of the Land,1993
Hothouse Flowers,"He has been living through the pages of our time
Known as a true man, pure and sublime
Comes from the earth and out of the skies
From the four corners of the compass and into our lives

He is followed, he who is true
To what there is to be believed in, to the spirit of you
Comes from the day and out of the night
It's in all things natural, it's in all things right

Oh sometimes, it's just not that easy
Oh sometimes, I got to call you, call you

Stand beside me, God, stand beside me
Stand before me and behind me
So I can follow in love

And it all sails so smoothly with a prayer at each hand
We all carry our stones, our good books
On the Holy ground, we stand true to the day, true to the night
It's got to be natural, it's got to be right

Oh sometimes, it's still not that easy
No, sometimes, I'm not the man I think I am
Feel I am, hope I am, know I am

Stand beside me, stand beside me
Stand before me and behind me
So I can be true, so I can be true to my word

Stand beside me, stand beside me
Stand before me, stand beside me
",Stand Beside Me,1993
Hothouse Flowers,"You sang so softly
I closed my eyes
Like snowfall on the water
I, the only child

You had been walking
And your skin was cold
You took the night with you

And I was enthralled
By the power of the light
And the sound of the changing tide of your nature

And it was evening, I saw my breath
I was needing to hear your tenderness
I was blinded by the sight
The power of the changing tide of your nature

Stay singing softly
You take me home
Like a slow boat on the water
Like an old stone

I was blinded by the sight
And the power of the changing tide
Blinded by the night
The sweet sound of the changing tide of your nature
",Your Nature,1993
Hothouse Flowers,"At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh yeah yeah, at last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known, oh yeah yeah

You smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known, oh yeah

You smiled you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

At last
At last
",At Last,1998
Hothouse Flowers,"Is it a garden waiting to grow
Is it a secret that nobody knows
Is it a poison or is it a cure
Contaminated when you think that it's pure
Born live on the air
At a tv station with the whole world there
Born holding your hand
Spinning the big wheel with the studio band
Will you be true or will you be false
Is it an omen or is it a curse
Will it be early or will it be late
Is it a dead end or is there a gate
Born live on the air...
Will you be here or some place else
Will you be tired or will I have to dance
Will you be sexy will you lie on the floor
Or will you forget completely what I came here for
Born live on the air...
Have you been drinking or is it your scent
There's so many bottles is your money all spent
Is there a corner to put all this mess
You'd think you were lazy, please undress
Born live on the air...
",Born,1998
