Joni Mitchell,"It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make up mirror
Liquid soap and grass

And jungle gardenia crash
On pine sol and beer
It's stifling in here
I've got to get some air
I'm going outside to get some air

Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down
They're such sky oriented people
Geared to changing weather
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off, I'm floating off in time

When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's general store
All in their beaded leathers

I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum, I'd beat the drum like war

But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off, I'm floating into my dreams

I dream Paprika plains
Vast and bleak and god forsaken
Paprika plains and a turquoise river snaking

The rain retreats like troops to
Fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet
Talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor

I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J and B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back, I'm coming back for more

The band plugs in again you see that mirrored ball
Begin to sputter lights and spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back, I'm floating back to you

Joni Mitchell,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on",River,2005
Joni Mitchell,"The cats are in the flower bed
A red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy
Just to be alive...
But we have poisoned everything
And oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble
Through the shopping malls
While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

You cannot be trusted
Do you even know you're lying
It's dangerous to kid yourself
You go deaf and dumb and blind.
You take with such entitlement.
You give bad attitude.
You have no grace
No empathy
No gratitude

You have no sense of consequence
Oh my head is in my hands...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

Before that altering apple
We were one with everything
No sense of self and other
No self-consciousness.
But now we have to grapple
With our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.

And everyone's a victim!
Nobody's hands are clean.
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth
So near the jaws of our machines.
We live in these electric scabs.
These lesions once were lakes.
No one knows how to shoulder the blame
Or learn from past mistakes...
So who will come to save the day?
Mighty Mouse?
Superman?
Bad dreams are good in the great plan.",Bad Dreams,2007
Joni Mitchell,"So they paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel
A boutique
And a swinging night spot.
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees
Put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged all the people
An arm and a leg just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

Hey farmer
Put away your DDT
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
And they put up a parking lot.

Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi come and took away my old man.
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.",Big Yellow Taxi (2007),2007
Joni Mitchell,"Hana steps out of a storm
Into a stranger's warm, but
Hard-up kitchen.
She sees what must be done
So she takes off her coat
Rolls up her sleeves
And starts pitchin' in.

Hana has a special knack
For getting people back on the right track
'Cause she knows
They all matter
So she doesn't argue or flatter
She doesn't fight the slights
She takes it on the chin
Like a champ

Hana says when life's a drag
Don't cave in
Don't put up a white flag
Raise up
A white banner
In this manner-
Straighten your back
Dig in your heals
And get a good grip on your grief!

Hana says, ""Don't get me wrong
This is no simple Sunday song
Where God or Jesus comes along
And they save ya.""
You've got to be braver than that
You tackle the beast alone
With all its tenacious teeth!
Light the lamp.",Hana,2007
Joni Mitchell,"If you can keep your head
While all about you
People are losing theirs and blaming you
If you can trust yourself
When everybody doubts you
And make allowance for their doubting too.

If you can wait
And not get tired of waiting
And when lied about
Stand tall
Don't deal in lies
And when hated
Don't give in to hating back
Don't need to look so good
Don't need to talk too wise.

If you can dream
And not make dreams your master
If you can think
And not make intellect your game
If you can meet
With triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same

If you can force your heart
And nerve and sinew
To serve you
After all of them are gone
And so hold on
When there is nothing in you
Nothing but the will
That's telling you to hold on!
Hold on!

If you can bear to hear
The truth you've spoken
Twisted and misconstrued
By some smug fool
Or watch your life's work
Torn apart and broken down
And still stoop to build again
With worn out tools.

If you can draw a crowd
And keep your virtue
Or walk with Kings
And keep the common touch
If neither enemies nor loving friends
Can hurt you
If everybody counts with you
But none too much.

If you can fill the journey
Of a minute
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight
Then
The Earth is yours
And Everything that's in it
But more than that
I know
You'll be alright
You'll be alright.

Cause you've got the fight
You've got the insight
You've got the fight
You've got the insight",If,2007
Joni Mitchell,"Holy war

Joni Mitchell,"The tour bus came yesterday
The driver's a mess today
It's a dump of a destiny
But it's got a view...
Now the kid in the see-through blouse
Is moving in hard on his holy vows...
Since the preacher's not dead
Dead drunk will have to do!

Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets?
The widow is dancing
Down on the beach

The starlight is steaming
He'd like to be dreaming
His senses are screaming
Not to be denied...
But if the spell of the night should win
He could lose his bus
For the same sweet sin
That took his church from him
Then how will he survive?

Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets?
It's the widow and her lover-boys
Down on the beach

The night is so fragrant
These women so flagrant
They could make him a vagrant
With the flick of a shawl.

With no help from God at all",Night of the Iguana,2007
Joni Mitchell,"Oh let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on Wall Street and Vegas
Place your bets
Shine on the fishermen
With nothing in their nets
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies
Shine on science
With its tunnel vision
Shine on fertile farmland
Buried under subdivisions

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on the dazzling darkness
That restores us in deep sleep
Shine on what we throw away
And what we keep

Shine on Reverend Pearson
Who threw away
The vain old God
kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven
And fresh plowed sod
Shine on good earth, good air, good water
And a safe place
For kids to play
Shine on bombs exploding
Half a mile away

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on world-wide traffic jams
Honking day and night
Shine on another asshole
Passing on the right!
Shine on the red light runners
Busy talking on their cell phones
Shine on the Catholic Church
And the prisons that it owns
Shine on all the Churches
They all love less and less
Shine on a hopeful girl
In a dreamy dress

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on good humor
Shine on good will
Shine on lousy leadership
Licensed to kill
Shine on dying soldiers
In patriotic pain
Shine on mass destruction
In some God's name!
Shine on the pioneers
Those seekers of mental health
Craving simplicity
They traveled inward
Past themselves...
May all their little lights shine",Shine,2007
Joni Mitchell,"Strong and wrong you win--
Only because
That's the way its always been.

You lose everything
Without the heart

Gone!
All I hear are crows in flight
Singing might is right
Might is right!

Oh the dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years
And here we are...
Still worshiping
Our own ego

Strong and wrong
What is God's will?

Just a lucky paw

Joni Mitchell,"Sparkle on the ocean
Eagle at the top of a tree
Those crazy crows always making a commotion
This land is home to me.

I was talking to my neighbor
He said, ""When I get to heaven, if it is not like this,
I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming right back down here
Back to this heavenly bliss.""

You see those lovely hills
They won't be there for long
They're gonna tear 'em down
And sell them to California
Here come the toxic spills
Miners poking all around
When this place looks like a moonscape
Don't say I didn't warn ya...

Money, money, money...
Money makes the trees come down
It makes mountains into molehills
Big money kicks the wide wide world around.

Black bear in the orchard
At night he's in my garbage cans
He's getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him
He's got a right to roam this land.

I feel like Geronimo
I used to be as trusting as Cochise
But the white eyes lies
He's out of whack with nature
And look how far his weapons reach!

Spirit of the water
Give us all the courage and the grace
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding
The genius to save this place.",This Place,2007
Joni Mitchell,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",The Long Black Veil [DVD],2007
Joni Mitchell,"Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds

Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
That's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there

Joni Mitchell,"I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin' all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of, the beat of black wings

""They gave me a gun,"" he said
""They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory
Propaganda, piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me
I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of, the beat of black wings.""

He said, ""I never had nothin'
Nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grievin'!
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin', damn!
She'd been to some clinic
Oh--the beat of black wings.""

""They want you, they need you
They train you to kill
To be a pin on some map
Some vicarious thrill

That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars

To the beat of, the beat of black wings.""

On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em

I'm just the beat of black wings.""",The Beat of Black Wings [DVD],2009

Joni Mitchell,"I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Did you get a round resounding for you
Way up here
It seems like many dim years ago
Since I heard that face to face
Or seen you face to face
Though tonight I can feel you here
I get these notes
On butterflies and lilac sprays
From girls who just have to tell me
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet
And he trembles as he sings
And he asks some guy
To circulate his soul around
On your mark red ribbon runner
The caressing rev of motors
Finely tuned like fancy women
In thirties evening gowns
Up the charts
Off to the airport-
Your name's in the news
Everything's first class-
The lights go down-
And it's just you up there
Getting them to feel like that

Remember the days when you used to sit
And make up your tunes for love
And pour your simple sorrow
To the soundhole and your knee
And now you're seen
On giant screens
And at parties for the press
And for people who have slices of you
From the company
They toss around your latest golden egg
Speculation-well, who's to know
If the next one in the nest
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful
With my teeth sunk in the hand
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here
The critic!
And they introduce some band
But they seem so much confetti
Looking at them on my TV set

Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers
And the boards
And the nails

That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than live

That he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not, oh no

I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know

I knew that this was meant to be

When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

They're either going to thaw out or freeze

Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees

I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

I know, no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality, to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

Joni Mitchell,"The water is wide, I cannot cross over,
And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The seagulls wheel, they turn and dive,
The mountain stands beside the sea.
This world we know turns round and round,
And all for them - and you and me.",The Water Is Wide,2016

Constantly in the darkness

In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
And I sketched your face on it twice

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter 
But you taste so sweet oh
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling 
Still be on my feet
i Still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time that you told me, you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine 'cause
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter 
And you taste sweet oh
I could drink a case of you, I could drink a case of you darling 
Still I'd be on my feet
I still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said
Go to him
Stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed

Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine
Oh you taste so bitter 
You taste sweet oh
I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I still be on my feet

Brand new the past is gone and the future's
Here for you this Christmas
The world's a little kinder too cause everybody
Observes the golden rule at Christmas

Love's unconditional and we're all emotional because
Our hearts have been made new. Love's unconditional and
We're all emotional because or hearts have been made new

Give thanks to God for where He's brought us from
He's given us blessings, He's given us His son this

I know better that love is what we need at Chirstmas

Joni Twitty,"Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Savin' all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true

Joni was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess 10 years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Savin' all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true

Slowly I read her note once more
Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say

Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just fifteen I'm twenty two
Joni I just can't wait for you

Soon I left our little home town
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But her words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Savin' all my kisses just for you
Signed with love forever true

I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni, I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

Jimmy Jimmy please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
It's been five years since you've been gone

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

War ganz kurz vor meinem Ziel und hielt mich mächtig ran 
Die Sonne sie stand schon sehr tief als ich zur Ausfahrt kam 
Der Diesel dröhnte neben mir mein Funkgerät war an 
Als daraus die Stimme eines kleinen Jungen kam 
Er sagte nur Kanal 14 ist hier irgendwer? Wenn dann ruf 
Mich doch zurück und sprich mit Teddybär 
Bis zur Stadt war’s nicht mehr weit ich kam ganz gut voran 
Ich nahm das Mikro in die Hand und sagte ganz spontan 
Hey ich rufe Teddybär wo ist der junge Mann? Ich bin auf 
Deiner Welle kannst du mich verstehen? 
Es wurde still auf dem Kanal ich wollt schon weiterdrehen 
Da fragte mich der Junge Fahrer bist du auch noch dran? 
Ich sagte JA und da fing er mir zu erzählen an 
Jeden Tag von früh bis spät schalt ich den Kasten ein 
Sitz im Rollstuhl kann nicht gehen und bin hier ganz allein 
Und meine Mutter arbeitet sie sagt dass muss so sein 
Denn Daddy starb vor einem Jahr auf dieser Autobahn 
Er war ein Fahrer so wie Du bis er dann nicht mehr kam 
Sie sagt mir oft wir schaffen es und tut als wenn nichts wär 
Doch jede Nacht hör ich sie weinen Ich weiß sie hat’s sehr schwer 
Und während er so redete da fiel es mir doch auf 
Kein anderer war zu dieser Zeit auf Kanal 14 drauf 
Er sagte Dieses Funkgerät von Daddy gehört jetzt mir 
Es ist der schönste Zeitvertreib mit einem so wie dir 
Auch Daddy sprach von unterwegs genauso wie jetzt du 
Und eines Tages sagte er mein Junge hör mir zu einmal

Da nehm ich dich mit raus doch leider Wurde nichts mehr raus 
Ich hörte die Enttäuschung die aus diesen Worten Klang 
Ich war längst stehngeblieben das packte mich doch an 
Denn all das ging mir zu Herzen Ich pfiff auf Job und Zeit 
Alle konnten warten nur dieser Junge nicht tut mir leid 
Ich sagte Teddybär wo wohnst du wo liegt deine Station? 
Was ich zu tun hatte dass wusste ich längst schon 
Nur dieser kleine Funker der ahnte nichts davon 
Er gab mir die Adresse sagte lebe wohl und 
Irgendwann vielleicht bist du wieder hier dann wär es schön 
Wenn mich dein Ruf erreicht 
Dann war es Still und ich gab Gas Mit 80 in die Stadt 
Die letzte Kurve ich war da Ich glaubte nicht was ich da sah 
Da standen 18 LKWs Ich war den Tränen nah 
Sie hatten alles mitgehört und fuhrn ihn hin und her 
Ja einer nach dem andren fuhr eine Runde mit Teddybär 
18 mal die Straße runter und 18 mal auch rauf 
Ich war ganz als letzter dran und trug ihn auch wieder hinauf 
Ich hab noch nie ein Kind gesehen dass so restlos glücklich war 
Und seine Augen strahlten es war einfach wunderbar 
Er sagte Fahrer glaube mir dass war eine Schau 
Ich fang dich wieder einmal ein dass weiß ich ganz genau 
Und er hielt meine Hand die ganze Zeit schon 
Ich schluckte und sagte Ist schon gut mein Sohn 
Dann fuhr ich los und mein Gerät dass war noch auf Empfang 
Als auf einmal die Stimme einer Frau erklang Sie sagte 
Und man merkte es das Sprechen fiel ihr schwer 
Hier ist Kanal 14 hier spricht Mutter Teddybär 
Den schönsten Tag in seinem Leben habt ihr meinem Kind gegeben 
Niemals mehr kann ich vergessen wie ihr zu meinem Jungen ward 
Ich danke euch

I look inside myself and see my heart is black 
I see my red door and I must have it painted black 
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts 
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black 

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

Surrounded by four walls

Love and affection
To keep him strong

Livin' just enough
Just enough for the city

His father works some days
For fourteen hours
And you can bet
He barely makes a dollar

His mother goes to scrub
The floors for many
And you'd best believe
She hardly gets a penny

But she is sho'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short
But Lord, her legs are sturdy

To walk, to school
She's got to get up early
Her clothes are old
But never are they dirty

Just enough for the city

He's got more sense than many
His patience's long
But soon he won't have any

Is like a haystack needle

They don't use black people

Snap on you wet boots
And now eat all you mushrooms

An empty feeling, just the same
A silent drive, another show, to a lonely hotel room I’ll go
At times like these I miss you so

But a thousand hands applaud tonight
I sing my songs, my star shines bright
I stop and smile, I take my bow
I leave the stage and then somehow

Backstage, I'm lonely, backstage, I cry
You've gone away and each night I seem to die a little

Out on that stage, I play the star
I'm famous now, I've come so far
A famous fool, I let love go
I didn't know I'd miss you so

Hating myself since I let you say goodbye

Can’t get you out of my mind

Come back my love, come back to me
I need you now so desperately
What good is fame? It's just a game
I'd give it all to be the same

Backstage, I wait now hoping I'll see
Your smiling face waiting there, backstage for me

Some are dead and some are living

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Trying to make the other side
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride

When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old Grandad
Had to sweat to buy you

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
And you bought everything in style

So once you think you're in you're out
'cause you don't mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old Grandad
Had to sweat to buy you

Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And drink a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake them all in a pie

They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest you just throw them all away

""You should write a love poem,
One of those nice 'love is' poems
Because people need their dreams and fantasies""
So I'll tell you what love is
Love is passion and pain 
In the darkness of the night

Screaming spasms of hatred
The line between drawn so close
Standing on the edge, eyes wide awake
Power pounding in your veins
The vision of your face in a shock of light

Love is hard and savage bright
And bleeding knuckles
Where you punched the wall
Agony and jealousy exploding in the dance-hall
The knife blade of tension
Cutting us both ways
It's fighting, fighting, back to back

You and I out-numbered three to one
Laughing and running afterwards
And blood-sweet kisses
Grinding on your broken teeth
Love is my nails in your back 
And grinning in the face
Of a small town's hatred 
Oh, that's what love is, sweetheart

Not pastel pink and wedding white
The same old traps, the half-hearted lies
The cold death
Love is red hot and black hearts
Your whole soul burning
And singing all the while 
Oh yes, that's what love is

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
But is their bounty
What she needs

How can she chance
To love a little bit of earth
Does she not know
The earth is old
And doesn't care if
One small girl wants things to grow

She needs a friend
She needs a father
Brother, sister
Mother's arms
She needs to laugh
She needs to dance
And learn to work
Her girlish charms

She needs a home
The only thing she really needs
I cannot give
Instead she asks
A bit of earth
To make it live

She should have a pony
Gallop 'cross the moor
She should have a doll's house
With a hundred rooms per floor
Why can't she ask for a treasure
Something that money can buy
That won't die
When I'd give her the world
She asks instead
For some earth

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
Their beauty just the thing she needs

She'll grow to love the tender roses
Lilies fair, the iris tall
And then in fall, her bit of earth
Will freeze and kill them all

A bit of earth, a bit of earth,
A bit of earth, a bit of earth

But somehow you seem to move right on in
It didn't look like any man I'd be with
So I decided I'd take you as a friend

After we have started spending some time
I had to stop and look at you one more time
It's been a while since someone has treated me right
I'm so glad that I have you in my life

Never thought that
You would be the one that makes me happy
Loving you has taught me to look
Much deeper than the odds can see, oh baby

You and me come from two different worlds
But that ain't stopping me from being your girl
I'll be with you from now until the end
You never know when life is going your way

You ain't acting like its stupid, come in
Trying to get from me whatever he can
I can't judge you by the cover your in
'Cause I've been missing out on what you're giving

I've come to realize
That I never should have let you go
",Never Should Have Let You Go,1996
Jordan Hill,"Every now and then
We find a special friend
Who never lets us down
Who understands it all
Reaches out each time you fall
You're the best friend that I've found

I know you can't stay
A part of you will never ever go away
Your heart will stay

I'll make a wish for you
And hope it will come true
That life would just be kind
To such a gentle mind
If you lose your way
Think back on yesterday
Remember me this way
Remember me this way

I don't need eyes to see
The love you bring to me
No matter where I go
And I know that you'll be there
Forever more a part of me, you're everywhere
I'll always care

And I'll be right behind your shoulder watching you
I'll be standing by your side and all you do
And I won't ever leave
As long as you believe
You just believe

I'll make a wish for you
And hope it will come true
That life would just be kind
To such a gentle mind

Something that I think you know
Boy you're my kinda flavor
With your kiss, with your touch
You make me feel so much
I wanna return the favor
It's pure rhapsody baby
When you take me up there so high
Don't hold back on me baby
I just wanna ride
This feeling all night long
There's no one else for me
So take me where I want to be
I just wanna ride
This feeling on and on
Until the break of dawn
And all the stars above are gone
Everytime you look at me
Gives me shiver, I can't breathe
What's on your mind baby
There are no secrets here
Just be open I don't care
Let your emotions go crazy
Make a list of your wishes baby
See if I can make 'em all fly
Don't hold back on me baby
I just wanna ride
This feeling all night long
There's no one else for me
So take me where I want to be
I just wanna ride
This feeling on and on
Until the break of dawn

Anyplace, I don't care

Let's sit and talk it over
Express to one another
The things we feel
The things we both need to reveal
Let's start communicating
Before it's much too late
And I do believe
It's time that we speak candidly

I'll forgive you for the pain
If you forgive me just the same
Let's kiss and make-up
Before we slip and break up

We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
Before it slips away

Sometimes I say things that I
Say just to attack your pride
Though I really don't mean it
I call myself try to get even
Lord knows we belong together
We know we need each other
I believe we can win
If we just try to start all over again

If we listen to our hearts
The way we heard it from the start
I know that when we wake up
We'll find it's time to make-up

We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
Before it slips away

If we give up on us
I'm sure that we'll regret it
And if we give up on love
I'm sure in time
We'll come to find
That it's just not worth it
Just not worth it

We can't let it slip away

We can't let it slip away

I'm here to tell you, you've gone too far
So tell me baby who you think you are
I stood here waitin', only to be stood up by you, by you

Don't try my patience, don't lie again
Don't think that I don't know just where you been
Say you been workin' but all I smell on you is perfume

Don't waste your time
With your lines
They don't work on me no more

You got no right
To let me down this way
You got no right
To break my heart again
You got no reason to be leavin'
I ain't gonna ask you to stay
You got no right to treat me this way

You had your chance to keep me by your side
You tried to love me on the slip and slide
Sooner or later your lies are gonna catch up with you, with you

Don't waste your time

One more way to change my mind

I put my heart on the side for a while 
Knowing you're not there 
I tried to carry on 
To face the fact you're gone 
But I need you 
So I close my eyes 

[Chorus]
Close my eyes 
And I dream about you 
I close my eyes 
I can almost feel you in my arms again 

Evenings of passion and cries of joy 
Hold your memory tight 
You've been away so long 
I sing so many songs about you 
I just close my eyes 

[Chorus]

No one really sees you watching over me 
And I hope you feel me watching over you 
And when you go to sleep 
I pray the Lord to keep 
You in my dreams 
When I close my eyes 

[Chorus]",Close My Eyes,1999
Jordan Knight,"I don't know The way that you want this to go 
Baby I'm so sick and tired of playing your games 
If you say the word 
I'll be there soon as it's heard 
Maybe I'm wasting my time working on you 

B-section I'll do my best to show you 
That I'm the one to hold you 
Sometimes you make me lose my mind 

[Chorus] 
We can all go to a different party 
Dancing in the streets with some girls from Maui 
We can all rock at the Déja  Vu 
And you know how we do it 
I just want you to start shaking your body 
Times are gonna change 
Girl you know I'm naughty 
I know you know 
I'll go solo 
With so many lovers so many offers 
To be all over you ain't part of me 

You won't believe 
All of the tricks up my sleeve 
Baby you so hypnotize me with your eyes 
I can't control 

Long enough to let you know 
I'm getting old 
Wasting my time waiting on you Change 

[Chorus]",A Different Party,1999
Jordan Knight,"I feel like the world is on my head 
I don't want to lose what made me a man 
Still when I call your name 
I wait, you'll say, you're so far away 

Now that I feel the well so dry 
I need you to fill me up inside 
Baby you turn me on and on 

Just want to hold you 
I'm dying to show you 
Don't run from me 
Don't turn your back on me

Don't say that it's over 
Don't run from me 
Don't turn your back on me 
Come out of the dark 
Don't tear us apart 
don't run from my heart

What all along I held in my hands 
If you give me one more chance 
I'll prove, I'm true to you 

Now every night it seems so wrong 
I'm here all alone where you belong 
Girl let me turn you on and on 

I'm such a dreamer 
When I'm sleeping, I'm thinking of you

Only last June when her old man ran away

Verse 2 

It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes 

He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die 

He left her with a baby and another one on the way 

She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay

Maybe you don't know

how you live in my dreams, my dreams

something about your smile

starts the butterflies inside me

maybe you don't see

the two of us like I do, I do

but no one wants you more,

than this dreamer standing right beside you


Whatever it takes

I'm taking it all the way

now it's all or nothing

never gonna find me a better day

never gonna love any other way

baby my heart's saying now

hoping that I waited for the right time

praying for the words that'll make you mine

baby I'm shaking

but my heart's saying now


When I think of you

my heart takes a tumble, tumble

if I could have one wish

the walls around your heart would crumble

I've waited for so long

until the perfect moment came along

don't let me be invisible

tell me girl

is it me you really want?


Whatever it takes

I'm taking it all the way

now it's all or nothing

I need to know, you drive me crazy

all night, I think about you

now I'm telling you, telling you the way that I feel

'cause I know it's for real.

now it's all or nothing

Hit ya in the spot..baby leavin you sleepless 
I can't believe this..The block is heated.. 
Dance for me mommy, baby, papi he needs it 
The top I peeped it..the bra release it.. 
Shake it for me mommy, you the bomb believe it.. 
The Don I keeped it, 
The Cris we popped it 
Work it on the dance floor, mommy don't stop it.. 
The drop I copped it..my motto is shop it 
Roll with me mommy, pick it up, and drop it 


So we can get it on..if we can break it down.. 
If we can get it right.. we can get it on tonight 
If we can get it on..if we can break it down..

Jordan Knight,"Yeah, yeah

Sitting here waiting for tomorrow
All because of yesterday
I wish I had all the answers
For all the things you had to say

I wanna come and change your mind girl
No more lies and no more games

I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?

And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?
Your heart tonight?

Feeling a little loneliness and sorrow
I only have myself to blame
Had a good girl and I lost her
I start to cry and feel ashamed

I wanna come and change your mind girl
No more lies and no more games

I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?

And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?

I'll never understand what ever happened to us
What ever happened to us
Our love was like summer the sun always shining above
Ooh yeah, then all the rain came crashing down
And I can't turn this thing around without you

I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?

And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?

",Where Is Your Heart Tonight,2005
Jordan Knight,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time will never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

Could have been so good together
We could have make this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Take a breath, no it's not too late

Set me on fire, but don't forget to breathe in

What happened to the ceiling now?

Too many lights
I don't know what I'm seeing
Where is my mind?
Don't know what to believe in
Too many highs
What happened to the ceiling now?

High as can be
Like hibiscus tea
Forward in food so I sit down and eat
Give me the loot
Feeling the beat
well, too many hits and I can't feel my feet
I'm in the booth, floating offbeat
I am the truth, you're novelty

Like fortune tellers don't need umbrellas
I know this bank, I don't embellish
Like broke motherfuckers don't need Margielas
I don't need shit, I know y'all jealous
Take it too far
Fuck around lose it, watch it fall apart
Dip me in Dopamine, girl let me sink to the floor
Can't even watch
Money can change who you are
Money can make a man talk
Camping with the star
Can't even reason

Ice in my veins

'Cause I ain't got no time and I'm trying to smoke
Up, up, up man, out of my way
'Cause you blocking my sun, yeah, tossin' my shade

People rather have separation than to come together living freely

Make it difficult to grow a glee tree when the love level back in B.C
We will never see racism done away within our lifetime
When the parents hearts filled of hate, reproduce, then it's sending down the pipeline
If their kids want to fight crime, and they talk to others of the right kind
That'd be terrifying facing nighttime and it's still the only light shined
Jesus not present when things seem so egregious
But if we just set aside all our differences and try to ease up
Off of war with each other please trust we can be just
When the hating, killings', enough and the anthem will have everybody taking knees up

We said ""Turn this message louder 'till the speakers bleed""

'Cause they don't want consumers to stop their pay streams
If they don't agree with your way of thinking they taking
Your cake cream, no love no life is all that hate brings
I stand by love so if this don't enhance my buzz
And the fans die and my blood, the world is ran by thugs
That just want to bend my blood that runs with an angel flow
What they bleed ought to be equality, never been the angle though
But one day soon I want to see the people loving then say ""Bravo""

Wishing we could be rid of all terrorism
Like it's theorism, for the good I'd say heroism
We are the dauntless and miss the demons we see in swarms
So mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed
I learned to love from my mother
I feel an angel around me, I know she hovers
Impatiently waiting for you to discover that people all need each other
When you see me, I'll call you brother
Never mattered whatever color
