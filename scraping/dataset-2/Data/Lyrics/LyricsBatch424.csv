Jefferson Airplane,"When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies
Don't you want somebody to love, don't you...
Need somebody to love, wouldn't you...

Love somebody to love, you better...
Find somebody to love
When the garden flowers baby are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of bread

Don't you want somebody to love, don't you...
Need somebody to love, wouldn't you...
Love somebody to love, you better...
Find somebody to love

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah, but in your head, baby, I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Don't you want somebody to love, don't you...
Need somebody to love, wouldn't you...

Love somebody to love, you better...
Find somebody to love
Tears are running down and down and down your breast
And your friends, baby   they treat you like a guest

Don't you want somebody to love, don't you...
Need somebody to love, wouldn't you...
Love somebody to love, you better...
Find somebody to love",Somebody to Love [Live],2004
Jefferson Airplane,"If you were a bird and you lived very high
You'd lean on the wind when the breeze came by
You'd say to the wind as it took you away
That's where I wanted to go today
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do, I do know that I need to have you around
Love like a mountain springtime
Flashing through the rivers of my mind

It's what I feel for you
You and me go walking south
And we see all the world around us
The colors blind my eyes and my mind to all but you
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do, I do know that I need to have you around
Around

I have a house where I can go
When there's too many people around me
I can sit and watch all the people
Down below goin' by me
Halfway down the stairs is a stair
Where I sit and think about you and me
I sit and think about you and me

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky when I die
When I die, when I'm high, when I die, when I die?
If you were a cloud and you sailed up there
You'd sail on water as blue as air
You'd see me here in the fields and say
Doesn't the sky look green today?

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky when I die
When I die, when I die
When I'm high, when I die, die, die, die, die?",The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil,2005
Jefferson Airplane,"The summer had inhaled and held its breath too long
The winter looked the same, as if it never had gone
And through an open window where no curtain hung
I saw you
I saw you 
Comin' back to me

One begins to read between the pages of a book
The shape of sleepy music, and suddenly you're hooked
Through the rain upon the trees, the kisses on the run
I saw you 
I saw you 
Comin' back to me

You came to stay and live my way
Scatter my love like leaves in the wind
You always say you won't go away
But I know what it always has been
It always has been

A transparent dream beneath an occasional sigh
Most of the time I just let it go by
Now I wish it hadn't begun
I saw you, yes, I saw you 
Comin' back to me

Strolling the hills overlooking the shore
I realized I've been there before
The shadow in the mist could have been anyone
I saw you
I saw you 
Comin' back to me

Small things like reasons are put in a jar
Whatever happened to wishes wished upon a star?
Was it just something that I made up for fun?
I saw you, I saw you comin' back to me",Comin' Back to Me,2005
Jefferson Airplane,"Baby mine
Feel so good
All the time
If you would

The girl knows how to love
Both night and day
She know how to feel so fine
All over in every way

Ain't no lie
If you go
I won't die
Sure won't grow

Sit 'round running numbers
Sit 'round with my friends
Wasting time now, watching the sky
Waiting for the story to end

Until she set me free
With her motion
Roll me 'round
Like the ocean

I can't wait to get some more
Of what the girl's got to give
Living without her's like loving a wall
And that ain't no way to live.",Feel So Good [Live],2005
Jefferson Airplane,"I didn't know you were the one for me, I couldn't see
But you were waiting
For someone to come along to help you out
To sing your song
And I was changing
All I see is you, all I feel is you

For me
And I would really like to watch you ride
And always feel you by my side
I would really like to watch you ride
All on me

I go stumbling to the sky, and I seem to fly so high
I see you, I feel you
You have a way of walking 'round
Your feet they never touch the ground
And you are shining
All I see is you

All I feel is you for me
Oh
Times don't change
Times don't ever change for me
And I know that you could be
The only thing in my world
The only thing that my mind would find
For love, for love and peace of mind
For me, yeah, for me, oh

Your shadow in the morning sun becomes my fun
And we can say, I love you, love you
My morning shines on silver beaches
And your flashes to the reaches
Of my mind, of my mind
Of my mind, and my mind it comes alive with you
It's all that I can do
To sit here and let you blow my mind
Ah, my mind

You're so fine, in my mind you're so fine
In my mind you're so fine, in my mind, so fine, so fine",Watch Her Ride,2005
Jefferson Airplane,"Owsley and Charlie, twins of the trade
Come to the Poet's Room
Talking about the problems of the leaf
And yes, it'll be back soon

There used to be tons of gold and green
Comin' up here from Mexico
A donde esta la planta, mi amigo, del sol?

But Mexico is under the thumb
Of a man we call Richard
And he's come to call himself king
But he's a small-headed man
And he doesn't know a thing
About how to deal for you

How to deal for you
There are millions of you now
I mean it's not as if you were alone
There are brothers everywhere
Just waiting for a toke on that gold
And God knows how far it can go

But thanks Uncle Charlie
For your Mexican smoke
You're a legend Owsley
For your righteous dope

There were a half a million people on the lawn
And we sang to the faces in the dawn
How long must that damn race
Wait for the jailer's time to end?
How long must the Panther race
Wait for the iron bars to bend?
No no no no no nobody waits",Mexico (Bonus Track),2006

Have you seen the saucers? 
Do you know the people out there 
Who aren't happy with the way that we care 
For the Earth Mother. 
Have you seen the saucers. 
Tranquility Base 
There goes the neighborhood 
American garbage dumped in space and no room left for brotherhood 
Have you seen our saucers? 
See our lights in your western skies, California? 
The rainbow skies 
The government tells you another missile is flying 
Have you any idea why they're lying to you? 
To your faces 
Did they tell you? 
Have you seen our saucers? 

Your mother needs you, now she's getting old 
Her face was pretty, but you let her go 
Have you seen our saucers?

Jefferson Starship,"Everything, everything has come to life again 
I have no doubts but the ice got thin 
What came too soon was so hard to keep 
So full a harvest it was hard to reap 

There were times seemed just like the walls would crumble 
Shoot from the hip and pray for trouble 
Stone-cold sober and a-seeing double 
How that midnight band could ramble 
Taking mansions and leaving shambles 

Remember other times and places 
Last night's dance, the glowing faces 
All the lights, the shadows in the hall 
Seeking higher peaks from which to fall 

Remember, we were telling you 
That time would stop and nations fall 
Now we find the lies come true 
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me 
What are we to do? 

Because the good old days 
Those good old days are all dead and gone 
Good-bye and bless them all, every one 
What was true has passed the test 
Just as well forget the rest 
Half of what you saw was not yours to know 
Let it go. 

Everything has come to life again",Come to Life,1974
Jefferson Starship,"Think of the times you have sat by yourself 
And wondered 
Just what it was that compelled you to be 
What you are 
You came into this life unsheltered and all alone 
That's how you came and for sure that's how you go out. 

High on a hill you can feel the breeze 
And rest easy 
All things that live have a right to exist 
And be free. 

You came into this life unsheltered and all alone 
That's how you came and for sure that's how you'll go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out 
That's for sure, that's how you go out. 

Is there a chance you have taken these steps 
So not losing 
Losing all that you have, don't you know what you have is not 
Real 
You came into this life unsheltered and all alone 
That's how you came and for sure that's how you go out

Are ungathered blackberries in my head

Warm as a piece of the sun and 
Darker than night to a blind man 
Softer than starlight shinin'.

Ain't nothing else to be prouder of 
I need you bad, baby, you're the best thing I ever had 
If you can do it, you can get it

Gotta get me some/ gotta get me some

I can't dance you outta my mind 
I hear shoutin' in my heart 
When you're in these arms of mine 
When you satisfy my days and nights 
Gratify my appetites

Wide eyed with wonder
Thought they were falling stars
And you could wish
That dreams would someday
Someday would come true
When I'd slay dragons
And win the hand of the
Fairest maiden
Keep on dreamin'
Of the way it could be
In a fairy tale land
With a magic lady
Keep believin'
In the way it could be
In a make-believe world
With your fantasy
In a magic kind of love

Now that I'm older
Still lookin' for that bed of roses
That bowl of cherries
I can bury my face in
I can almost taste it
Maybe I'm make-believin'
But if I'm dreamin'
Baby please please don't wake
Me now
(Repeat chorus)
A magic kind of love
A magic kind of love
Now that I finally found love
I don't need no magic potion baby
'Cause when we're together
We are the magic kind of
The magic kind
In your fantasy in a magic kind
Of love

Nothing's forever

Brought me back to my senses

Under false pretenses

No way out

Thought it was clever
She didn't ask
And I got no reply
But later that night
I heard her cry

No way out she doesn't buy my story
No way out she doesn't buy my story

No accusations

Since yesterday

It won't happen again

Where were you when the passion was new

Stand a little closer to the fire

Writing in the book of people

My guitar it will not sleep

Remembering all the people.....the warriors

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

Jeffrey Foucault,"Just about a year ago, I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune, lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you will know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound, I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through, must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar, for every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play while people sat there drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

A teardrop forms in my eye
When I look into the face of a child
The teardrop falls from my eye
And if there weren't so many
Unwanted children in the world today
Then maybe I could understand your view
But as long as there's so many
Children without a happy home
Then leave my choices alone
If I don't want this life
Then why should you
A life without love is something
An innocent child shouldn't be put through
When I look into the midnight sky
And see the sins of those we respect
And when I look into the face of a child
I see the pain from their neglect
There are those who call it murder
And say that it is a sin
But I still can't understand your view
Please respect that it's

And leave my choices alone

Seems I've forgotten
All that I was told
And the heartache is starting
Cause those who love themselves
Aren't enslaved to no one else
And they don't have to compromise
And they don't have to cover their eyes

And I've rendered myself powerless

He's got disease but he bears it for love

So many of us just slaves for love

And I'm in there somewhere
Cause love ain't got no rules
But somehow I still care
For those who love themselves
Even more than I love myself
And though you bring me pain and sorrow
I'll still be here tomorrow

He's got his pride, he's not exempt from humiliation
Can't lift a finger to stop what's wrong
He can't lift a leg to dance to a Beatles' song
While so many people taken spines for granted
Slither and squirm, taken what they're handed
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many people go day by day
Sitting on their hands constantly complaining
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many content to exist like sheep
Never scratching the surface
Of themselves too deep
I know a man who'd know what to do
So many people like you and me
Never realizing what our lives could be

Jeffrey Gaines,"You don't like me for my future
You don't like me for my past

It's that you always will be there
And I realize it's a new feeling
Never have I been so free
Cause I like you, the things you do
And I know that you like me

It's the time I spend with you

Jeffrey Gaines,"Feeling sometimes she's been led astray
No one left who she can trust
Not sure what to do
Not sure what to say
She's got so much unresolved stuff
Every now and then you see her smile
There you can begin to see a child
Who's been told that she's just not good enough
All this time it's been like hell
But she's just not giving up
She makes friends easily
Watch her lay her body down
In the end she'll be fine
If she realizes
It's only in her mind
Needing so badly
Never quite fulfilled
She says she can't deal with the truth
She says it's the shame her father instilled
Watch her cry the tears
She had to hide in her youth
Every now and then you see her smile
There you can begin to see a child

All this time it's been like hell

Watch her give herself for free
But in the end she'll be fine

It will probably torment her everyday

Had one thing in my life that I could understand
But then I tried to have it all

Looking for just one thing
Now without a sound
Face to face in the crowd
I can't feel one thing
I used to be assured
Never in my life was I to be ignored
But I let it go to my head

Clearing all the tearing from my eyes
I'm too lost to find a friend
I hold my heart before you

I walked above the clouds I could never sink

Or should I say when did it end

We both lost a friend
But to go on and on
Hand in hand down the path
Of a future that's paved in the past
That was another place
Place and time
And we both realize we're to young for the lies
That we told each other year after year
Which read like a nursery rhyme
I know we'll get by
We'll do what we must to survive
I'll find a small town girl
You'll find that artist inside

I also know it's time to go
And there'll be nights when I'm missing you
And there'll be nights I'll hurt inside

While there's people dying to be free
And you're smiling from your private place

But what of your innocence brigade
Are you really that pure
Or do you fight to ignore what's around

And are you for real
Sweet Janine where have you been
And what do you feel?
You're bathing in the sweet sunshine
While there's people crying in the frost
And the only concern on your mind
Is to have a good time whatever the cost
Don't want to throw you a curve
I wouldn't want your bubble to break
But what have you done to truly deserve
The keys to my town
What ain't nailed down you'll take
Sweet Janine what have you seen
And are you for real
Sweet Janine what have you seen, and
What do you think about the homeless millions
What do you think about dying civilians
What do you think about the freedom fighters
What do you think about letter bomb writers
Well you're skating on a figure of eight
While there's pain and there's hate at your feet
And your Daddy's made clear
That there's nothing to fear
At least here on your street
I don't want to darken your door
I wouldn't want you shedding a tear dear
But you've got everything and still you want more
You could learn a little sharing
And just a tad of caring I fear

I never thought it would grow
It must have climbed aboard while I was sleeping
You know
Now I don't feel the same

And all this time I thought I had it under control
Now I can't resist the temptation
And it calls to me each and every hour
And I'm faced with the failure of me
And I just ain't got the power
To make it go away
Wish I could wish it away
I was so blind to think
This never could happen to me
And I didn't really notice
Cause it happened so gradually
Now I know that I've been telling me lies
It's getting harder and harder to disguise
I've gone and become the man I said I'd never be
Now I know I must change
But where should I start
There's so much work that has to be done
I've been bitter and mean
Got a low self esteem
And I'm reaching out to anyone
To make it go away
Wish I could wish it away
Wish I could make it go away
Wish I could wish it way

To turn my condition around
Exchange the bad for the good
And be stepping on bright new ground

The only thing that we all had in common was you
And now you've moved on
And there isn't anything we can do
But it wasn't long ago
We were all gathered 'round
This house was a home
Happiness was found
Now we must find a new safety in self
And implement all that we've learned
Now is the time to find our own wealth
And stand on our own
So much we have grown
From knowing you
I know this loss was intended
To let us all begin
And to give up now would be a sin
We can't fall down
We've got to keep marching
But it wasn't long ago
We were all at ease
Headed for home
Thought we had beat this disease
And it wasn't long ago
That we lived with the prayer
That in the safety of home
You would always be there
Now we must find a new safety in self
And all that you taught is returned
Now is the time to find our own wealth
And finish what's begun before our days are done
We must be true
Now we must find a new safety in self

How much more can her heart take
How many nights sitting by the phone
How much longer will she be alone

I see the doorway to a thousand churches
In your eyes
The resolution of all the fruitless searches

I see the light and the heat

I want to touch the light

So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away

I hear you calling for me

[Kelly]
Sometimes I cry in my sleep
Although I understand why
I can't be with you tonight, oh

So I'll just close my eyes
I'll try to sleep for awhile, hmm
I hold my pillow real tight, baby, baby
Cause soon I'll be by your side

Bridge II:
Backgrounds
Cause I love you
I'm gonna try not to worry
Really miss you
I'm coming home in a hurry
Coming home soon
But I just wanted to tell you
Gonna hold you
How much I really do miss you

So baby close your eyes
And try to sleep for awhile
You'll hold your pillow tonight
But soon I'll be by your side

So baby close your eyes
And try to sleep for awhile
You'll hold your pillow tonight
But soon I'll be by your side",The Lullaby,2000
Jeffrey Lee Pierce,"I may be
just like Bill
I'm up on the hill
and I can't get down

I cry because you don't know
I cry because you will never know

just how dark can an animal be?
how dark can an animal be?

Dark like darkness
dark like a devil out in the woods now

I saw the light
that just buzzed
I saw the light
but, my brain just buzzed

I cry because you never know
I cry because you will never know

just how black can an animal be?

Jeffrey Lee Pierce,"Look what's been done, John
It's coming out of the east like rain, Johnny
Look what's been done, John
It's coming like a God with no name, Johnny

And I'm out near Santa Fe
Hitching out for the warmer days
I'm all broke up, Johnny
It all just beat me down, beat me down

Look down the line, Johnny
There's flashlights on the back-roads, Johnny
Look down the line, Johnny
Of the American unknown, Johnny

And I'm out here in the desert
All your dreams lie dead in the desert
I'm all torn up, Johnny
It all just beat me down, beat me down

Look at that girl, Johnny
Yellow hair a shine, Indian eyes to see, Johnny
Look at her, Johnny
Her love is like anything to me, Johnny

What slipped so deep into me?
I can never get it out of me
I'm all broke up, Johnny
It all just tore me down

",Goodbye Johnny,1997
Jeffrey Lee Pierce,"Promise me
Outside in the trees
They're waiting tonight

Promise me
While the searching light
Moon has found me

Know it feels like
The last time again

Promise me
Someone who will promise me
Stand in the dark and fight like me

Through eyes like fireflies
Turn around and tell me
It'll be alright
Is it alright?

Promise me
Don't cheat my soul
When it returns to me

Promise me
Give me the vision
I was born to see

You know it feels like years since
They burned me away
You know feels like years since
Turned my heart away

Yeah, it feels like years
Feels like years
Feels like years since
Took my eyes away

Jeffrey Lewis,"Life is a story don't you doubt
Bad times give you something to talk about
The next time you feel you're all worn out 
Remember life is a story
Don't you doubt
It only takes a day for everything to turn around

Love is a story they tell to you
But the way they tell it ain't quite true
You'll wake up one day and you're twenty-two
You know love is just a story that they tell to you
Love takes a lot of work like everything else you're gonna do

Friends are just the people that you can talk with
Somebody to talk about that somebody to talk about this
But everyone changes and forever is a myth
Friends are just the people that you can talk with
A lot of them'll leave but only a few you're gonna miss

School is the place where I did my growing
They fill your brain to overflowing
They tell you this is all stuff you need to be knowing
School is the place where I did my growing
Just when I got to like it it was time to be going

The world is the place where it all happens
They draw lines on it and call it a map
In between every line's a different flag flapping
The world is the place where it all happens
Six billion people all taking turns eating in a napkin

Animals are critters just like you and me
The only difference is that they don't worry
About things that they can't smell or see
Animals are critters just like you and me
So we buy pants and deodorants and claim not to be

Songs are just something to waste your time
I listen to yours and you listen to mine
Before we know it the day's gone by
Songs are just something to waste your time
So is everything else to do whatever makes you feel fine

God's just a story someone made up long ago
Before they had books and TV shows
I don't believe in him and I ain't afraid to say so
You know god's just a story someone made up long ago
But it's hard not to be superstitious despite all you know

Everyone's born and everyone dies
Everyone has a time and wonders why
The ocean's blue so is the sky
Everyone's born and everyone dies
The old lady cries, the new baby cries and sighs

Kisses are weird but they can be fun
Instead of shaking hands it's like shaking tongues
I wish I got to do it more when I was young
Kisses are weird but they can be fun
I hate going once a month without kissing anyone

At this point it's been since uh how many months
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
I think if kissing someone could make them pregnant 
The last person I kissed would have had their kid by now

Dreams are weird but they can be fun too
They happen more often than kisses it's true
In some I was naked and in some I flew
Dreams are weird but they can be fun too
I wonder if you're dreaming about me when I'm dreaming about you

Now that you heard everything I said
There ain't nothing new inside your head
If you want, disregard it all go ahead
Now that you've heard everything I said
There are probably one or two things you coulda been doing instead

Life is a story don't you doubt
Bad times give you something to talk about
The next time you feel you're all worn out

Don't you doubt

Jeffrey Lewis,"Late at night cloudy light will creep over my old house
And the chair, where I once sat, someone new is there, 
And he'll stare at that wall, and we're all
Parts of an alphabet
Spell new words in new spots we're at

And the big blue boat drifts around in the dark
When you feel like a jerk does it make you confused?
Like how could you become as awesome as you are and still feel like a loser?
When you feel ugly and petty
All quirked and unsteady
Just try not to forget there's so many people who've liked you
I hope that the art school enjoys your big drawing  of ruins
We've all got good things to do and it's good when we do them

From Austin to Brooklyn
They're all smart and good lookin'

Fallen from grace

Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

But mine is the way of the Lord

Shall have their reward

You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season, returns and returns
And is always the same

You fall in flame

On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

And stars in your multitudes

That I may see him
Safe behind wrong
I will never rest
And just to share
It's pleasures and belong

Each day, till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars

You are the light of the world!
But if that light is under a bushel
Brrr, it's lost something kind of crucial

You got to stay bright to be the light of the world
You are the salt of the earth, you are the salt of the earth
But if that salt has lost it's flavor, it ain't got much in its favor
You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth!

So let your light so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine
(Let's have some wine!)

You are the city of God
You are the city of God
But if that city's on a hill, it's kinda hard to hide it well
You've got to stay pretty in the city of God

You are the light of the world, you are the light of the world
But the tallest candlestick
Ain't much good without a wick
You've got to stay bright to be the light of the world

You've got to live right to be the light of the world

And I know that it's wrong but I'm safe when I'm strong
Keeping feelings locked in this sheltered heart of mine
Said, ""I'll never give in"", then I see you again

And with one touch I'm all caught up
In the midst of a dangerous dance
In your arms, I got nowhere to run
I don't stand a chance

When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
And a flame starts to rise igniting what used to be
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
Happens every time you're near, emotional

I remember the last time I let you in
I was burned by the flame, I can still feel the pain
And it scares me, it scares me to know I can still feel the same
As I felt the last time, I chose hearts over mind

All those memories rushing back to me
And I'm trembling with every embrace
Trying to hide those old feelings
That I thought time had erased

When I look in your eyes I get so emotional
And a flame starts to rise igniting what used to be
In the heat of the night I get so emotional
It happens every time you're near, emotional

I know there's no escaping what I'm feeling inside
So just hold me tonight 'cause baby
This feeling's just too strong to fight

Working overtime in a foreign land

We shared some time over Beaujolais
Within a short span of time
We fell in love

A new disguise to fool any man

Visiting for tea
You and her and I
And lady Di

The queen said, ""I'm aghast""
Love never seem to last
However hard you try
And Di replied

That there are no more lovers left alive
No one has survived
So there are no more lovers left alive
And that's why my love has died

Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened
To me and you

The carriages arrived
We stood and said goodbye
Diana dried her eyes
And looked surprised

For I was in the nude
The old queen disapproved
But people laughed and asked
For autographs

That there are no more lovers left alive
No one has survived
So there are no more lovers left alive
And that's why my love has died

I spend too much time at work
I've gotta stay that extra hour
I've gotta make that extra dollar
If you want to be the best you've gotta work
I know that I have everything
But it's not enough for me
I know I have everything
But I want more
Some day I'll be the richest man
Being lazy I can't stand
I don't have fun and I don't live
I love to take but I don't give

Jeffries Fan Club,"I gave you everything I've got
I know it's not a lot but I tried so hard
All the time we spent wonder where it went
Why must time move on
Why must we grow apart
Where did we go wrong
You've been gone for so long and I don't know how to move on
Where did we go wrong
You've been gone for so long and I don't know how to move on
I don't know how to move on
I remember yesterday all the good times fade away
Well I don't know where you are but I want you back
You left when times got hard
I'll let you know you broke my heart
But I'd love to have you back
Every night I dream that you come back
I wake up with a smile on my face
But I know you don't care
You are never coming back
I can't move on...

Jeffry Denman,"When the war was over, why, there were jobs galore
For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand
And it's not so hard to understand

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?
Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""

They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name
Nobody thinks of assigning him
When they stop wining and dining him
It seems this country never has enjoyed

Man since I been off in this music business shit has gotten crazy 
I gotta be dealing wit devils bitches and bustas daily
All ah dem was screamin to take me on that long ride
Journey or mission, whatever you want to call it
they tryin to get me Listen,
I'm hearing voices sayin Kill dem muthaphukkaz dead
Other voices saying be humble man and understand
I try to be level headed but it seems the devils winnin
try to do the right thing but I always end up sinnin
Pin Me
God won't forgive you when you pray and do the same shit
So I repent, and you can't even pay yo rent
If it ain't no dollars ain't no sense right now
But as I stop and think, a nigga got kids right now
And mine got ta eat
But they can't eat if daddy's dead or in jail
So, what would you do choose heaven or hell
If it's hell, you'd probly come up fast, and die
That's why {and i} I wonder why heaven 
ain't the chance on my mind

And the niggaz that used to run wit cha

But nah, you muthaphukkaz tryin ta go to heaven
Be broke and ain't nobody bless you

Hunger was gnawing my soul
But the preacher man's sermon
Won't put no food in my bowl

Abidjan to Monrovia
Looking for food and a home
Instead I found factions and armies
In the middle of a combat zone

I want love, I need love
I want love
I want love, I need love,
And a little food in my bowl

Here in this tribal warfare
For food you need money or a gun
I signed up - whose side I don't care
At least now I'm someone

At parade time the grown-ups are cruel
And all of the soldiers are small
Commanders and captains and colonels
All kids with their backs to the wall

I want love, I need love
I want love
I want love, I need love,
And a little food in my bowl

They told me I'm joining a family
But here I ain't nobody's son
My brothers are right here beside me
We share our hunger and we share our gun

Tomorrow we start the offensive
Been drinking palm wine all day
Grigrimen can keep us from bullets
But hash won't keep hunger at bay

I want love, I need love
I want love
I want love, I need love,
And a little food in my bowl

When it's time the small soldiers march forward
When one falls the next takes his gun
Four to one AK47

With just one single golden thread
I could have woven dreams

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

No worries
No worries
Uh, check, I don't ever, I don't ever
Check
No worries

I don't ever worry 'bout my next step
Or ever even worry 'bout my next check
Like it's the best bet, trying to protect neg
Living in this hurry, only worry is my next breath
'Cause you can get left and ghost with the rest
And end up most raise a toast to the death
Like it's blessed
But the second guess pokes through your chest
'Til you rest where your breddas left wishing you were next
But the best don't, fade
Flicker where the flame blows
The circle still be tighter than some canerows
I feel the pain, never worry if the pain shows
Maybe only reason I be feeling like I paint those images that fit
Quick like the minute that you flip
For your finish feel the ignorance and dip
Still you slip
For a minute blame the Guinness that you sip
Little pierce missing ignorance and bliss

No drama, nah, nada
You falling out your tree, tryna be the top banana
Even the apple of my eye turn green with envy
When every jungle animal is on a feeding frenzy
Fear loathing on this helter skelter
When all we really need is food, clothing and shelter
Played the hand they dealt ya down 'til the last card
You claim king but only jokers have the last laugh
So when alarm bells ring we don't do a thing
But sing, it's sink or swim and the tide is in
Every night is a title bid
You gotta float when you're the butterfly that they're tryna pimp
And pack a sting for those buzzing 'round your honeybee
But never sweating when it's coming to the currency
The money been the root of evil since Genesis
So I let the ink chase the paper when I'm penning this

So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry

I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry, nah
No worries

Nah we ain't in a hurry
We ain't in a rush bBut we steady pacing
Chasing payments is a blatant but we're staying patient
Pumping product from this basement trying to make a statement
But ain't nothing changed when I check my statement
Remain determined 'cause the work is being put in
I'm aware of what I'm cooking and the people overlooking
Mastering this recipe before we hand it out
But still living hand-to-mouth
Thought I had it figured out ,what a setback
That time is money that I'll never get back
And yeah I get that but listen if that
No time to dwell, 'cause only time will tell if it works
Flipping verses, filling purses is a gift and a curse
And so I, live for the better and I learn from the worst
I'm burning earnings will curve
And it's discerning at first
Determine money for music is the plan I prefer
To tell my mother I'm a man of my word
It's no worries

No worries
So don't worry

But we ain't in a hurry, nah

Ah, we just made some money for our family
Plan A worked out we didn't need no plan B
Brothers upset saying they can't stand me
Talk about the money that they hand me

Que algún día yo te dí no ha llenado tu interior
Y por eso que te vas alejándote de mi
Y sin mirar hacia atrás, hacia atrás

Que no nos quedaba ya

Y que nunca mas volvió oh no

Eu não 

Eu não 'tô podendo ficar
Nem mais um minuto sem te ver
Eu não pude acreditar
Quando você foi sem me dizer

Vi a alegria voltar
Quando recebi um telegrama
Você dizendo pra te esperar
Que não demora e que ainda me ama
Dizendo que me ama",Sobrenatural (Cadê Você),1988
Jeito Moleque,"Voz de criança, pista de dança
Cabelo solto, eu não te solto
Desce do salto e vem me beijar
Vejo esse sol todo em seu olhar
Brilha tão devagar

Saia pequena, moça que pena
Tu me ignora, eu te adoro
Eu te devoro só desde já
Vê se já vamos lá! Vou ficar
Onde vou te esperar

No céu, na mão, no chão
Nas nuvens, nas nuvens
Onde vou te esperar

Moça bonita, pescoço alto
Aveludado, olhar de fada
Você é foda e vai me levar
Num papo de só querer dançar
E eu vou te acompanhar

Casa vazia, nascer do dia
Teu sol se esconde
Um sol gigante
Distante brilha no seu lugar
Me diz agora onde vou ficar
Onde vou te esperar

No céu, na mão, no chão
Nas nuvens, nas nuvens
Onde vou te esperar",Nas Nuvens,2007

Jel,"I'm your neighborhood spaceman.
You don't know who I am,
or where I've been.

Circling like a satellite.
Sigh post in the sky,
look at me.

Religious ???????????(no clue)
The world is shaking me,
so the same(?).

So now I'm gonna sing,
I'm comin' home.
You hear my song through the galaxy.

Time's light has reached your eyes.
World has lived and died, but we're here.

Time and space are landing right where we're standing.
Open up your hand and something good will happen.
Drinking on the sun,
we found a whole new planet.
Stars align a thousand times that old black magic.

When no one is looking,
ain't gonna shut my mouth and I'm crying out.
When no one is looking,
I'm on the balcony singing the serenade.
When no one is looking,
I swallow thunder clouds, I kiss the hollowed ground.
When no one is looking,
I eat the desert sand and drink the Rio Grande.
When no one is looking,.
I'm crying raindrops and chewing mountain tops.
When no one is looking,
I break another rhyme and I'm stopping time.

I'm your neighborhood spaceman,
and your breath is moving through me.
On the surface of this moon I can say to you, ""It's okay.""
Somebody inside of us makes this joy a must(?),
then we'll be knee deep in ecstasy no gravity to hold us down again.
Were Free!
A thousand light years from this place,
I see the look on your face and I'm there.

Time and space are landing right where we're standing.
Open up your hand and something good will happen.
Drinking on the sun,
we found a whole new planet.
Stars align a thousand times that old black magic.

When no one is looking,
I'm gonna buckle down, I'm gonna hit the ground.
When no one is looking,
I got to understand, I'm packin' up again.
When no one is looking,
I'll pull the car around cause I'm leaving town.
When no one is looking,
I'm just a rocket man , I've seen the Vatican(?).
I'll never give up,
I'll never let you down, I'll bring you the crown.
I'll never give up,
but On the Other hand I wanna be the man.
I'll never give up,
I'll never let you down, I'll bring you the crown.
I'm courageous enough,
but on the other hand I'm out of here, my friend",Your Neighborhood Spaceman,2006

And lick your initials in my neck
Foreplay does nothing for me
But commitment makes me wet

I already know you're having an affair with words
But boo, I'm married to it
My vocabulary leaves most men wary
I need to know, can you get into it?

This is so torturous

But I can not resist
Just what is it that you are weaving
That's keeping my body from leaving?

Your presence is lingering
Longer than I thought it would and I
Feel that I should succumb to your magic
'Cause I know you're just as

Bright as a shinin' star
I remember the fragrance
I just couldn't believe I'd come so far for

Love in the fast lane
As my sanity quickly passed me by
Yeah, I left it all behind

Battling, battling, these feelings are traveling
Quicker than a flick of lightning, you were tightening
Round my heart and won't slow down
Burning hotter than the world underground

I'm feeling like Cupid's fool, what to do?
And the arrow's headed straight for you, you
I don't wanna love another, gotta keep this undercover

And tie you up with similes?
Give you pain and pleasure with soliloquies
Until you beg me for release

Jelena Gavrilovic,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014

What be it a man to gain the world and lose his soul

Now I got it & don't want the shit no more
Never had a girlfriend when I was living poor
So who the hell are these women knocking at my door

I'm through with these so called friends of mine
Cause no one was around when I was doing time
No one ever called or send a dime
None of these fakes drop me a line

Snow will survive this fucked-up game
I'll live to see my enemies bow in shame

Cause that's my life

First I got the money 
Then I get the drama
Tired of the hating
Be careful of the karma
Then I got the baby
Never loved the mamma
Screw them all the haters
I don't need the trauma

It's always about me doing for you
What you don't think I got problems too
Never see you when I'm broke and need a few
But you always find me when your rent is due

Sit back shut your mouth I got something to say
Everything I used to do I'm gonna change today
Why you only call me when you need my car
I've given too much been pushed too far
Can't figure out whose being real
Screw y'all fools
That's the way I feel

Cause I, can get yo' ass on the floor
Cause this, is this the funk that you want?
The hand, it comes way up in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't caaaaaaaaare
Bitch, come off of those pots
Stop, shake that junk in your trunk
See you, can move this groovyville shit
The shake that makes the whollllle club flip

You might get shot in the face if you don't stay in your place
You ain't a soldier like me you a fuckin disgrace
X move like a shark in the water, I'm dodgin death and disorder
I'll get you hit it won't cost me a quarter
I was sent here to strangle and slaughter in no particular order
Your big mouth might endanger your daughter
Another day another digit I'ma speak it and live it
Better get yourself a gun 'fore you fuck with Xzibit
Pockets shorter than a midget, you can fuckin forget it
X green light the target and easily hit it
Grab the zone and split it so we smokin them woods
Steady givin niggaz the business and keepin it hood
Firearms we packin, this is military mindstate
that's ready for action we mercenaries and assassins (blastin)
Clashin, smash out right

Let's hit the club and get it on tonight
Let's get drunk this is Saturday Night
Just got paid, shine my chrome up tight
Time to get it crackin, off the Henn' tonight

Wassup? We need to talk
Let me light my backport
(lights up)
(exhales)
That's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown

Yo, I love Los Angeles, you can hear it in my music
Plus I got the scars to prove it
And man.. you don't understand what I understand
I'm feelin like a piece to a bigger plan
'Cause all I'm sayin is the God honest truth of it all, we fightin the wrong enemy
That's why I'm gettin invovled, it's just like the end of that movie ""Saw""
When them two chained up guys met with their demise
And the mastermind was layin there the whole time
Remember that? That's why we have to sit down
And speak about the black and the brown
Now I didn't come here to point no fingers
I know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations
Shit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations
And everybody lose.. from the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it's even the high schools
'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News
when the students squared off and one kid wouldn't choose sides
Hit with a hammer and the kid died and now it's a full blown riot
Tck, that's when the fists start flyin
These kids ain't learnin shit about math and science
Man..

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Tension is so thick, some are comin around
I don't wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now.. that's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Eighty percent of inmates are black and Hispanic
They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit.. that's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown

[Xzibit]
Yo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day
He came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey
And he don't really fuck with nobody outside of the set
It's tatted big on his neck
Y'know? So over the years, built respect and trust
Some black and brown issues we both discussed
He said, ""Homes, it's been goin down too long
I gotta bang on them fools and it don't feel wrong""
""They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks
So word came down, we gotta handle that shit""
""Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts
Can I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin""
At first, I remind him of what vengeance do
What vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to
He wasn't tryna hear that shit
He just turned up the volume, bangin 50 Cent

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
I got soldiers from both sides who really don't care
Who identify themselves by the colors they wear
The homey came through to put one in the air
I can tell somethin was wrong the way he sat in his chair
He said, ""X, man I'm just gettin out
from doin eighty eight months, tryna figure things out""
He told me in the pen you get down to get done
'Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one
He showed me the scar on his gut and his neck
They got him good, said he damn near bled to death
The hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes
When he described what it feels like to almost die
All I could do was just sit back and listen
'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions
I got hit with a bottle but I'm not dead
I said, ""Think with your heart homey, not your head""
I said

[Chorus]

[Jelly Roll + (Xzibit)]
Oooooh you must defend yourself (Yeah!)
If you don't, then no one else (Nobody!)
Your homies got to ride (Let's go!)
You're fighting for your life (Yeah!)
They want both of us dead
You ain't heard a word I said
You're fighting for your life (Come on)
Your homies got to riiide

Jelly Roll,"This cannot continue
We must go our separate ways
Without you, I can do better
But first these words I have to say

It's not that I don't hear you
When you scream and curse my name
It's just that I don't feel you
Nigga, you invade my space

Yeah, blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up
I'm alge-ballin', dumb niggaz can't add it up
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin' up
All these rappers comin' out, ain't nobody showin' up

Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at
You the king of the streets? Well, I ain't heard none of that
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, 'Did it My Way'

I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide
Recognize, lost a lotta love when my momma died
Did a gang of shit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive

Fishburn's yellin' wake up, open up my eyes
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize
And criticize when you on your grind, so I realized

This cannot continue
We must go our separate ways
Without you, I'll do better
But first these words I have to say

It's not that I don't hear you
When you scream and curse my name
It's just that I don't feel you
Nigga, you invade my space

Go ahead, spit it out, that's right, get it out
So I can respond, nigga, fuck what you talk about
Drop like a guillotine, money over everythin'
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine

Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship
Came a long way from the place that I started from
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?

Hate manifest from the inside out
The shit starts in your heart, then spill out your mouth
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out
I see you tryin' to stand up but you don't stand out

Now that I found that my path is original
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle
I'm not like you, but you think we identical
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal

This cannot continue
We must go our separate ways
Without you, I'll do better
But first these words I have to say

It's not that I don't hear you
When you scream and curse my name
It's just that I don't feel you
Nigga, you invade my space

Three wheels, lock it up, ammo, stock it up
It's not for niggaz 'cause George Bush comin' after us
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go
All my people fightin' for they soul, you are not alone

Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, overkill shit

Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit
You know that young shit, the 'Hey nigga, where you from?' shit

Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand
Let's part ways and then pray for better days
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to say

This cannot continue
We must go our separate ways
Without you, I'll do better
But first these words I have to say

It's not that I don't hear you
When you scream and curse my name
It's just that I don't feel you
Nigga, you invade my space

Yeah, knowhatI'msayin'?
(You invade my space)
Yeah, stop askin' where the fuck I'm at, yeah
(Nigga, you invade my space)

Tryin' to see where I'm at
Tryin' to be where I'm at all the fuckin' time, c'mon

Get a life, nigga, I got mines, know'mtalkinbout?

Trickin' off these niggaz in the Range, rental
I was smokin', drinkin', end up kinda tipsy
Lookin' through my rear view, they followin' me

I wonder why the fuck are they followin' me
I seem them niggaz creepin' two cars behind me
You'll never catch me slippin', just me and my piece
You must be smokin' if you think I'ma call the police

I'm a beast, still got a crease
Still got my Converse thumpin' down the concrete
Black and blue Bugatti
This is Strong Arm robbery, you can't deny me

My garage, a mirage, a collage of chrome
I look alive with the nine when I leave my home
Been on tour in Japan, been relaxed in Rome
This is grown man business, recognize the tone

If I don't recognize the number, won't answer my phone
Rockin' every area code, still stay in my zone
I don't play no fuckin' games now, bitch, I'm grown
Now I crack your fuckin' neck to the shit I'm on, yeah

Six-four, chromed out, ragtop rollin'
Get your weight up 'cause X can't stop rollin'
Niggaz thought it was over but X came back rollin'
I got my own sack to roll, so I'm rollin'

Yeah, my release bang through the streets
We hang like orangutans, mangle the beat
Niggaz hatin', gravitatin' to the lies that they tell
My reality takin' over where that fiction fail

What the hell, might as well show the cards I'm holdin'
Sweet taste, aromatic, backwood rollin'
Got the Range Rover supercharged, complete with the strut kit
My chain hang to my dang-a-lang, what the fuck, bitch?

Boomerang my change, I rearrange some thangs
My slang, click, bang and expose they brains
Then I pray, “Our Father who art in Heaven”
Got people jumpin' out the buildin' like 9/11

Malcolm X to the Z, landin' on them like Plymouth Rock
You get knocked out, get socked in your fuckin' mouth
Now e'rybody know the business, you want it, come get it
But if you rollin', throw it up, let me know that you with it

Six-four, chromed out, ragtop rollin'
Get your weight up 'cause X can't stop rollin'
Niggaz thought it was over but X came back rollin'
I got my own sack to roll, so I'm rollin'

Six-four, chromed out, ragtop rollin'
Get your weight up 'cause X can't stop rollin'
Niggaz thought it was over but X came back rollin'
I got my own sack to roll, so I'm rollin'

Yeah, I repeat my name over beats
I binge on the finer things, you cringe in defeat
Escalation, elevation to another plateau
Sometimes it take a few steps back to mentally grow

Here we go, what you know? Campaign in motion
Straight West Coast and West worldwide rollin'
Got that Aston Martin DV9 equipped with a stash box
In case I ever find myself alone in a tight spot

Strip down my frame, repave my lane
Insane with my ink pen, Citizen Kane
Don't complain when the chamber slide back and bang
Make it taste like shit when you sayin' my name

It's the Golden State heavyweight, holdin' the belt
'Cause I'm a one man army, I don't need no help
This is a pistol, I use to protect myself
Careful these hammerhead hollow points
Is bad for your health, my nia

I like you in those boots, you know just what to do
Girl let me see those tattoos I'm gonna ride with you
Right here's the perfect place for me to kiss and fuck you
I can't wait to taste your sugar

I want to taste your body
I want to taste your face
I want to taste your breast taste below your waste
That's some of my many wishes
Fresh out the bubble bath girl you taste so delicious

Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'

You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'

It's gonna drive you to ruin

Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Dead Man Blues,2000

Too late to turn, cool to a slow burn
I'm not acting steady so I must be ready now

And so I go and never take my time
I make each moment mine
And when the moment comes it's no surprise
To see the future is in your eyes

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Midnight, one dream one chance of coming
The heat of this one choice, the weakness of one voice
Doors that open to sights so uncertain
My heart's open steady with magic get ready, go

This is no different then the other times
But my heart says, ""Make this mine""
You ask me how I know this is the night
'Cuz The future's in your eyes

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

Give it up

Melting, past rooftops this feeling that can't stop
The state of the night here, the pleasure of no fear
So long and so kind and so hard yet so fine
I'm not acting steady so I must be ready now, ready to go

Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love, I want your love
Dancing on the fire with just one desire
I want your love

And drop 'em in a teacup

And throw 'em over the side

To be swept up by a current
Then taken to the ocean
To be eaten by some fishes
Who were eaten by some fishes

And swallowed by a whale
Who grew so old he decomposed
He died and left his body
To the bottom of the ocean

Now everybody knows
That when a body decomposes
The basic elements
Are given back to the ocean

And the sea does what it oughta
And soon there's salty water
Which is not to good for drinkin'
'Cause it tastes just like a teardrop

So we run it through a filter
And it comes out from a faucet
Where it pours into a teapot
Which is just about to bubble

A sensory lullaby
We trade the comics, cartoons, and magazines
For pistons and gasoline

We see the road from the bedside
Parked under the sunshine
We feel the warmth of the engine so we climb inside
And take it to the motorway

Watch the clouds turn into faces it's fun to play
Shift the gears for years and age a single day
Until we spill onto Russian Hill

Past cathedrals filled with God's favorite guests
Dirty hands feel clean when dressed in their Sunday best
Treeline village oh so heavenly
Cross a bridge of gold to landscapes of juniper

Only Eden is for millionaires

We head home past the shoreline
And through the rear view mirror it all melts away

Start to fade

Where two young boys started mocking me
I looked at them.
Thought I'll show you one day
But I didn't fight or stand up for me.
And that young girl's learn the hard way

And if I've got to toughen up then that is what I'll do

Hey, no se.
Maria, igual encuentras un
Chico guapo.
No se, estoy cansada.
Sabes que? Que vas a salir y
Será una gran noche.

Spinning round and
I touch the ground
And I, let go of my mind
Let the music take
Over my body
An' I start to unwind
Feel the heat as I rock the beat
And I see your sexy smile
Intense attraction,
Bodies like magnets

Moving forward and
Arching back
With that, hot look in your eye
Up so close I can feel
You touching me
No time to be shy
Head to head no I
Won't be lead
Well I, I'll put up a fight
Feel the bass, now my
Pulse is racing
And, I'm flying tonight

'Cause this pain in my heart is taking everything from me
If it's true that love makes the world go round
Please give some love to me

God, give me strength to keep on walking
God, give me strength to keep on, keep on
God, give me strength to keep on walking

The air's got so thick, I find it hard to breathe
And never before have I felt so desperately in need
I know that I must start listening to the voice inside of me

Jem,"Too much information
Need to calm down, let go
Breath in peace
Worry and anxious feelings
Need to close your eyes, let go
Breathe and release

All of a sudden the people,
The talking, the telephone,
All fades away
You visit a place in a timeless
Dimension where all of your
Fears are at bay

You can fly away
Fly like a bird
Across the sky
Above the clouds so high
Moon and the stars
Light up the sky

Presence fights illusion
It's not all as serious as
Your mind
Wants you to think it is
Unsure of your future
Need to focus on,
What you want
And something will come
Your way

All of a sudden the negative
Voices and weaknesses
All fade away
You visit a place in a timeless
Dimension where all of your
Fears are at bay

You can fly away
Fly like a bird
Across the sky
Above the clouds so high
Moon and the stars
Light up the sky

Sun sets low across the bay
A beautiful light
Closes the day
You can visit anytime
It's always there
Just close your eyes
[repeat]

(You know, you know, you
Know, you know, you know
If you wanna be, home free,
Just breathe
You know, you know, you know,
You know, you know
If you wanna be, home free,
Just breathe
You know all you need, all you
Need, all you need, all you
Need, is to feel connected
You know all you need, all you
Need, all you need, all you
Need, is to be connected
Slow down, slow down,
What you rushing for)

Jem,"Go to bed, everything's alright
Don't know the whole world's changing
As you sleep through the night
Wake up slowly and it's a different world

Hear the news and the floods begin
Screams so loud but only felt within
Heart is shattered
The pieces can't be found

I feel your pain
I wrote this song for you, for you
You will make it, you will make it through
I promise you he would want you to

Months go by still living in a daze
Don't know what you've done
With the last seven days
Soul is numb and life is like a dream

Helping hands but you push them away
How could they understand
Don't wanna share your pain
Afraid to heal 'cause that would mean goodbye

I feel your pain
I wrote this song for you, for you
You will make it, you will make it through
I promise you, she would want you to

One day sunlight hits a photograph
And it makes you smile
The memories dance around you now
And they make you smile

You're not alone, you'll never be
Just like the stars they oversee
And they whisper to you you're still, you're still
You're still, you're still alive

I feel your pain
I wrote this song for you, for you
You will make it, you will make it through
I promise you, they would want you to

Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there, I do not sleep
I am a thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints on snow

I am the sun on ripened grain
I am the gentle autumn rain
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush

Of quiet birds in circled flight
I am the soft stars that shine at night
Do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there, I did not die
",You Will Make It,2008
Jem,"Do it now
You know you are
You feel it in your heart
And your burning and wishin'

At 1st wait,it won't be on a plate
Your gonna work for it harder and harder
And I know cause I've been there before
Knockin' on door with rejection (rejection)
And you'll see cause if its meant to be
Nothing can compare to deserving your dream

It's amazing, it's amazing all that you can do
It's amazing it makes my heart sing
Now its up to you

Patience now frustration in the air
And people who don't care
Well its gonna get you down
And you'll fall (fall)
Yes you will hit a wall
Get back up on your feet
And you'll be stronger and smarter

And I know I've been there before
Knockin' on door wont take no for an answer

Nothing can compare to deserving your dream

Are in love, but I know in my heart
This was so meant to be

I've got a bullet in the clip so what ya want?
I've got a lyric I can spit so what ya want?
I'm giving bitches good dick so what ya want?
Hey, hey, so what'cha want?
My Ghetto Pop Life hotter than a hot slice
I'm an urban entertainer of the hot nights
I don't wanna see no end because it's not right

I'm just a brother who never
Compromised his integrity
My legacy is heavenly
Bury me in the hood
Never think I'm not cautious, hey
I recognize what a wrong look'll cost us
So inside I'm always nervous
But I never look worried
Come for me
Gun shot flurries in a hurry
Come get me
And be where I perform, stay warm
I'm prepared for the storm
And I brought the heat with me
Lord, please talk to these boys
'Fore I leave they evening spoilt
Put 'em six feet up under the soil
Looking at the roots of trees
Better yet leave they bodies all out in the open so the flies can feed
And when the 'hood get dry I supply the need
Y'all fagot niggas keep it moving honey riding with me
So what ya want?

[Chorus]

And I never politic when I be on some cool out shit
Don't even run up on me talking 'bout some artist that you signed
'Cos I don't really give a fuck and I ain't really got the time
I'm trying to put some money in my clothes
Sean clothes, Jah clothes
First, did you come with six zeros?
Fuck y'all then, I'm trying to put some dubs on the road
Then just slide up in the club and try to bubble some hoes
Player, the harder we grind, the further we go
I'm at the point I'm ready to commit a murder to blow
Whatever it takes, I see the nigga holding the case
Look dead in his face, hit the nigga holding the weight
Make his man take me to the crib and go in the safe
Jah done made the reservation so we ready to peel
For real, without no hesitation Nitty bustin' the steel
So what ya what?

I'm a O.G in the flesh (true to life)
Giving birth to these young seeds (new to life)
East New York Bed-Stuy nigga (do or die)
I was aiming for his head (it went through his eye)
Pimp nigga, Goldie, Shaft (super fly)
Mixed with a little cheese (from Coolie High)
Mommy how you gonna move? (when it's just you and I)
Pardon me a second dude (you better get in line)
Confrontation time, get in line or spit a rhyme
I ain't looking for no beef but I will oblige
I'm kinda quiet but surprise I ain't really shy
Didn't mean to shock you with the real
But niggas know the deal
When I'm up in punk knockers and down in Sugar Hill
Call me Mr Foreverman, can't say I never ran and never will
But when the shells get to flying and I don't got skill
I get ghost then I bounce
Come back and a nigga be ready to throw toast

Listen, momma said there'd be days like this
Where I'd have to set the record straight on a plagiarist
Who played the fifth row
Had to let the kid know even if he played the fifth
I'd still get in his ass like a wedgie
Ready or not I be lyrical machete that cut
Through bricks and steel 'cause sticks and stones might
Break ya bones
But they won't end the rhetoric
The evidence is in, I'm guilty
'Cause the verdict is my cleverness with pen
Murder music murder men
The mo' time go by the mo' intense my lyrical flow
To show the privates that they can't follow where generals go
I leave the troops and the battles and the trenches
You succeed with flukes and coincidences
You have no defenses against my sub tenses
I'm all up in the game and you sidelined on the benches
Defenseless against this
From the beginning it was senseless
You bit more than you could chew
It's knocking out your dentures
""But I but I but I but I but I but I but I I figga, that I'm a bad nigga I'm
a bad nigga
I'm a bad bad nigga""

[Chorus]

I love it when it's my turn
And faces start to look crazy concerned
They know I'm about to burn baby burn
From the facility
The city'll need a lot of H20
When I'm finished you'll need a place to go
Face the facts
I flow from the brain to the paper to the wax
Back niggas down like automatic gunfire
I perspire when I show a MC how to holla for the have my power locked down
like Rottweiler dogs
Don't be appalled at the crowd just because they applaud
When they lock-jawed but don't follow yours
Yours was only endured for a minute or more
Until I took the floor
And came through with the definitive raw
The textbook definition of ""damn he nice!""
I'm so explosive like bullets bust from ya biscuit
Sometimes my shit is too explicit to risk it
But these idiots love the pain
And they ain't really tryin' to risk it
Nigga listen!

[Chorus]

So check the rhyme to the rhythm
Or shiver when I give a
Very fat deliver-why
The process only Jemini, me
Other MC's is corny I set ya souls free
The baddest born motherfucker ever to pick up a mic
And when I touch the structure
Watch the structure rupture
Clutch ya, might butt ya
Not the type to get down with the baddest
The Jemini status
I'm blunt with the gun so I stomp out ya business
Plus I can dominate ya physical fitness
So witness the Jemini shit comin' from way back
Beef with me chief I throw the blade to ya nutsack for payback
Don't ya try to diss me like a gamer
I got rhymes in the clip plus one inside the chamber
Danger, so cock the glock near ya jock

I'm a bad nigga

Out of the garden gate with an apple in their hands
I expect and i believe
You're gonna run out of love
You're gonna give me the shove
'Cause that's the thing that lovers do
Then there's you

You found me cynical and jaded
You lifted my mask and lightened me up
And when my black eyes have faded
I found they were gouged
Had the coal in my mouth
I've never seen the old age new
And then there's you

You're the only one
Who knows my secrets
You're the only one

""And we must believe that no one will criticize us for speaking honestly""

[Chorus]

Listen, momma said there'd be days like this
Where I'd have to set the record straight on a plagiarist
Who played the fifth row
Had to let the kid know even if he played the fifth
I'd still get in his ass like a wedgie
Ready or not I be lyrical machete that cut
Through bricks and steel 'cause sticks and stones might
Break ya bones
But they won't end the rhetoric
The evidence is in, I'm guilty
'Cause the verdict is my cleverness with pen
Murder music murder men
The mo' time go by the mo' intense my lyrical flow
To show the privates that they can't follow where generals go
I leave the troops and the battles and the trenches
You succeed with flukes and coincidences
You have no defenses against my sub tenses
I'm all up in the game and you sidelined on the benches
Defenseless against this
From the beginning it was senseless
You bit more than you could chew
It's knocking out your dentures
""But I but I but I but I but I but I but I I figga, that I'm a bad nigga I'm
a bad nigga
I'm a bad bad nigga""

[Chorus]

I love it when it's my turn
And faces start to look crazy concerned
They know I'm about to burn baby burn
From the facility
The city'll need a lot of H20
When I'm finished you'll need a place to go
Face the facts
I flow from the brain to the paper to the wax
Back niggas down like automatic gunfire
I perspire when I show a MC how to holla for the have my power locked down
like Rottweiler dogs
Don't be appalled at the crowd just because they applaud
When they lock-jawed but don't follow yours
Yours was only endured for a minute or more
Until I took the floor
And came through with the definitive raw
The textbook definition of ""damn he nice!""
I'm so explosive like bullets bust from ya biscuit
Sometimes my shit is too explicit to risk it
But these idiots love the pain
And they ain't really tryin' to risk it
Nigga listen!

[Chorus]

So check the rhyme to the rhythm
Or shiver when I give a
Very fat deliver-why
The process only Jemini, me
Other MC's is corny I set ya souls free
The baddest born motherfucker ever to pick up a mic
And when I touch the structure
Watch the structure rupture
Clutch ya, might butt ya
Not the type to get down with the baddest
The Jemini status
I'm blunt with the gun so I stomp out ya business
Plus I can dominate ya physical fitness
So witness the Jemini shit comin' from way back
Beef with me chief I throw the blade to ya nutsack for payback
Don't ya try to diss me like a gamer
I got rhymes in the clip plus one inside the chamber
Danger, so cock the glock near ya jock
But I, I figga', that I'm a bad nigga I'm a bad nigga, I'm a bad bad nigga
I'm a bad nigga
And we was singing that",Omega Supreme [DM Remix],2004

Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.

So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”

I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

A certain way you dance around
And crack a smile and break me down
After the third act when you come home
You turn it off and turn me on
When you think no one's watching
When you're taken by the moment
When you forget what you're thinking and you say what you really feel
When you're in-between poses
And when your laughter takes over
That's when you're floating with the angels, that's when you're floating with
The angels
For such a softie, you try so hard
You get so angry that you're not a star
But if you could show them what you show me
In your pajamas acting like you're three
When you think no one's watching
When you're taken by the moment
When you forget what you're thinking and you say what you really feel
When you're in-between poses
And when your laughter takes over
That's when you're floating with the angels, that's when you're floating with
The angels
And when you laugh a little too loud
And spill your coffee all over
And when you're singing in the shower
I see your cup runneth over
And chocolate sundaes make you smile
And Monday morning, stay awhile you're beautiful
When you think no one's watching
When you're taken by the moment
When you forget what you're thinking and you say what you really feel
When you're in-between poses
And when your laughter takes over

Broke-down
Stuck here in the same old place that we've been
For so many years, Baby, please don't hold me back
I'm ready to go
Burnt-out
Void of any power, I realize now I gave it up so freely
And left myself in your
Complete control
How can I blame you for wanting us to stay the same?
Why would you change us when everything goes your way?
It's up to me now
Baby, I'm ready to go away, so far away
I have got to find myself again
Don't hold me back
I'm finally ready to go
Hold tight
Baby, don't persuade me to stay, I just might
For fear of how your voice cuts me and how your hands choke me
Please let me go
Free fall
Closer to the ground than I thought
What a rush, amazing what a woman can do
When she is ready to face the unknown
And I dream of happiness that no one can ever take away
From deep within me to the edges of all time and space
Maybe it's out there
Baby, I'm ready to go away, so far away
I have got to find myself again
Don't hold me back
I'm finally ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go away, so far away
I have got to find myself again
Don't hold me back

Pockets full of money that I saved and never spent
A shoebox full of letters that I wrote and never sent
Words of love and promises I thought but never said
Hoping that I wouldn't fall behind

Nights I wasted dreaming things that I forgot when I awoke
Journeys I had plotted out, but I never found the road
Running into strangers, never looking in their eyes
All the magic that we might have shared if not for my disguise
And still, I'm grateful to be alive, and waiting for the moment to arrive
Seize the moment when it comes
Seize the moment - it may be the only one
Seize the moment - don't you let it pass you by
You've gotta seize the moments of your life

I tried to say I love you but I was paralyzed
I wanted to find happiness but I lost it in your eyes
I waited far too many years before I realized
I have wasted all the best years of my life
Just waiting for the moment to arrive
Seize the moment when it comes
Seize the moment - it may be the only one
Seize the moment - don't you let it pass you by
You've gotta seize the moments of your life

Oh, what am I waiting for?
There is really nothing more than this precious moment
And all this love I have inside
Now it's time to let it shine, so let it shine, let it shine
Seize the moment when it comes
Seize the moment - it may be the only one
Seize the moment - don't you let it pass you by
You've gotta seize the moments of your life




",Seize the Moment,2003
Jen Foster,"
I have heard it said so many times, ""Love is blind""
So why are you staring?
You say that love is all we need, well
Does that apply to me?
'Cause I have found someone
That I think is beautiful
And I have fallen in love
And I'm telling you
She
Means everything to me
She
Makes me feel nothing else matters
Not even what the world thinks of me
They told me when I was a little girl, ""Love's a pearl -
You're lucky if you find it,
So share that precious beauty with the world,""
Now suddenly they say I've got to hide it
But I have found true love
And there is nothing you can do
Just try and stop me, just try and stop us
Good luck to you, 'cause
She
Means everything to me
She
Makes me feel nothing else matters
Not even what the world thinks of me
(She...she...she...)
It's simple as can be
I love her, she loves me
This is what everybody dreams of
There's nothing to be afraid of, there's nothing to be afraid of, after all it's
Only love
'cause
She
Means everything to me
She
Makes me feel nothing else matters




",She,2003

Well, here we are
Our final meeting
If you told me it would end like this
I wouldn't have believed
I'd be standing here above you
Crying tears upon your face
Imagining your eyes would open
If only I'd say the right thing
If I could say the right thing
And it looks just like you are sleeping
So peacefully at rest after the longest, hardest day
And you look so sweet, as if you're dreaming
I only wish you could awake before the angels carried you away
So it's time to let you go
Fly away now and be free
And in your never-ending slumber
Will you please save a dream for me
And I will gently place this flower
In your hand before I leave
They say you cannot take it with you
But this could be the one thing
This love could be the one thing
And it looks just like you are sleeping
So peacefully at rest after the longest, hardest day
And you look so sweet, as if you're dreaming
I only wish you could awake before the angels carried you away
Carried you away
And it looks just like you are sleeping
So peacefully at rest after the longest, hardest day
And you look so sweet, as if you're dreaming




",Sleeping,2003
Jen Foster,"I've centered my whole life around your every need
And I got the groceries and I kept the house real clean
And I never once complained
Cause I love you
And I waited here at home while you went out with all your friends
Yeah, I got into your groove, Babe, although I never quite fit in
I was a little offbeat
And not on cue
Do you even see me standing here before you?
Do you even hear me or do I bore you?
Hey, I really feel kind of stupid just trying to be everything to you
But it does no good, I could never be that cool, yeah
Have I ever told you how I paint you in my mind?
But when I put the brush to canvas I find you hard to recognize
Cause you're looking straight at me,
Right in my eyes
And suddenly I feel me reaching trying to find the real you
And you smile and pacify me and happily I play the fool
Is there something I can get you?
It's what I do
Are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Are you empty?
Is it getting cold in here or is it just me?
Hey, I really feel kind of stupid just trying to be everything to you
But it does no good, I could never be that cool, yeah
And I am only now accepting I am human, I cannot be Superwoman
Oh, it's so easy to love you, but it's hard to be that cool, yeah?
I'm not Superwoman, don't know how to fly
I'm not Superwoman,- I gave it my best try
I'm not Superwoman, someday I'm gonna die
What a life?

I never noticed all the used black cars out on the road
I never noticed all the love songs that are on the radio
Until you left me
Now it's all too clear
I never noticed all the houses that look just like where you live
I never noticed all the places that remind me where we've been
Until you left me
Now I see too clearly
That there's nobody in this world who makes me feel the way you do
And there's nobody in my life who could come close to being you
And there's nobody else who gets me
Nobody like you
And there's nobody who inspires me to be better than I am
And there's nobody who ignites me with the touch of their hands
And there's nobody else who loves me
Nobody like you
I took for granted all the little things you did to let me know
How much you loved me - I bankrupted your soul
Until you left me
Won't you please forgive me
How can I make it up? How can I convince you?
I would do anything in this world for you
Until you left me
I had no clue that it was you
That there's nobody in this world who makes me feel the way you do
And there's nobody in my life who could come close to being you
And there's nobody else who gets me
Nobody like you
And there's nobody who inspires me to be better than I am
And there's nobody who invites me to give a damn
And there's nobody else who loves me
Nobody like you
And I have had a lot of growing up to do
And I have got a lot of making up to you
For I can do so much better
For someone as special as you
And I like the way sometimes we talk just like we're babies
And I like the way sometimes your no means maybe, well
Maybe, Baby?

Here I come, you better watch out
I'm falling like the rain
On the run from all of the clouds
They're chasing me away
I wish I could stay
But I am just not built that way, yeah
I'm water in your hands now
I'm slipping
I'm caught up in the moment, soon I will be going
You can't keep water in your hands
Don't be sad, Baby, don't cry
This is just the way that life goes
Just like that, hello and goodbye
What we catch we really can't hold
I wish you could see

I never stopped and looked, I never paid attention to you
I didn't think that you were worth my time
A passing glance my way caught me on a day like today
And all your brilliant colors light up my eyes
I'm falling in
I'm spinning now
I'm trapped in you
And I don't want out
You drew me into your web of roses
You tangled me up in violets of blue
And you pulled me into your pocket full of poses
I'm captured by you, I am captured by you
You love me, you love me not
I pick a thousand petals and pray that I'll stay in your heart
'Cause you're beautiful as if by design
I am yours, are you mine?

And I don't want out
You drew me into your web of roses
You tangled me up in violets of blue
And you pulled me into your pocket full of poses
I'm captured by you, I am captured by you
And what is it now that you want from me?
You already have everything I tried so hard to keep
And I'm letting go, I'm trusting you, trust in me

c'mon, take my hand
A surprise is awaiting you
We'll sprawl out on the sand
And unwind by the light of the moon
Forget your father's face
Forget the debts you have to pay
Forget the things I'm saying
Let's get away, yeah
We could fly out of this place
And out into space where Saturn awaits us
We could fly straight through the sky, way over county lines
Where Saturn's a state of mind
C'mon, let's take a trip
We can lay on my big brass bed, yeah
We don't need no rocketship to get there
These rings around my heart, you see, are where we'll find the mystery
We could fly out of this place
And out into space where Saturn awaits us
We could fly straight through the sky, way over county lines
'Cause Saturn's a state of mind
Forget about the fear inside you
Look at all the stars to guide you

The black and white picture taken by a stranger
Out in the streets of New Orleans
The blanket I stole from that hotel in London
You asked if I thought I was the Queen
And my big blue sweater - you made it look better
Is folded in the corner of your suitcase
You're taking everything, you've got my heart on a string
Just tell me where we are going
All I am is where you are
And I never knew you could go so far
All I have is in your heart
You took me with you, you took me with you
The broken wine bottle that fell off our mantle
We couldn't stand to throw that sweet memory away
The book by Fitzgerald that I bought for your birthday
Is packed in a box with my love letters you saved
And you're taking Bob Dylan, oh, the times must be changing
Maybe you'll listen as you're driving away
You're taking everything, you've got my heart on a string
C'mon tell me where we are going
All I am is where you are
And I never knew you could go so far
All I have is in your heart
You took me with you, you took me with you
Those shells from the ocean, that one, yellow rose and
The incense and candles and your old tambourine
Your sweatshirt from college, that painting that you wanted
And I'll take the promise that you could not keepâ?¦.
All I am is where you are
And I never knew you could go so far

When the light of love surrounds you
When the dark of night confounds you
When the shadow life astounds you
Breathe in, and say amen, amen, once again
The day breaks in technicolor
A mother wakes her child from slumber
A little boy peeks out from under the sheets and grins
Say amen, amen, once again
At times this world can be so beautiful
It's hard to take it all in
But don't you be afraid, just let it rain
And say amen
A boy kisses a girl for the first time
A bird leaves her nest and takes flight
A broken man gets up and tries again
Say amen, amen, once again
At times this world can be so beautiful
It's hard to take it all in
But don't you be afraid, just let it rain
And say amen

Pieces, falling
Through the sky, I'm wanting
To feel you beneath me
But not like this, believe me
No, I can't wake up, no I can't crash down
To half that's lost and half that's found
I can't believe that you
Would leave me this way
I am broken up into a thousand pieces
You have stolen one, it's a piece I needed
I can't open up, you can't close me shut
I am broken
Pieces, floating
Up off the ground, exploding
I feel you above me
But not like this, don't rush me
'Cause I cannot look, no, I cannot find
The half that's yours and the half that's mine
I can't believe that you
Could leave me this way
I am broken up into a thousand pieces
You have stolen one, it's a piece I needed
I can't open up, you can't close me shut
I am broken
And you stole my heart
Right from the wreckage
Now I can't ever be put back together
Pieces, resting
Upon the ground you're blessing
Can you feel me beneath me?
All over everywhere?

I'm lost when memories are all I have to breathe
I'm lost when endings are always just beginning
Where did you go? All that I know
Is I loved you way too much
Everybody goes, everybody leaves you
There's no one you can own and no one you could pay
Everyone's alone and there's nothing to believe in
And nothing you can do and nothing you can say
You're gone like oceans of love all blown out to sea
You're gone like everyone who's ever come to me
Now here I am, without you I can't
See myself go on
Everybody goes, everybody leaves you
There's no one you can own and no one you could pay
Everyone's alone and there's no one to believe in
And nothing you can do and nothing you can say
Give me a moment to prepare myself
Give me a moment to put on a better face
Give me a moment to collect myself
As you walk away
Everybody goes, everybody goes
Everybody goes away
Everybody goes, everybody leaves you

Day begins, break of noon
A little light might be nice in this room
Tangled in sheets, on second thought
Some photographs are better in the dark
And I thought you might come home this summer
And maybe there will be sun in seattle
Awake again, the clock strikes three
Peek out the window, the moon is mocking me
These medications are fucking with my head
This roof is leaking and my ship's a feather bed
And I thought you might come home this summer
And maybe there will be sun in seattle
Please, please come home, home
Please, please come home, home...
And I thought you might come home this summer
And maybe there will be sun in seattle
And I thought you might come home this summer

Light the stars in your eyes
Quiet doubts in your mind
Follow me to the place where our colors bled
The young, invincible ones
Rockets aimed at the sun
We never once questioned where we were going
They called us all wrong, and they trashed all our songs
They dressed us for church, and they threw us in blind
We gathered our hands, and we turned towards the wind
It was our time
We were gods, we were gods
We were gods, at least, we thought
I will never forget
Days we skipped out of class
The subtle crash of a kiss still forbidden
When time was our time to waste
And love was ours to forsake
And all our biggest mistakes gave us all our best stories
We threw out the map, and we tossed up our caps
We swore that we'd break every brick in that wall
But it took all our breath when we found that they'd set us up
To fall
We were gods, we were gods
We were gods, at least, we thoughtâ?¦..
Before we were lawyers
And homeless self-employers
Before we crash-landed
Into the sky...
We were gods, we were gods

Pourtant mes envies sont loin
Quand tout va bien
Je ne ressens rien

Mon bonheur a tué une part de moi
Pardonne moi
Mais mon bonheur c'est toi
Aide moi

Donne moi moins d'attention
Fais moi mal sans raison
Trompe toi de prénom
Mon ange soit mon démon
Ne m'aime pas pour toujours
Mon ange joue moi un tour
Sois ma belle déception
Oublie l'ange deviens mon démon

Je m'efface sur mon nuage
Noircis mon ciel 
Donne moi le pire des orages
Arrache la flèche qui m'a heurté
Libère mes larmes
Détruis moi pour me garder

Mon amour a tué une part de moi
Pardonne moi
Mais mon amour c'est toi
Aide moi


J'ai besoin retrouver ma noirceur
Pour me sentir en vie
Je me suis perdu à trop chercher le bonheur
Je ne suis pas faites pour lui...

And it all works together, why can't we

Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark 
While my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see 
They were playing together, why can't we 
Why can't we 
Why can't we 
I can love you and you can love me 
Why can't we 
Why can't we 
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be 
Why can't we 
And I had a dream about a lion and a lamb 
They were laying together and there was peace in the land 
And so it became precious 'cause there were no enemies 
And I woke up and wondered, God why can't we 
Why can't we 
Why can't we 
I can you love you and you can love me 
Why can't we

Sentimientos no funcionan
De lo que ella llama vida (Yo necesito hablarte)
Aunque sea tan difícil aceptarlo
Baby tú sabes que yo
No le hago caso a los comentarios
Sigo protegiendo ese amor de locos
Sin importar lo que digan en el barrio
Dime si las palabras te matan no
Imaginémonos que solo somos tú y yo
Dicen que es un amor de locos
Pero que importa lo que digan en el barrio (¡Jenay!)

Todos critican todos señalan
Hoy haremos lo que nos de la gana
En esta relación mandamos solos tú y yo (Tú y yo)

Todos critican todos señalan
Hoy haremos lo que nos de la gana

Tu eres la jefa
Yo solo soy un simple cadete
Que digan lo que quieran yo sigo con mi piquete
Nuestra relación no es de juguete
Mucho billete acicálate te paso a recoger alas siete
Terremoto ella baila y en el piso hace un roto
Pedimos botellas y empiezo el alboroto
Ella conduce la rumba y yo soy su copiloto
Mi mami sabe que de su cuerpo yo soy devoto
Nos vamos de crucero, bailamos bolero
Le pido dos shots de tequila al cantinero
Yo sigo vacilando jugando con ella, somos callejeros
A mi no me importa lo que digan tú eres la que yo prefiero

Se pone fabulosa y no hay quien la pare
El único que la frena soy yo
Súper poderosa y no hay quien la pare
El único que la frena soy yo

Fresas con chocolate (La Jefa)
Después de hacerte el amor nos vamos en el yate (Tú me dices)

El único que la frena soy yo
Súper poderosa y no hay quien la pare

Jenay,"Los Vaqueros, luchando por esto que llamamos vida
Vivimos día a día con mucha gallardía
Y demostrando siempre la hombría
Ser un vaquero no es coger un arma y sentirte más que nadie
Un vaquero respeta para que lo respeten,
No importando el ni el tamaño ni el corillo con que se encuentre el otro
Un vaquero siempre mantendrá la cabeza en alto
Porque esta claro en su andar
Muchos por ahí vociferan que son vaqueros y que son esto y lo otro
Pero mira mejor aprenda de los que saben de esto
Déjese llevar por los que le dan consejos para bien
Y no de aquellos que ponen un arma en sus manos para que le tire a un hermano
No sea un monigote, demostremos la inteligencia de defender la razón
Recuerden que cuando la verdad llega, la mentira baja la cabeza
Hago un llamado a que se respete a la familia,
A que no se le esté tirando a esos carros,
Que las mujeres o niños van monta'o
A nadie le gustaría pasar por eso
Para ser un vaquero te hace falta corazón
Para decir las cosas tal cual y siempre cumplir con tu palabra
Y éste que les voy a presentar es el líder de los vaqueros
Wisin, te habla tu amigo Gavilan
Despertando conciencia en los vaqueros
Doble U que dejen la nebula
Que saben que les tenemos el ojo clavao

¡doble U! Okay, los vaqueros llegamos, ustedes toditos temblaron
Hablaron, roncaron pero nunca me pararon, cambiaron
Quisieron medir fuerzas conmigo y se estrellaron
Hice un llamado y los duros del género se reportaron
En verdad los don ustedes no aguantan mi presión
No me hables de dinero ni de proyección
Movimientos millonarios de nación a nación,
Los que conocen la operación los vaqueros de expedición
De inmediato, liricamente esto es un maltrato
Y estaba pa rato seguimos en el liderato,
Ustedes huelen a envidia me lo dice el olfato
Midiendo fuerzas pelagatos yo tengo los campeonatos

La marash
Del aeropuerto al concierto tengo todo self
Cierro todo allí luego regreso al jet
Prendo un blon en el aire que el piloto dice oh shit
Y al bajarme del avión me monté en un corvette
Ando fuera de control parezco una epidemia
Tengo tanto Flow que puedo abrir una academia
Y enseñarte a vestir y enseñarte a rapiar
Todo me queda bien aunque en verdad me quede mal
Cuidado con lo que hablan o vayan a hablar
Hasta a Pablo lo mataron, aquí nadie es inmortal (Escobar)
Los rifles del pana mío están locos por disparar
Y si te dan, no te salvan en el hospital
Prrrra
Causan heridas difícil de ver,
Profundo ni un sastre te puede coser
Mala mía es que ya los mató sin querer
Pero si no los mato como mi familia va a comer

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh)
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Tumbe esa cara de misterio (uoh)
Hagan planes pa' su entierro que andamos a fuego
Somos los vaqueros (uoh
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedoo

Seguimos frescos, sacados de la caja
El princi
El cerebro
El mueka, brrr
Saliendo pa fuera, Jordan en piel de pantera
Dicen Cosculluela a veces exagera
Intachable, nunca me han declarado culpable
Y bajar al nivel de ustedes ya no es negociable
Marica, los oyeron lo certifican
Diamantes en mi Rolex ya parecen canicas
Es inmenso el motor en el Ferrari menso
Tu no me vas a alcanzar en un Mercedes Benz
El piquete, el águila tras el billete
En sociedad con el tirao negro del doblete
Rapero estás escuchando el verdadero,
Cosculluela comandando Los Vaqueros

Ajustame el audífono que esto es pa los vaqueros
Si hay que romper el micrófono
Leyendo lo que escribo en la nota de mi telefono
Ya soy un icono, apuntandoles el rostro como blancos de polígonos
'Toy pensando que yo vengo en la fe del piloto
Lambe escroto de ese rostro te vo a sacar el poroto
Ay ma, que el lugar teniente cambien el sendero
La sociedad del dinero y yo matando en los vaqueros
Siente el rantantan fue que volvió el animal dale siguelo
Con los de Guayaquil te la vo a busca
Ya yo estoy aquí no me voy a salir
Quien me va a sacar si como yo no hay
Así que no lo intentes
Porque quedarás con daños permanentes

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo
Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa' su entierro
Que andamos a fuego, somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego, aquí no hay miedo

Andan vociferando de que pistolean
Que me darán muerte donde yo me vea
Quisiera ver tu cara cuando me meta tu aldea
Y le limpie la cacharra al frente tuyo al más que mea
Dímelo Wisin llegaron los vaqueros del futurum
Fue casi de seguro brincaran como canguro
Pendejo operaciones millonarias decisiones
Un quimico fresco pa hacer temblar las naciones
Bajando al enemigo del caballo a lo Billy The Kid
Un solo fantasmeo y doble U no salen de aquí
Fuego pa ti te va a caer cuando me activar
Los vaqueros tienen calibre y rompen al que se la vive

Yo los he visto como ladran, como se crecen en un par de meses
Pero cuando explota el peo, se desaparecen
Vociferan que son líder, roncan que son los killer
Se meten un par de pepas y los pasos no los miden
El miedo les falla el pulso, hacer calle ya no hay pulso
Vaqueros tamo aquí so que controlen los impulsos
Y los requisitos son hay que tener cojones,
No hablar mierda en las canciones, 'tar ready pa las misiones
Y se monta too el mundo, se respeta al que respete
Yo estoy en la calle desde que pito tenia grillete
Yo te la traigo como eco eco seo pa que llegue
Si no te mando a los dementes pa que de una te frenen
Dile Wisin que yo si que soy real,
Que yo no fantasmeo, que yo si soy un anormal
En moto seca a trabajar, los bajo el palo sin hablar
Dile jordán el significado de ser leal (Se reporta el menor)

Enmascarao como el Zorro, ando solo soy el Horrellender
Los enemigos me ven, se las ponen y gritan danger
Blindao de negro completo, abran paso llegó Darth Vader,
Batman siempre fue el mejor por eso nunca fue un Avenger
Vaqueros llegó pancho villa, me encanta el protagonismo
De que van a roncarme a mi cabrones de lo mismo
Ya yo estoy acá arriba sigue subiendo la cuenta
De aquí yo los espero con Las toro bajo cuentas
Me dicen Kevin Durant el 35 de los thunder
Por que sin mi la giny sin coger ni un solo conver
Esto no es Toy Story buddy agarrate el sombrero
Que el menor no está jugando, preguntale a los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

Cuando me apunten
Espero que no fallen y sean certeros
No hagan que yo los madrugue primero
Si se la juegan se les cae el sombrero
Se meten con los vaqueros

¡pusho!
Hoy cambiamos la history no tuve que engancharme en la fory,
Porque ando con 10 vaqueros y no son los de toy story
Reverencia tranquilo, abranle paso al pupilo
Que en estilo me lo tasaron este un millón de kilos
Tanto file, las tarjetas negras no me da decline
Yo nunca pierdo aunque me vaya Cinco veces over time
Tamos a lo fucker llenando hasta los estadios de soccer
El acto principal muchachos, volvió Paul Walker
Doble U me dijo que rompa
Que yo soy la A porque se come alas compás
Matando a estos rajeros que se meten en todos los agujeros
Soy el único novato rompiendo en los vaqueros

Tumbe esa cara de misterio
Hagan planes pa su entierro que andamos a fuego
Y somos los vaqueros
Los dueños del juego aquí no hay miedo

Tumbe esa cara de misterio,
Hagan planes pa su entierro que andamos a fuego

Es casi suicida esta locura de querernos a escondidas
¿Dime cómo no perderme en tu mirada?
¿Cómo pretender que no siento nada?
Cómo hacerle caso a la razón?

Si tenerte cerca es mi dolor
Si es mala palabra nuestro amor
¿Cómo anestesiar al corazón?
¿Si tú lo sabes, dime cómo?
¿Si tú lo sabes, dime cómo?

Se que, te han herido una y otra vez

Lloras, lloras, tanto que parece lluvia 
Déjame, cuidar de ti, de ti, de ti 
Se que tienes el alma rota, rota, rota
Y que piensas que eres irreparable 
Déjame, déjame repararte 
Déjame repararte 

Se por qué, se por que apagas la luz 
Y es por que yo he estado ahí sintiendo 
Lo que sientes tu, solo no me dejes tan solo 

Bajo la lluvia déjame cuidar de ti, de ti, de ti 
Se que tienes el alma rota, rota, rota 
Y que piensas que eres irreparable 
Déjame, déjame repararte

Mark Gersmehl, Jeni Varnadeau
There's a place in the night where it's just you and me
There's no where to go but here with my dreams
The shadows close in, the doubts start to flow
There's nowhere to look but deep in my soul
You are whispering secrets I'm longing to hear
I want to receive it but I cannot get near
Can I really let go or am I holding on to fear?
CHORUS
If I believed with a holy passion
I'd throw hesitation to the wind
If I would love you with abandon
My trust in you would never end
If I believed, If I believed, If I believed
Lord, hear my prayer, show me what to do
I want to be closer and closer to you
I try to move forward but I'm stuck in my tracks
I long for the day when I'm not holding back
What should I keep? What should I lose?
Give me the wisdom to know what to choose
Whatever You want, Lord, that's what I want to do
CHORUS
BRIDGE
I believe, help me with my unbelief
I believe, help me with my unbelief
Help me believe
But if I really believed every word You've spoken
Surrendered my little hopes and dreams
If I believed I can't imagine
Just what my life would really mean
If I really believed with reckless passion
I would live so differently
I would have no hesitation
In giving you every part of me
If I believed, If I believed, If I believed.

Jenica Rayne,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost",Ghost,2007

Jenifer,"Au beau milieu de la ville, une rivière
Courant subtil, acide et solitaire
Mais le fleuve est à cran
Revoilà la crue
Tout n'est que torrent gratte-ciels, temps perdu
La vie comme un fleuve
Au tempo d'une autoroute
Te lance une épreuve
Tu m'aimes au goutte-à-goutte
Quand le lit est calme
Voilà que tout se décale
Accélère, je t'en prie, accélère
Dans toutes les impasses oû tu n'emmènes
L'eau me monte aux yeux, je respire à peine
Un déluge qui me poursuit et m'entraîne
Plus vite ... Who oh oh
Au beau du milieu du silence une alarme
Le ciment s'effrite le long des macadams
Mon corps est à cran
Je balance un cri
Mes remparts te cèdent, te saignent, te retiennent
La vie comme un fleuve
Au tempo d'une autoroute
Qui fond goute après goutte
Le temps nous inonde
Les larmes s'emparent de nos songes
Accélèrent, je t'en prie, accélèrent
Dans toutes les impasses oû tu n'emmènes
L'eau me monte aux yeux, je respire à peine
Un déluge qui me poursuit et m'entraîne
Plus vite ... Who oh oh

Les pleurs du chat sauvage au petit jour?
Entends-tu chanter les esprits de la montagne?
Peux-tu peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent?

Now don't call me judgmental, I don't usually complain,
Come on guys, just realize, some things go without saying.

Well, one wore socks with sandals, and the other still had braces,
One guy had a mullet, and one the cops were chasing
When I finally had a date with what seemed to be a real man
He rolled up to my place in a mini van.

Oh why are all the good men gay or taken, feels like I just cant catch a
Break
I don't need a millionaire and I don't need Johnny Depp
Just a man who isnt wanted by the state.
Do I just attract too many loners? or my standards just set way too high?

Jenn Johnson,"The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
The lamb has overcome

If there are words for Him, then I don't have them.
You see my brain has not yet reached the point.
Where it could form a thought that could adequately
describe the greatness of my God
And my lungs have not yet developed the ability to,
release a breathe with enough to agility to
breathe out the greatness of His love
And my voice, you see my voice is so inhibited
Restrained by human limits,
that's hard to even send the praise up
You see if there are words for Him,
I don't have them
My God, His grace is remarkable
Mercies are innumerable
Strength is impenetrable
He is honorable, accountable
Favorable, He's unsearchable yet knowable
Indefinable yet approachable
Indescribable yet personal
He is beyond comprehension
Further than imagination
Constant through generations
King of every nation
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
You see my words are few
In trying to capture the one true God
Using my vocabulary would never do
But I use words as an expression,
An expression of worship to a Savior
A Savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise
So I use words
My heart extols the Lord. Blesses His name forever.
He has won my heart, Captured my mind
And has bond them both together
He is defeated me in my rebellion
Conquered me in my sin
He has welcomed me into His presence
Completely invited me in
He has made Himself the object of my sight
Flooding me with mercies in the morning
Drowning me with grace in the night
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
But what I do have is, good news
For my God knew that manmade words
Would never do, the words are just tools
That we use to point to the truth
So He sent His son Jesus Christ
As The Word, living proof
He is the image of the invisible God
The first born of all creation
For by Him all things were created
Giving nothingness formation
And by His words He sustains
In the power of His name
For He is before all things
And over all things He reigns
Holy is His name
So praise Him for His life
The way he preserved in strife
The humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice
Praise Him for His death (pause)
That He willingly stood in our place
That He lovingly endured the grave
That He battled our enemy
And on the third day rose in Victory
He is everything that was promised
Praised as the risen King
Lift your voice and sing
For one day He will return for us
And we will finally be united with our Savior
For eternity, eternity
So it's not just words that I proclaim
For my words point to The Word
And The Word has a name
Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
And that name is Jesus Christ
Praise His name forever",Forever (We Sing Hallelujah),2018

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

Yeah
She gotta work out a play 'fore
She bail on her day job 'cause bae got
New orders to wait on
New Yorkers and ASOS
Spent years on her plans to ditch a plan
One spark went inside the avalanche
Whole world out there, she set to span
You can tell that by the Instagram
You gonna run the world someday
But someday can wait, it's not today

First sight, it works like a charm
New thing, she probably won't do that

Hardly has time besides that
And the cocktails take her mind off the fact
There's a lot going on and she don't wanna deal
Stuck in the middle among all the feels

Don't need to say it, the struggle is real

Oh, oh, oh
I was scared and you held me tight
Oh, ohhh

It was like we were in black and white
As clear as day, as dark as night

And the truth became a lie
Oh, ohhh
There was no longer peace of mind
Just fear of the unknown, and the unkind

And then when he undressed me
And took my body
I was resolute to be fine

Now the soldiers are all on fire
And our hearts, are dead from desire

And when you say it has nothing to do
Nothing to do with you, you're a liar

Make it stronger
