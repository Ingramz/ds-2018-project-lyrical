Zezé Di Camargo & Luciano,"No dia em que eu saí de casa
Minha mãe me disse:
Filho, vem cá!
Passou a mão em meus cabelos
Olhou em meus olhos
Começou falar

Por onde você for eu sigo
Com meu pensamento sempre onde estiver
Em minhas orações eu vou pedir a Deus
Que ilumine os passos seus

Eu sei que ela nunca compreendeu
Os meus motivos de sair de lá
Mas ela sabe que depois que cresce
O filho vira passarinho e quer voar

Eu bem queria continuar ali
Mas o destino quis me contrariar
E o olhar de minha mãe na porta
Eu deixei chorando a me abençoar

A minha mãe naquele dia
Me falou do mundo como ele é
Parece que ela conhecia
Cada pedra que eu iria por o pé
E sempre ao lado do meu pai
Da pequena cidade ela jamais saiu

Ela me disse assim:
Meu filho, vá com Deus
Que esse mundo inteiro é seu

Eu sei que ela nunca compreendeu
Os meus motivos de sair de lá
Mas ela sabe que depois que cresce
O filho vira passarinho e quer voar

Eu bem queria continuar ali
Mas o destino quis me contrariar
E o olhar de minha mãe na porta
Eu deixei chorando a me abençoar

E o olhar de minha mãe na porta
Eu deixei chorando a me abençoar
E o olhar de minha mãe na porta
Eu deixei chorando a me abençoar",No Dia Em Que Saí De Casa,2009
Zezé Di Camargo & Luciano,"Queria tanto te dizer que eu já não te amo
Que seu amor em minha vida foi mais um engano
Até quando tenho que fingir?
Se a minha boca morre de vontade do seu beijo

Queria esquecer você apenas um momento
Mas nunca consegui tirar você do pensamento
Quando eu digo que não devo te amar
O meu coração me diz te quero e não tem jeito

Eu sempre fiz de tudo pra me apaixonar
Até um dia alguém deixar saudade no meu peito
Agora eu tenho medo
Agora eu tenho medo

Você chegou, me deixou sem saída
Me fez te querer quando eu não mais queria
Você me fez amar quando eu dizia não
E acreditar que no seu coração,
Tinha o grande amor que eu sonhei um dia

Você chegou quando a dor mais doía
E me encontrou quando eu me perdia
Acho que foi Deus que te mandou pra mim
Pra recomeçar e me fazer feliz, por toda a vida

Eu sempre fiz de tudo pra me apaixonar
Até um dia alguém deixar saudade no meu peito
Agora eu tenho medo
Agora eu tenho medo

Zezé Di Camargo & Luciano,"Pra que fingir que sofre
Eu sei que não
No fundo você gosta de me tirar a paz
Se faz inocente
Mais tudo bem
Te quero do meu lado
Porque eu sei

Não tem sentido
Viver sem teu amor
Sempre te levo
Comigo aonde eu vou

Sempre que eu respiro e por você
E te amar me faz sofrer
Baby hoje eu vivo sufocado
Em minha dor
Sempre que eu tento te esquecer
Fico louco pra te ver
Baby não consigo me livrar de tanto amor

Você me deixa triste
O que fazer
Se a solidão insiste
Em me fazer lembrar
Não preciso de mais nada
De mais ninguém
Se você está comigo
Tá tudo bem

Não tem sentido
Viver sem teu amor
Sempre te levo
Comigo aonde eu vou

Sempre que eu respiro e por você
E te amar me faz sofrer
Baby hoje eu vivo sufocado
Em minha dor
Sempre que eu tento te esquecer
Fico louco pra te ver
Baby não consigo me livrar de tanto amor

Isso não é certo
Mais te aceito assim porque
Estou num deserto sem saber pra onde ir
Eu só quero é ser feliz

Sempre que eu respiro e por você
E te amar me faz sofrer
Baby hoje eu vivo sufocado
Em minha dor
Sempre que eu tento te esquecer
Fico louco pra te ver
Baby não consigo me livrar de tanto amor

Baby hoje eu vivo sufocado em minha dor

Zezé Di Camargo & Luciano,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin

Me cobrir depois da tempestade
No girar de um carrossel de um parque
No embarque, na garupa de qualquer saudade

Venha linda como a claridade
De um sol brotando no canteiro
Parecendo a própria flor da idade
Na metade do que foi o nosso amor primeiro

Oh butterfly, oh my butterfly
Diga que não vai dessa vez voar de mim
Vem estrelar lua da manhã, céu de flamboyant

Zezé Di Camargo & Luciano,"Foi amor eu sei
Quando a gente se encontrou pela primeira vez
Foi total encanto
Sem espanto, sem motivos pra se duvidar

Meus olhos nos seus
Uma fogueira foi queimando por dentro de mim
Me tirando o ar
Senti a minha pele inteira arrepiar

Encontrei minha metade
Me despi nessa vontade
Tive que me entregar

Você veio feito um anjo
Foi ficando em minha vida sem me pedir nada
Como se fosse uma prece
Foi tomando minha alma já tão machucada

Isso é bom demais
Você só me faz
Feliz

Tantos sonhos pra viver
Confesso nunca vi tanta cumplicidade
Só um dia sem te ver
Pra mim é como se fosse uma eternidade

Com um manjar de beijos matou minha fome
Com lençol de abraços me aqueceu do frio

Que brinca de anjo para salvar minh'alma

E eu converso e canto pela sua voz

Que faz falta aos outros, o que sobra em nós

Sem você em meu próprio quarto me encontro perdido

No outro dia temporal
E os ventos das brigas não vão desatar nossos laços

Será que já posso dizer que te amo ou que é cedo demais

Coincidimos sin pensar en tiempo y en lugar 

Algo mágico pasó, tu sonrisa me atrapó 
Sin permiso me robaste el corazón 
Y así sin decirnos nada con una simple mirada comenzaba nuestro amor 

Tú me cambiaste la vida desde que llegaste a mi 
Eres el sol que ilumina todo mi existir 
Eres un sueño perfecto, todo lo encuentro en ti 

Tú me cambiaste la vida por ti es que he vuelto a creer 
Ahora sólo tus labios encienden mi piel 
Hoy ya no hay dudas que aquí, el miedo se fue de mí 
Y todo gracias a ti 

Tan hermosa eres por fuera como nadie en la tierra 
Y en tu interior habita la nobleza y la bondad 
Hoy la palabra amor tiene otra dimensión 
Día y noche pido al cielo por los dos 
Ahora todo es tan claro es a ti a quien yo amo
Me devolviste la ilusión

That's all I've had the chance to know 


1 - I want this to be more

More than just a gentle kiss 

More than just a temporary thing 


I want this to be 

More than just a feeling 

More than all our hearts can bring 

More than just a temporary thing 


Look at all these wasted years 

That left me with nothing, nothing more than tears 


I want this to be more 

Than just a passing phase 

My mind can easily erase 

More than just a temporary thing

With no responsibility 

More than just a temporary thing 


I want this to be more 

Than just a temporary thing 

I want this to be more 

Than just a perfect love affair

Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin', you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me boss
I got a hard head, but her heart soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million, told her ""plank on it""

And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose, just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
Oh, I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm messed up
Sure know how to pick 'em
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy
I've had enough convo for Twenty-four
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like go-go, aye
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not, why not, why not, why not, why not?

Zhu,"Life is all about you and not at all about you
Now, that's two opposing thoughts and yet both of them are true
How can you experience everything you choose to do
While observing the experience you're having from a higher view
See, it's the question, not the answer, that's the higher view
Otherwise, you couldn't differentiate between the two
Awareness? But of who?
You think you hurt me, but I promise I was letting you
They say we're all one, but where have we been headed to
I'd rather die free than have to live inside a petting zoo
I am the journey that I'm getting to

I could be it all, I'll make a good life
Let me lose my mind, it's the only way to love
Only way to, only way to love
I could be it all, I'll make a good life
Let me lose my mind, it's the only way to love
Only way to, only way to love

Gratitude is my destination
My destiny is perfectly aligned with this location
I am the map, so I travel back in time
I have everything I want cause my imagination is mine
But mind is not enough for me cause I am not my mind
I could see it all, but never get to see I'm truly blind
I could be it all, but all identities intertwine
The moon is only bright cause it reflects the sun's shine

I could be it all, I'll make a good life
Let me lose my mind, it's the only way to love
Only way to, only way to love

Verse 1:
Sekebun cinta nan berbunga
Teguh berdiri nan berduri
Aku yang asli di dalam mekar
Bila terbit mentari
Menguntumlah
Verse 2:
Sejambang cinta nan berbunga
Megah berdiri nan tiada
Mekar yang kukuh
Bau dan kaku
Itulah pilihanku
Aku di taman hanya perhiasan
Mata ungu..
Chorus :
Hanya mampu ku melihat
Kecurangan warna bunga
Idamanmu berbaja tiada
Sedang aku anggapanmu
Menyusahkan untuk meraih impian
Terlontar ku di halaman
Pemusnah ku adalah kumbang
Runtuh bila ku kelayuan
Impianmu hanyalah masa
Untuk menikmati segala
Belum pasti dirimu bahgia
Verse 3 :
Walaupun aku dipersia
Dari kaca perhiasanmu
Kanku mengorak kuntuman bunga
Seluruh taman ini
Moga matamu bila kejauhan
Terserlahlah

Dalam rindu kugenggami warkah

Tercoret kata memilukan aku
Membacanya dalam gementar
Antara kita tiada bahgia

Meniti hari-hari
Tiada persamaan
Mengapa kita teruskan

Walau dirintang segala derita
Untukmu kekasih kanku korbankan

Satu langkah menjejak asmara
Lena dalam dakapan lara..

Bisik-bisik bukan itu yang diduga
Telah lama terpendam bukan rahsia
Satu detik yang hadir di dalam masa
Satu ruang yang indah untuk kita bersama..
Pastikan datang lagi

Di dalam satu memori
Cuba mendengar seolah memanggil

Dihiasi langit malam
Dan bintang sepi

Apalah lagi yang engkau mahukan
Apalah lagi daya ku korbankan
Ada kehambaran cubaku elakkan
Tiada senyum aku girangkan
Segalanya hilang cuba kutahan

Kerana setia terhadapmu
Telah dibuang ketepi
Kerana janjimu dan sumpahmu

Seandainya dapat kau selam
Sambil mentafsir tasik hatiku
Cuma tenang di permukaan
Dan di dasarnya bergelora..
Persoalan demi persoalan
Membelenggu akal dan fikiran
Tidak ku temu jawapan
Seandainya dapat kulari
Jauh kupergi membawa diri
Sebenarnya langkah terkunci
Antara kasih dan juga budi
Chorus :
Mengapa kau juga yang kurindu
Walau sudah kutahu
Payah bersatu hidup denganmu
Engkau sungguh jujur dan ikhlas
Terhadapku..
Tak pernah walau dalam sekalipun
Kau minta ku membalas
Semuanya itu lambang kesetiaanmu
Bukannya mengaburi mata ini
Atau sebaliknya..
Chorus :
Kita bagaikan pertaruhan
Pada yang menyaksikan jauh manakah
Kita bertahan..
Jika ku tersilap pastinya..
Dipandang hina
Terlalu banyak sungguh halangan
Terpaksa ku terjang
Akupun tidak tahu
Apa yang ingin Tuhan tunjukkan
Adakah ini dugaannya
Hanyalah sekadar untuk menguji
Setiamu....
Seandainya hajat tak sampai
Tanah dan badan pasti berkecai
Terkubur harapan di liang cinta
Kasih ini kita semadikan..

E Roma è sempre Roma

Danzano a braccetto con quelli del futuro
Tu lo chiami la stanza della mente
Dammi retta, non entrare
Lo sai che hai paura
Le voci, non le senti le voci?
Si confondono col rumore della pioggia che batte sui vetri
Sono le voci delle parole che non hai mai detto
A tuo padre, a un amico
A uno stronzo sul treno
A lei che se n'è andata quella sera d'inverno
E non è tornata più
Le parole che non sei riuscito a dire
Le hai chiuse li dentro

E ora saltano, rimbombano, gridano, sbraitano, si spingono
Ballano isteriche sulle note di una musica da baccanale che ti scoppia nel cervello
E tu vorresti uralrle, vomitarle fuori come si fa con qualcosa
Che ti aggroviglia lo stomaco
Come se le avessi tenute dentro per troppo in quella maledetta stanza segreta nella mente
Adesso calmati
Rilassati
Respira
Resta sdraiato
Galleggia sul letto e ascolta il rumore della pioggia
Ogni volta è così, lo sai
Ascolta le gocce
Guarda, sembra che ti parlino
Sembra, si
Sembra

La voce di tua madre che veniva a baciarti prima di dormire
Te lo ricordi?
Quante cose non hai detto a tua madre
Quanti abbracci che sono rimasti chiusi nella stanza
Eh ma adesso è tardi
Ora non c'è più tempo
Senti già i passi
L'assassino è nella strada
Ora è troppo tardi, è qui dentro
Lo senti arrivare
Silenzioso come un serpente striscia inesorabile
Tra i ricordi, le immagini e i flash nella tua mente
Ho detto stai calmo!
Respira, tranquillo
È facile
È tutto molto semplice
Chiudi la porta, ricordi?
Come quando da piccolo
Chiudevi la cameretta dei giochi per paura che l'uomo nero
Uscisse e ti venisse a prendere
Chiudi ancora una volta la stanza delle voci e tutto andrà bene
Nessuna più angoscia
Più nessun rimorso
Tutto va bene ora
Respira

Le ginocchia piene di sangue facevan male
Le ingiustizie avevano il gusto del sapone
E poi verso il mare per riposare pure dall'arte

Le mogli inchiodano I musicisti lasciati al sole
Perle di fiume raccolte solo per far collane
Strumenti chiusi dimenticati nelle cantine
E nonostante tutto la musica sa dove andare

E muoviti svelto che passerà un treno senza fermare
Scrivi sempre per dire che sei arrivato e ricordati dove volevi andare
Grazie alle donne a quelli che ascoltano e alle pellicole da mattatoio
Le sere di inverno alle case di cura e alle fredde tramontane

Strade di cambi per una sera a parlar di segni
Mostri finali con nella testa di farci fuori
Taglierò il prato di tutti I vicini per fare un favore
Chiedendo in cambio soltanto una storia che faccia dormire

E vuoti che sembrano da riempire nei mesi di gelo
E dopo la quiete si dice tempesta tu torna a dormire
Ti mancheranno le nostre giornate a contar le monete
Per un vestito e un capodanno passato comunque a pensare

E muoviti svelto che passerà un treno senza fermare

Se sapessi scrivere davvero lo farei
Invece sto in un angolo e nemmeno ad ascoltare

Non puoi scappare dalla tua ombra
Al massimo, puoi portarla in un’altra città

Zic,"Era un capodanno come tanti 
Amici musica 
Tanti sorrisi, ma anche tanti dubbi di ragazzi feriti da un mondo troppo serio 
Ma eravamo tutti insieme e per una sera, contava solo questo 
Fu lì fra quei sorrisi e quelle battute che la conobbi per la prima volta 

Era la ragazza di uno di quelli che di lì a poco 
Sarebbe diventato un mio grande amico 
Prima di parlare con lei l’ho osservata tanto
Ballava da sola 

Giovanni aveva messo Boombastic 
E lei non faceva altro che girare su se stessa 
Con gli occhi chiusi e le braccia in alto 
Per almeno mezz’ora siamo stati soli in quella stanza 

Non credo sia vero ma
Mi è sempre piaciuto pensare che lo stesse facendo per me 

Ma era evidente che tutti e due, avevamo qualcosa da dirci 
Aveva i capelli corti di un biondo che era finto 
Indossava un vestito blu notte che le scopriva la schiena 
Delle calze a rete e un paio di Dottor Martens neri col tacco 

Aveva lo sguardo innocente e dolce di una bimba 
Ma si muoveva come una donna 
Capii subito di essere innamorato di lei, completamente cotto 

Fu come incontrare il proprio destino
E non sapere che dire ma invece inaspettatamente fu lei a parlare 
Si sedette accanto a me, e mi chiese chi fossi 

Io le risposi, visibilmente imbarazzato 
Che ero amico di Tommaso, arrossii 
Del resto confesso che il rispetto che nutro per le donne è pari al timore che ho per loro 

Poi, piano piano mi sono sciolto 
Fra che lei era una gran chiacchierona, ed un paio di canne
Abbiamo cominciato a parlare di qualsiasi cosa
Della scuola, di musica, della nostra vita 

Ma era evidente che tutti e due avevamo qualcosa da nascondere
La serata passava liscia come l’olio
Nonostante le ore se ne andassero come nuvole 
In un giorno di vento bastardo 
Non riuscivamo a stancarci l’una dell’altro 

A un certo punto mi disse se mi andava di bere un po’ io in quel periodo non bevevo affatto
Ma credo che se quella sera mi avesse chiesto
Di mettermi nudo a quattro zampe 
E di leccare il pavimento non ci avrei pensato due volte
Perciò l’ho seguita in cucina 

Ci siamo fatti un paio di whisky e cola, forse qualcosa di più 
E fu lì che capii che quando si trattava di bere 
Poteva battere chiunque 

Ma era evidente che tutti e due avevamo qualcuno da tradire 
Me la ricordo seduta sul letto
Sul letto con la schiena appoggiata alla parete

Ero sdraiato la testa sulle gambe, ricordo, potevo sentire il suo odore
Mi accarezzava i capelli e mi parlava
Come si parla a un bambino da addormentare

Ma era evidente che tutti e due, avevamo qualcosa da nascondere 
Mi diceva ""sei bravo Lore, sei bello, ti voglio bene, ti voglio bene""
E sopraffatto da un calore e una felicità, che non sapevo esistesse 
Mi addormentai così e quella rimarrà
Certamente la notte più bella della mia vita",Capodanno,

To my one and only

Through other things that I walk through on a daily 
Girl you're my rainbow on my cloudy days

If this world afflicted, you wanna feel gifted 
Pass me with an angel from the heavens above 
You we're to catch me when I fell in love

I like club hits but a slow jams major 
To get my lady movin in that special way 
To make up for the times that I've been gone away

Just made things better 
So listen up girl when you sittin alone 
Hit your local DJ and request that song 
It reminds you of me when I'm not around 
Your boy got love and I'm always down 
I know you gonna kick it when we all alone 
You turnin off my 2 way on my cellular phone 
You want me for yourself and I understand 
But I always can't be there so here's a slow jam

So I'm tryin to make it up 
To let her know that I miss her 
My lifestyle when I sick rugged and rough 
I call when I can but still its never enough 
You up all night waitin on my call 
While I'm in the streets tryin to ball

So order you a shot hun that 1-5-1 
Kickin back chillin by candlelight

I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned

So lock the doors and call me yours

And I got a roof in the sky
Wonder why my heart keeps a throbbing, a throbbing

And I got the flames and the mountains
And that treasure's mine if I try
One by one my blessings I'm counting and counting

The fruit on the boughs of the trees
The clouds bringing me rain, the fields giving me grain
Thanks to the Maker for these

And I got a loved one who loves me
Kids to make my cares hurry by
I may not be in heaven but I can't be far away

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' thru the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves wuz made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered thru the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
with sweat,
They're ridin' hard to atch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Something to make my heart beat much faster
What did I long for, I never really knew.
Finding your love, I found my adventure,
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights the star,

And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine.",All the Things You Are,1994

When there ain't no answer from above
When there ain't no one to love
Is just the music

When there ain't nothing to eat

She said why did my children forsake me

She felt like she was dying
Oh ungrateful children
When she was young she was beautiful and strong
The more children se had the more things went wrong
Now she's feeling old and cold
And her heart doesn't feel love anymore

Beautiful Mother Nature
She sat me down and told me to sing her a song
Maybe it would make her feel better
Maybe her children would sing along

And see the wrong we have done
Make amends to mend her heart
She still wouldn't hate none of her children
No matter what cruel things they've done
She'll always be there when her babies are crying
She's a mother a mother you can depend on

She's hoping her children will love her again

Before skyscrapers and chemical plants
When she was all that we had
Before they polluted her sacred land

And her voice sounds like earthquake

Ziggy Marley,"Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great
You know you can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams
Who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake
Who's gonna come around
When you break

I said you can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

You can't go on
Just thinking, that nothing is wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight",Drive,2004

Never let it rest
Till our good be better
And our better best

For they say
It's just not right for me
But what makes me irie
Is if I could get a little piece of tree

And build
One good spliff
Me and my little brothers
We take a ride
Gonna teach them
All the lessons that I have learned in life

But I know that I'll be fine
Just as long as you got me
Something for my mind

Now let me get a rizzla
Little bit a herb
Light a old match
Let me settle my nerves
I gotta feel real high
Just to touch up on these tracks
Several ounces a day as a matter of fact

Now in Jamaica
Where the air is clean
And the buds all glisten with the glowing green
Guaranteed to lift you up
If you know what I mean
Read me loud and clear
Let me hear you scream
Now, you haven't been there
You should go there soon
And pass through the country
Get a touch of the boom
Go back to your shack or your hotel room
Call Mom and Pop says
I'll be home soon
Hanging with the Marleys all afternoon
And I ain't coming home till next May or June

Keep giving me the good vibration
It's giving me that inspiration
And I love that good sensation
Matter of fact
I think I might build myself one

One good spliff
Me and my younger sisters
We take a ride
One good spliff

When you cry my comfort comes

For myself to sell matches on reputation in human form
To suit the image you want portrayed so the people are still enslaved
You can not define what I do not put in a box for you

I go out, get out, get, get out, get out

I of the universe will not be prisoners of your little world
The mind is limitless where time does not exist
We travel far beyond the realms of expectations
And I refuse to be what you expect from me

I go out, get out, get, get out, get out

What you lose to win the price is high to pay
The desire to not be like them to follow the dream of sin
Blessed are the meek and humble spirit of my own

It was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more
And it was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more

Well did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh 
Is not the ending to life fear not of the Anti-Christ

Did you know that I exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear Jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls

Your bodies just a vehicle transporting the soul
It's what's inside people, is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil, every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

[Chorus]

It is told that once this greasy order
Is form it comes into a young man's world
And two of dem is like a soldier
That joins the thunder is a wonder

One's attack is like a blunder
One is luckily a stranger
Dem both was born like Jesus inna manger
So join the thunder that's savin' our world

A vester on his chest and Rastafarian is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got, lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not, do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames, same blood that runs through my veins

Watch for sticks and stones stumbling blocks and piles
Life is one big road miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
And most people don't even smile there's a natural mystic

Blowing in through the air so keep it realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out and it's so loud and clear, 
But most people won't even hear spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

And all the days of your life

From the task master's whip to my brain
Kidnapped, enslaved, raped
And killed by the lynch clan
Again and again

Or the face of a race
Why you don't care about me?

Now, I know you don't care about me
I'm just a nigga walking down the street
The brother did nothing wrong
But now his life is gone
So, I know you don't care about me
Code of silence you say
Yet your actions speak so loud and clear
Diallo's killers going free paid by society
Now I know you don't care about me

Hey-we should be burning and looting,
Believe me, start exchanging 41 for 90
Our ancestors've built this country
And all sticks and whips and kicks and punches
Meanwhile you're living
Like some bird in bunches
Tell me where is the justice
Much less the dances?
My world must know that man is still in darkness

Rapings, torture, kill and maim.
Their injustice remains the same
Killing the people in the Queen's name
No one will get the blame,
And my people keep going down the drain
All these crimes we've come to read,
They'll be written in black history
Crimes of injustice and inhumanity,
Perpretated by society, and my people
Are living in poverty

And treated as a member of the human family,
Whose practices should reveal the
Fundamental right and duty to be humane
In all judgement and action to all humanity

Are Diallo's killers going free?
Paid by society
And I know you don't care about me

No crime he did not do!
And just like him there were others
Who suffered for what they didn't do

It's kinda strange how the same things're happening
Over and over again, over and over again
And they say their constitution's
For the benefit of all
It's all a lie again, it's all a lie again
Tell me when will this injustice change
Tell me when will we stop feeling pain
Just the way we survive
In their eyes it's a crime
You're to blame for all that's bleeding this way
Yes, we know you don't care about we
Yes, we know you don't care about we

Ziggy Talent,"There's a rich Maharajah of Magador 
Who had ten thousand camels and maybe more 
He had rubies and pearls, and the loveliest girls 
But he didn't know how to do the rumba. 
He could afford..... a big reward 
So to his people one day he said: 
Ah ha hahahahahahahahahahah 
Which means... 
Take my rubies and take my pearls 
Take my camels and take my girls 
Rumba lessons are wanted for 
The rich Maharajah of Magador. 
Ah hahahahahahahahah 
So a slick little chick answered, ""That's for me"" 
To the ad he had placed in Variety 
When she saw his expanse, she could tell at a glance 
That he'd never learn how to do the rumba. 
He had his wealth, he had his health 
So he looked in her eyes and said: 
Ah hahahahahahahahahha 
Take my rubies and take my pearls 
Take my camels, I'll keep my girls 
From now on you'll be working for 
The rich Maharajah of Magador. 
Ah hahahahahahahaha 
He was anxious to learn, so she taught him right 
But she taught him the thrill of a moonlight night. 
He discovered the bliss of a half promised kiss 
But he never learned how to do the rumba. 
And on the day...she went away 
You could hear all the people say: 
She took his rubies and took his pearls 
Took his camels and all his girls 
Took his money and what is more 
She made the rich Maharajah the poor Maharajah of Magador. 
Ah hahahahahahahah

Are you gonna apologize?
About the same thing
And how many times

Can I take you back?
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong
I thought maybe If I started praying

When I would pray, the answer would always come
Back to me, being done

That I would make some changes
But the more I change
There's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me

And everytime that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I've gotta move on now

Its not the fact
That I don't love you no more
But I've got to break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
I'm learning new ways to live
While you're in a comfort zone

Not even thinkin (gotta think about me)
To call me when I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinkin its gonna solve every issue

From the girl callin my phone
To the pictures that I saw
And everytime you would break up with me
For nothing at all
I've taken all I can take

A king with the coolest crown
Stronger than a superman
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound

Try and be everything to everyone, but I 
Know better 
Cause you're the only one I need to please 
That really matters
There are days I feel the need

For something more to feel complete

To win every superbowl
Another feather in my hat

You can count as high as you could ever go

With ten billion Zero's

Who invented you,
They counted on their fingers and toes
(And maybe some sticks and stones, rocks and bones, and neighbor's
Toes!)

How wonderful you are,
Why you could never reach a star
Without you, Zero, my Hero, how wonderful you are

If ya place a Zero after any number, that number goes by ten
(see how easy that is!)
If ya place two Zero's after any number, and that number goes by a
Hundred

With church, maybe you place six Zero's after a number,
And I guess you're goin' flat on the floor!

Zim Zemarel,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1976
Zim Zemarel,"I was born from love
And my poor mother worked the mines
I was raised on the Good Book Jesus
Till I read between the lines
Now I don't believe
I want to see the morning
Going down the Stoney End
I never wanted to go
Down the Stoney End
Mama let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
I can still remember him
With love light in his eyes
But the light flickered out and parted
As the sun began to rise
Now I don't believe
I want to see the morning
Going down the Stoney End
I never wanted to go
Down the Stoney End
Mama let me start all over
Cradle me, mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, mama, cradle me again
Mama, cradle me again...)
Never mind the forecast
'Cause the sky has lost control
'Cause the furry and the broken thunders
Come to match my raging soul
Now I don't believe
I want to see the morning
Going down the Stoney End
I never wanted to go

Mama let me start all over
Cradle me, mama, cradle me again

Zim Zemarel & His Orchestra,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still,1984

To the place where Louie dwells
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well

And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass and be forgotten with the rest

We're poor little lambs who have lost our way

We started in a parking lot and finish at my teniment
Shorty had a reason, my pippin was legitimate
I tore that pussy up like a ligament
She don't like her man so she asked me for deliverance
I sit back with my ray bans on, I say it ain't my fault that you in that predicament

Dale una oportunidad a este amor
Que creo que me lo merezco
Te fui sincero
Ven, why luchemos por este amor
No quiero mirar atras

Todavia creo en la felicidad
Ven, mi yal

Esta separacion me esta comiendo por dentro
Intenso, por mas que pase el tiempo
Yo no puedo negar que te quiero
Es lo que siento, no te miento
Que regreses a mi es mi anhelo
Que recapacites es lo que quiero
Avanza, que me desespero...
Que sabes que por ti me muero...
Why por eso...

Zion,"Ella me dice que va a engatusarme 
Que de mi tiene hambre y yo loco por darle 
Ella me dice que va a engatusarme 
Que de mi tiene hambre y que pa’ luego es tarde, vamo a darle 

Entro a la disco, todo el mundo pagándome 
Llego a la barra y me voy manifestando 
El VIP completo se está refrescando 
To’ el mundo perreando, to’ el mundo sudando 

Yo en el perreo me encuentro una mami 
Que dice que tiene una sorpresita pa’ mí 
Me subió la nota imaginando cuál será 
No pensé mucho y me la llevé por la parte de atrás 

La gente se pregunta qué demonios está pasando 
Las botellas del momento se están acabando 
Pero al vernos a nosotros saben lo que está pasando 
Sencillo, ando con Zion formulando y facturando 

Ella me dice (pum pum papi papi te voa’ engatusar)

Arcángel y Zion, la factoría del flow

Entre todas las que he visto eres la más violenta 

Y let’s go, date un buchecito, mi amor 
Saboréalo al ritmo del alcohol 
Baby, you know que yo tengo la química 
Que te pone sínica aunque estés tímida 

Somos La Fórmula saboreando la cima 
Par de millones envueltos, si quieres pregúntale a Pina 
Mami, hazlo, ven y gánate tu orgasmo 
Janguea con los que son, no te quiero como un asno 

Burro, yo sí que a la muerte me le escurro 
En vez de hacerlo solito en un solo turno 
Okay, por eso yo me siento bien 
Mami, las pacas de uno se parecen a las de cien 

Se me hace muy fácil gastarla 
Como si no hubiera sido muy fácil ganarla 
Seguimos duro y la cuesta en crecimiento

Huéleme bien que tengo olores fascinantes 
Botellas en el VIP, es impresionante 
Ando con el corillo que le gusta frontear 
Y a la misma vez gastar, La Fórmula

Terminar con esto que tanto duele 
Tu me heristes muy cruel 
Pero como ves, la soledad te ataca why quieres volver 
Hoy no creo en tu amor, ya dejame 
Que en tu juego no voy a caer 

Es mejor dejarnos why ya no mas buscarnos 
Deja de estar llamando porque ya no quiero intentarlo

En mi vida ya no vas a entrar 
Perdistes la oportunidad 
Perdistes se te hizo tarde 
El tiempo no aprovechastes 
Todavia estas en el aire 
Lo nuestro se arruino, no trates de arreglarlo 
El amor que te di no supistes valorizarlo 
Perdistes se te hizo tarde 
El tiempo no aprovechastes 
Todavia estas en el aire 
Ya se acabo el amor, ya no hay solucion ( yeahhh)

Ya dejame, de mi vida alejate ( yo te lo ruego)

Que me volvía loco y al besarla
Se iluminaba aquel rincón oscuro

No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo (se van)
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos (se van)
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de quitar el seguro
Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de playe'? 
Cuando no había radio, vídeo ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como jack the ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en bet, trl por mtv, ¡please!

El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío

Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes ok
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su brutality
Ustedes to's me pagan royalties
Tanto leido no me hablen de loyalty
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi versatility
Y no pueden con mi productivity
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una opportunity
Pues, compárense con mis capacity
Sigan mascando lo que luny hace, el beat
Y don te batea un hit

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero
Papi, yo soy el favorito de los pirateros
Yo soy aquel que te mata

El favorito de tu gatas de los dones dilato en mi
El mas que suena en las ""scooter"" y las motoritas

No quiero que me traigas flores
Buena suerte y no se me ahoge
Que esta diva es de las mejores

¿Quién es? El que te pone a vibrar
¿Quién es? El que te pone a pensar
¿Quién es? Al que tú quieres besar
¿Quién es? The one and only, Daddy

Ma', ya tu vez, todo termino
Fue una estupidez nuestra relación
Yo ya te olvide, no me llames, no
Uno se aburre de este novelón

¿Y qué pasó? Ahora tengo un par de ladies
Que me dicen, ""Baby, montame en el Bentley""
¿Y qué pasó? Y aunque tengas otro hombre
Yo te apuesto que nunca olvidaras mi nombre

Con, ""Calmona"", rompo zona
Y voy devorando to' las gatas que veo solas
Me voy de party, llego a mi casa
Ma', a cualquier hora
Vive tu vida, que yo la mía
No la cambio por na' ahora

¿Quién es? El que te pone a vibrar
¿Quién es? El que te pone a pensar
¿Quién es? Al que tú quieres besar
¿Quién es? The boss, Daddy

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar

¡Arcangel pa!
Ella se cree que voy a llorar
¡Mala mia ma, mala mia ma!

Otra mas buena me voy a buscar
Que me ayude mis penas olvidar
Ella se cree que voy a llorar
¡Mala mia ma, mala mia ma!

Otra mas buena me voy a buscar
Que me ayude mis penas olvidar
Gracias a dios estoy mejor
Y poco a poco te olvido

Gracias a dios le doy por salirte de mi camino
La maldad fueron las cosas que me trajo el destino
Y no quiero vivir lo que en el pasado e vivido
Ahora me siento bien porque no estoy contigo

Perdoname Señor si la Maldigo
Pero soy un hombre valiente
Y de temple fuerte de lo unico que me arrepiento
Fue de conocerte

De la guetto le gana enamorando la ganas
Las gorditas las flakas las finas arcangel las sanas
Las que perrean descalzas

Y nunka se cansan
Cuando se trata del amor
Se te unde la tanga
Son los tiempos de antes

El amor no es lo mismo
Los tiempos de carrusel
Los tiempos de los besitos
El amor de colegio, el amor prohibido

Esta vez me presento yo
¡Mala mia ma, mala mia ma!
!Randy!

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No me llores
Corre mala gente

Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No quiero que llores por mi
Ay, no conmigo tu no va a jugar
No me llores

Corre mala gente

Relax, suave, acariciame a Petete

¿Y ahora quién te va a guayar la cola?

Zion,"Hello, yo soy aquel 
Que anoche en la discoteca estuvo contigo 
Yo soy aquel que bien supo amarte 
Yo soy el que con besos
Supo seducirte pero no te obligo
Fue por par de copas que te entregaste

Hicimos el amor hasta el amanecer
Pensando que no nos volveríamos a ver
Oh, y no lo puedo entender, hello
Que quiero volverte a ver
Bailemos pega'o, tú y yo, abraza'o 
Bailemos pega'o, tú y yo, apreta'o 
Bailemos pega'o, oh, jura'o 
Señora, para mi es un honor haberla encontra'o 

Anoche envueltos usted y yo
En una cama la escuche
Amándola como yo solo sé
Me hice dueño de su piel
Y viéndola desnuda, juro
Que me volvía loco y al besarla
Se iluminaba aquel rincón oscuro
Y yo, sin pensarlo, comencé a amarla
Me hice dueño de sus ganas
Me hice dueño de su cuerpo
Cayendo en la cama, haciéndolo lento

Zion,"Damas y caballeros!
Bienvenidos a otro capitulo!
De la historia del reggaeton!
""Los Benjamins""!
Nosotros somos el dream team

Socio, ando con la calle velando
No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡Se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo (se van)
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos (se van)
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de quitar el seguro
Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro
Solo hay un intento

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de Playe'?
Cuando no había radio, vídeo ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como Jack the Ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en BET, TRL por MTV, ¡please!
Pa' acá tu no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones:
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en tus canciones
Sigo subiendo everyday
El pasado, presente y futuro way
Si esto fuera la NBA
Fuera Dr. J, Jordan y Lebron James

Abran pasa al ministro, yo suministro
Yo controlo las calles y los gistros
El profesor moreno controlando la carretera
Postea'o en la escalera
Con la burra te tabaco y madera
El enviado con moño y que anda aborrecido
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de Caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""Agua!""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el Cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes OK
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su ""brutality""
Ustedes to's me pagan ""royalties""
Tanto leido no me hablen de ""loyalty""
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi ""versatility""
Y no pueden con mi ""productivity""
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una ""opportunity""
Pues, compárense con mis ""capacity""
Sigan mascando lo que Luny hace, el ""beat""
Y Don te batea un ""hit""

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, ""enemy""
Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, ""enemy""

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero
Papi, yo soy el favorito de los pirateros
Yo soy aquel que te mata
Pa' hablar claro, papi
El favorito de tu gatas de los dones dilato en mi
El mas que suena en las ""scooter"" y las motoritas
(¡Arcángel, pa'!)
(¡No te copies, papi!)

Hoy mi peine caracol se va de gira
Hasta que no tumbe un par pa' atrás no vira
Mi pana, coja la orilla, póngase las zapatillas
Porque hoy vas a correr mas de una milla
(¿Quién es?) sube ""A"", gorra ""A""
Cadena crornada con la ""A""
Soy yo, criminal-criminal
Yo no protesto, mucho menos me molesto
Al que me tire le contesto

Es mejor decir adios, no volvernos a ver 
Terminar con esto que tanto duele 
Tu me heristes muy cruel 
Pero como ves, la soledad te ataca why quieres volver 
Hoy no creo en tu amor, ya dejame 
Que en tu juego no voy a caer 

Es mejor dejarnos why ya no mas buscarnos 
Deja de estar llamando porque ya no quiero intentarlo 
Es mejor dejarnos why ya no mas buscarnos 
Deja de estar llamando porque ya no quiero intentarlo.....

Es mejor no volver atras 
Mami no inventes 
No te vistas que no vas 
En mi vida ya no vas a entrar 
Perdistes la oportunidad 
Perdistes se te hizo tarde 
El tiempo no aprovechastes 
Todavia estas en el aire 
Lo nuestro se arruino, no trates de arreglarlo 
El amor que te di no supistes valorizarlo 
Perdistes se te hizo tarde 
El tiempo no aprovechastes 
Todavia estas en el aire 
Ya se acabo el amor, ya no hay solucion ( yeahhh) 
(Ya no hay solucion?) 


Ya dejame, de mi vida alejate ( yo te lo ruego) 
Te lo dije una vez, van 2 why van 3 ( no voy a caer en tu juego? 
Yo te soy sincero)

See the mind up in the drains
All the way that we dance
All I really know
It's tonight, I want your hand

Se que te voy a hacer el amor

Zion,"Dejame explicar, 
Dame un minuto para hablarte, 
Ella no es mi amante,no, 
Tan solo vino a visitarme, 
Tu fuiste una cobarde,no, 
No basilastes en dejar, 
No te dolio abandonar. 

Y se me hizo incomoda mi cama, 
Y se volvio grande el apartamento, 
Uno se vuelve debil cuando ama y no recibe el mismo sentimiento, 
Y llore, Sobre sus hombros le llore, 
Y uno no es menos hombre cuando llora, 
Y usted no es quien pa reprocharme ahora. 

Tu amor es periodico de ayer, 
No se na y por na, lo quiero si ya pase una nueva pagina, 
Y tuyo fue el foul, 
Ya yo he pagao, 
Con las lagrimas que he derramao, Soliao. (x2) 

Me siento incomodo, 
No creas que me siento bien sabiendo que tu y yo, 
Entregamos todo, 
Jurandonos amor. 

Mas yo no pense, 
No sabia que seria de mi vida sin ti, 
No fue mi fracasado, no, 
Contigo no, 
Yo confie en ti. 

Tu amor es periodico de ayer, 
No se na y por na, lo quiero si ya pase una nueva pagina, 
Y tuyo fue el foul, 
Ya yo he pagao, 
Con las lagrimas que he derramao, Soliao. (x2) 

Ella vino a saber de mi vida, 
Porque sabe que sufro y que mi alma esta herida, 
De momento la noche calló en mi ventana, 
Y nos fuimos dejando llevar por las ganas. 

Ella vino por que estoy sin ti (ooo..). 
Ella vino por que estoy sin ti (eee..). (2x).",Periodico de Ayer,2007
Zion,"Hoy te vas why no me das razon
Como le explico al corazon
Tu me enseÃ±astes a vivir amandote why yo
Nunca aprendi a vivir amor sin tu calor...


Why no te prometo nada pero baby
Voy arrancarte de mi
Que largo se hare el tiempo
Que grande se hare el mundo
Mas grande lo que siento
Mas alto que profundo

Sientate hablemos sin rencores ni secretos
Ya te perdone
Aunque duele mas pensan mas mis sentimientos

El no se espera por ti
Muere por estar con el
Yo no te menti
No te falle
Why se fue al diablo el amor tuyo

dime
Como diablo le hago para olvidarte
Dime
Como duermo a solas cuando mi alma llora tu
Si saves como dime dime

Dime

Si saves como dime dime

El no te amo como yo lo hice
Tu sufriras aun mas que yo 
Siempre pasa mas dolor quien traiciono

why vuela vuela vuela se feliz con el
Why vela vela pagaras tarde o temprano al ver sido infiel
Why vuela vuela vuela se feliz con el
Oohh
Why vela vela pagaras tarde o temprano al ver sido infiel

El no se espera por ti
Muere por estar con el
Yo no te menti

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

She's like Shakira belly dancing on the Grammy Awards
Like Beyonce clapping hard for them the MTV show
She's so amazing, she drives me crazy

Baila, baila, mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadora
Eres bien tentadora, de todas la mas seductora

Baila, baila, mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadora
Eres bien tentadora, de todas la mas seductora

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

For me, is so tempting that I can't deny
For us to be together side by side
La noche esta buena para experimentar
Just me and you together, sin parar

Excuse me, Zion, don't mean to interrupt but she's fire
Way her body jiggling all in her attire
Dropping it down low while she bring it up higher
While we sing it now

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

Shorty so sexy, I wanna take you to my crib
Excuse me, Kon, let me help you out, she don't speak no English
Ella se ve de lo mas de bien quiero sacarte de aqui
Por si no lo sabias esta noche, you're gonna end up with me

Then I can just ride you, you know slip and slide you
Flip you over good lovin' is what I can provide you
If you don't want it, then walk away 'cause it's your right to
But I wanna show you to the world, never hide you

'Cause you're the most beautifulest thing that I ever seen
And you got the potential to blow me up like gasoline
Girl, I'm trying to be patient, trying to be a gentleman
Can you see what you're doing to me?

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

Zion y Lennox
Eco Mueca
Mami
A veces me pongo a pensar en ti
Y lo que me recuerdo son cosas malas 
Y todo el daño que me hiciste 
No te puedo decirte que te deseo lo mejor del mundo

Hoy de nuevo me acuerdo de ti 
Me visita la culpa tu rostro y la vieja pregunta 
Que porque después de tanto me duele mas que nunca?
(Porque me duele tanto)
Cuando pienso en ti, aquellas veces que me hacías sentir 
Como si viajara al mundo contigo
Y aunque me duele en el corazón
(Aunque me duela)
Y me ahogue en un mar de temor
Tratare de vencer el temor
(Y seré el vencedor)
Solo te diré una cosa
(Oye)
Te deseo el mal amor
(Eso es lo que tú te mereces)
Solo te diré una cosa
(Oye) 
Te deseo el mal amor 
Y aunque me duele en el corazón
(Aunque me duela en el alma) 
Y me ahogue en un mar de temor
Tratare de vencer el temor
Solo te diré una cosa 
Te deseo el mal amor 
Solo te diré una cosa
Te deseo el mal amor
(As sido muy mala conmigo) 
El mal amor
(Te deseo lo mismo que me as hecho, lo mismo que me has causado) 
(El príncipe, esto es insomnio, Lennox) 

Navegante en este mar de dolor 
Donde no existe amor, donde reina la desilusión
Mírame estoy muy mal deseo que estés igual 
Para que así tu comprendas el daño que me as causado amor 
?
Estoy agobiado lleno de lamentos
Pasando de lo nuestro que ya esta muerto 
Y gracias a ti ya no creo en el amor 
Yo soy la victima en esta ocasión 
No recuerdo haber sido mal amor 
Esto es extraño, ya no lo aguanto 
Puedo dejarte en este mar de dolor

Un recuerdo que me llega muy dentro de mi corazón navega 
Es como si prendo el motor pero el avión 
Nunca despega
Es como si voy en un tren, sin dirección 
Y sin la vía esperando un chin de agua 
En corazones de sequía
Me conoces 
Y sabes que era loco por mirarte 
Ahora olvidarte como yo 
En pa' cal y vivir en un mundo aparte 
Donde nadie sepa las angustias que yo siento 
Te deseo lo mejor sabiendo que en verdad te miento
Ojala te pasen todas las cosas que a mi me pasaron 
Problemas, depresiones...quizás ya se te olvidaron
Donde quieras que estés quiero que entiendas 
Y sepas que ya e cerrado mi corazón 
Para que mal nunca quepa

Jamás volveré a pensarte, e decidido olvidarte ya 
Borrarte ya
Todos los sacrificios que no sabistes 
Valorizar, que mal te vaya 
Cuando no encuentres alguien 
Que te sepa amar
Hay es que me vas a recordar 
Pero lo siento porque será muy tarde ya 
Cuando no encuentres alguien 
Que te sepa amar
Hay es que me vas a recordar 
Pero lo siento porque será muy tarde ya

Ojala que te enamores de los besos 
Te enamores de las flores 
De un poeta que te vende un mundo 
De cien mil colores
Nunca selles un amor perfecto 
Vivan como reyes 
Para después yo ver como a los dos 
La nave se le estrelle 
Lo profundo, yo mientras mas te odio 
Mas me hundo 
Porque se que por tu culpa 
Yo ando solo en este mundo 
Voy perdido, me han dicho mil rumores 
Al oído, mil enfangues que tú te has tirado 
Y ahora si e sentido lo que hiciste
Yo triste me sentido, como mierda un cero a la izquierda
Y es garantizado que yo te pierda 
Pero, dicen que el amor 
No mezcla con el vino 
Mi may me dice 
José mas alante hay mas vecinos 
Vive gente 
Un amor para cada cual es diferente 
A veces nunca llega pero por lo menos 
Casi siempre cuando te enamores 
Tú debes siempre recordar
Que cada cuento tiene su principio y su final

Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en su cara
El cielo entre sus piernas

Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena
Si quieres te recojo en mi coche
Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

Ella, ella, ella, ella
Tan bella, tan bella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Baje del cielo una estrella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Tan bella, tan bella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Yo soy su príncipe, ella mi doncella

Esta es la noche en la que victorioso saldré
Con ella caí en el juego yes
Será en la suite o en mi casa tal vez
Lo que yo sé es que va a ser hasta tarde
Nena me vuelve loco tu figura sensual
No dures tu cintura cuando rompe al caminar
Intensa en un viaje espacial
Es que está buena pa' bailar, pa' bailar

Una belleza así en cualquier lado no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed
Una belleza asa  en cualquier lado no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed

Desde que te vi al minuto me puse pa' ti
Acepto eres mi obsesión
Te has convertido en mi adicción
Quieres quitarme la vida a mi
Atrevida, eres una bandida
Quién te mando a curarme y a sonsacarme
Vas a tener que dar la liga

Fenomenal one, fenomenal two
Fenomenal noche especial
Fenomenal si te saco a bailar
Fenomenal si dice si
Te dejaras llevar por mi
Porque amanecerá as frente al mar
Consultaría a la oscuridad
Y la luna le pediré
Que si cae linda esta noche
Vaya entonces seamos tres
Yo nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Que juegue con el mar y me haga enloquecer

Nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Con tanto poder que me haga retroceder
Nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Que me lleve a las alturas
Y las estrellas me haga ver

Te conocí esa tarde
Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en tu cara
Y el cielo entre sus piernas
Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena
Si quieres te recojo en mi coche
Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

De confesar los sentimientos 
Que hoy en dia viven y mueren en mi corazon

Enloquecer asi eh eh 
A ver si un dia 
Alguien te va a amar como yo

Consulta con tu corazon aver que te dice 
Que mi amor fue verdadero y no dejo sicatrices 
Nooou 
Yo conosco a mi nena 
Tu puedes provar en otras personas pero ninguno tellena 
Que te aga el amor mejor que yo en la luna llena

Siempre tiene la razón

No quiere saber
De nadie que la quiera a ella joder
Ella solo quiere un hombre que le de
Que le de, bien duro como es
Como es, alguien como yo

Que la parte la noche entera (como yo)
Que le diera todo lo que ella quisiera (como yo)
Que no le pelea, no la jode y no la cela (como yo)
Que la lleve a viajar para donde sea (como yo)

Que la parta la noche entera (como yo)
Que le diera todo lo que ella quisiera (mamcita)
Que lo haga dela forma que sea

No quiere saber, saber de amor
Solo busca placer, calor y sudor
No quiere saber, saber de amor
Ella pide placer, calor y sudor

Está cansada de mentirás
De patanes que le amarguen la vida
Pide que la devoren y que le metan con ira
Hoy no se me escapa, pues la tengo en la mira

Quiere que le de fugo
Que la queme que le conceda sus deseos
Y yo la vaya tirar, se lo voy a dar te
Porque estoy puesto para eso

Quiere que le de fuego
Que la queme, que le conceda sus deseos
Y yo la voy a pillar, se lo voy a dar te
Porque estoy puesto para eso

Que la parte la noche entera (como yo)
Que le diera todo lo que ella quisiera (como yo)
Que no le pelea, no la jode y no la cela (como yo)
Que la lleve a viajar para donde sea (como yo)

Que la parte la noche entera (como yo)
Que le diera todo lo que ella quisiera (como yo)
Que no le pelea, no la jode y no la cela (como yo)
Que la lleve a viajar para donde sea

No le gusta que la celen
Ni que la velen
Anda a fuego en la calle, buscando que se la leven
El marido esta preso, la mai le cuida los nenes
Se pasa con las amigas, jangueando todo los weekeneds

Sube fotos al Instagram en traje de baño a cada hora
Es loca con Michael Kors y las pulseras de Pandora
Me tiene enamorado, yo ya le he tirado con toda

Tu hermoso cuerpo 

Pide candela, somos calientes 
Vamos que esperas esta noche 
Saca lo de arriba pa afuera 
Quiero que se suelte tu fiera 
Te desesperás 

Y entrégate a mí, cinderela 
Tu estas sexy, pero tan bella 
No me imagino la vida sin ella 
Y mucho menos sin poder tenerla 

Hagamos esto realidad 
Confieso que me gustas 
El tiempo nuestro es ya 

Te quiero solita pa' mi 
Pa mí, pa mí 
Te quiero solita pa' mi 
Pa mí, pa mí

Cuando saboreaba esos labios 
Tu cuerpo se estremecía 
Me antojó, como quería 
En esos momento eras mía 
Te lo di todo 

Te quiero sólita para mí, cerquita de mi 
Besarte despacio y decirte, todo lo que siento 
Que tal si nos quedamos aquí, a poder descubrir 
Los secretos de nuestros cuerpos 

Hagamos esto realidad 
Confieso que me gustas 
El tiempo nuestro es ya 

Te quiero solita pa' mi 
Pa mí, pa mí 
Te quiero solita pa' mi 
Pa mí, pa mí

Te quiero solita pa' mi 
Pa mí, pa mí 
Te quiero solita pa' mi 
Pa mí, pa mí

Baby te confieso que a veces me desespero
W, La Z y la L

Solo tú, sabes jugar con mi mente, me conoces perfectamente
Seductora, siempre yo caigo en tu juego
Y yo, deseoso por tenerte
Estoy más que consiente, que los dos estamos jugando con fuego

Porque cuando tú me besas se me olvida, que eres prohibida
Mantengamos el secreto mi bebe
Para vernos otra vez a escondidas, aunque sé que eres prohibida
Vente conmigo y olvídate de él

Baby no quiero testigos, tú me tocas y yo sigo
Que solo somos amigos, pero yo quiero contigo
Tu punto débil lo consigo, no te obligo
Yo solo quiero abrazarte y darte castigo (prendelo)
Él no tiene lo que yo te doy
Ella sabe quién yo soy, el que la pasea en el Rolls Royce
Mi modelo de Playboy, sabe dónde yo estoy
Está lloviendo de seguro llama hoy
El flow italiano, la cartera en la mano
Casi siempre gano cuando me llama temprano
Yo la busco, nadie me ve, todo un veterano
Me besa por el cuello, a mí me encanta como jugamos

Y me ve, en la disco te encontré, tal como te soñé
El sudor en tu piel me dice que quieres ser mía
Y sé, que te encanta que te dé y que te haga mi mujer
Una noche de placer, ya que conmigo no sientes vacío
No sientes vacío
(Baby tú tienes una deuda conmigo)
(Prende)

Olvídate de él (olvídate de el)
Te quiero dar placer (una y otra vez)
Contemplando, disfrutando tu desnudez
Tengo un lugar secreto, donde podemos hacerlo discreto
Hagámoslo duro en el concreto, siempre serás mía lo decreto
Mami no te retractes, esta noche nace por y para darte
Todo lo que quería darte desde antes
Estoy convencido de que amarte es un arte

Y me ve, en la disco te encontré, tal como te soñé

Me levanté de la cama y la rumba me llama
24/7 en busca de una dama
Se me olvida la fama y el trago se derrama
Y sigo guayando y bailando hasta que los pies se me inflaman
Yo sé que tú quieres, yo también quiero
No pongo, pero quiero ser el primero
Si me pides un beso, lo exagero
Tú sabes, el vaquero
El que anda con la cubana y el sombrero

Ahora es que tú te mueves solita, tu cuerpo lo necesita
Ahora es ponte una mano en la cadera
Y en la otra, otra cervecita
¡Qué bien te ves!
No quiero vacaciones, sólo a ti mujer
No necesito más nada

Que grite como tu quiera reggaeton que te quema

En tu mundo de pasión, dañémosno la mente
Déjame acariciar tu cuerpo tan caliente
Déjame sentir tu piel como se siente
Y si te entregas más, más tengo para ti

Rompe todas las ondas y roba el show
Cuando se combina un parcero con la maña de 'boriquizi' 
Hay mucho piquete pa la nena, estamos 'easy' 
Alguien va a pararnos, whoa whoa, difícil
Ninguna se salva cuando cae el 'missile' 

Que le den, que le den, que le den reggaeton  pa' ver lo que pasa
Que le den, que le den, que le den prueba la fiera y te caza
zumba y arrasa, me prende y pasa

Nuevamente te tengo, 
Me acerco y aprovecho el momento

Sexy baila, y me deja con las ganas 

Y yo hoy estoy aquí sediento y loco por tenerte 
Tu boca me llama, me pide que te bese
Tú eres la única que me hace morir de ganas
Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (farru)

Déjate llevar por el boom boom 
Del bajo cuando azota 
Pégate a mi cuerpo
No te hagas la loca y baila 
Tú no eres una santa
Como te gusta el dembow
Y el reggaeton te encanta 

Hay química entre tú y yo 
No miremos bebe el reloj
Si tomas este servidor te invita
Ya yo se lo que tú necesitas

Que bien te queda a ti esa faldita
Ella es señora no es señorita
Sexy baila y me deja con las ganas
Como te luces cuando lo meneas
Cuanto quisiera hacerte el amor
Enséñame lo que sabes

Que la noche no se va a acabar temprano
Siénteme y dame de ese calor humano

Más allá de la ropa
Más allá de besarte en la boca 
Más allá de darnos un par de copas 
Tú haces que me eleve la nota 
En la cama me agotas 
Cuando te mueves así, bailando 
Sigue rozándome así, guayando 
Como te brilla la piel sudando 
Sigue sigue me estás descontrolando

Toa' guilla de lista

Con una faldita cortita y una camisa chiquita

Puedes sacar de mi to' lo malo con una pildorita
Solita se excita

En las piernas lleva fuego, hace que el suelo se derrita
Mandala, que coje vuelo, y esa si que no se quita

Zion,"La conocí una tarde
Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en su cara
El cielo entre sus piernas

Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena
Si quieres te recojo en mi coche
Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

Ella, ella, ella, ella
Tan bella, tan bella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Baje del cielo una estrella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Tan bella, tan bella
Ella, ella, ella, ella
Yo soy su príncipe, ella mi doncella

Esta es la noche en la que victorioso saldré
Con ella caí en el juego yes
Será en la suite o en mi casa tal vez
Lo que yo sé es que va a ser hasta tarde
Nena me vuelve loco tu figura sensual
No dures tu cintura cuando rompe al caminar
Intensa en un viaje espacial
Es que está buena pa' bailar, pa' bailar

Una belleza así en cualquier lado no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed
Una belleza asa  en cualquier lado no se ve
Te voy a dar lo de ella duro sin timidez
Su desnudez me llevo hacia otra parte
Te voy a dar lo de ella hasta saciar la sed

Desde que te vi al minuto me puse pa' ti
Acepto eres mi obsesión
Te has convertido en mi adicción
Quieres quitarme la vida a mi
Atrevida, eres una bandida
Quién te mando a curarme y a sonsacarme
Vas a tener que dar la liga

Fenomenal one, fenomenal two
Fenomenal noche especial
Fenomenal si te saco a bailar
Fenomenal si dice si
Te dejaras llevar por mi
Porque amanecerá as frente al mar
Consultaría a la oscuridad
Y la luna le pediré
Que si cae linda esta noche
Vaya entonces seamos tres
Yo nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Que juegue con el mar y me haga enloquecer

Nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Con tanto poder que me haga retroceder
Nunca vista asa , cintura de mujer
Que me lleve a las alturas
Y las estrellas me haga ver

Te conocí esa tarde
Llena de sol y arena
Una diosa en tu cara
Y el cielo entre sus piernas
Le dije esta noche
Sangra la luna llena
Si quieres te recojo en mi coche
Y te llevo a ver las estrellas

Ella, ella, ella, ella
Yo

Entro a la disco, todo el mundo pagándome 
Llego a la barra y me voy manifestando

To’ el mundo perreando, to’ el mundo sudando 

Yo en el perreo me encuentro una mami 
Que dice que tiene una sorpresita pa’ mí 
Me subió la nota imaginando cuál será 
No pensé mucho y me la llevé por la parte de atrás 

La gente se pregunta qué demonios está pasando 
Las botellas del momento se están acabando 
Pero al vernos a nosotros saben lo que está pasando

Que te pone sínica aunque estés tímida 

Somos La Fórmula saboreando la cima 
Par de millones envueltos, si quieres pregúntale a Pina 
Mami, hazlo, ven y gánate tu orgasmo 
Janguea con los que son, no te quiero como un asno 

Burro, yo sí que a la muerte me le escurro 
En vez de hacerlo solito en un solo turno 
Okay, por eso yo me siento bien 
Mami, las pacas de uno se parecen a las de cien 

Se me hace muy fácil gastarla 
Como si no hubiera sido muy fácil ganarla 
Seguimos duro y la cuesta en crecimiento

Que esa media tuya esta que estilla

Y yo perreándote
La noche entera deseándote

Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá
Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá
Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá
Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá

Tú y yo mirándonos
Deseándonos
Calentándonos

Tú y yo mirándonos
Deseándonos
Calentándonos

La distancia nos separa
Pero yo voy tras de ti
Tu mirada me provoca
Y yo sigo aquí
Esperando el momento
Para que vengas por mí
No tengas miedo que yo voy por ti

Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá
Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá
Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá
Es la cosa vamo' allá
Vamo' allá

Lo que me gusta de ti
Es que tienes mucha disponibilidad
Que cuando quiero hacer algo
Rápido con creatividad
Cuando de rozo mami
Te azoto mami
Me dices a mí

También me gusta de ti
Que cuando salimos a janguiar
Todos los hombres contigo quieren bailar
Los ignoras mami
Te viras a mí
Me repites así

Tú y yo mirándonos
Deseándonos
Calentándonos
Tú y yo mirándonos
Deseándonos
Calentándonos

Cuando yo sé que ha corrio pistas
Toa' guilla de lista

Con una faldita cortita y una camisa chiquita

Puedes sacar de mi to' lo malo con una pildorita
Solita se excita

y va bailando, dando vuelta, haciendo suya toa la pista
En las piernas lleva fuego, hace que el suelo se derrita
Mandala, que coje vuelo, y esa si que no se quita
y por si no lo dije horita, buenas noches señorita

Alocate why hazte mía 
Que la noche lo pidio 
El destino lo decidió 
Ya se que sentías 
Lo mismo que yo why todavía 
Nos queda un ratito para formar el escandalo 
Al menos que no te decidas 

why no, no se si no 
Te sientes al igual que yo 
Dime si no 
Dime si no 
Why no, no se si no 
Quisieras contentar mi cuerpo 
Dime si no

Dale mamita vamono al grano 
No soy fulano 
Entiende why comprende que yo 
Soy el Zion 
Que cuando te canto sigues bailando 
Que mientras te botas sigo gozando 
Me siento me suelto why como vamos 
Si seguimos nos matamos 
No te equivoques tu bien sabes 
Como es el Zion 
Siguete envolviendo 
Que esto esta empezando

Zion,"Hello, yo soy aquel 
Que anoche en la discoteca estuvo contigo 
Yo soy aquel que bien supo amarte 
Yo soy el que con besos
Supo seducirte pero no te obligo
Fue por par de copas que te entregaste

Hicimos el amor hasta el amanecer
Pensando que no nos volveríamos a ver
Ohhh, y no lo puedo entender, hello
Que quiero volverte a ver
Bailemos pega'o, tú y yo, abraza'o 
Bailemos pega'o, tú y yo, apreta'o 
Bailemos pega'o, ohhhhhh, jura'o 
Señora, para mi es un honor haberla encontra'o 

Anoche envueltos usted y yo
En una cama la escuche
Amándola como yo solo sé
Me hice dueño de su piel
y viéndola desnuda, juro
Que me volvía loco y al besarla
Se iluminaba aquel rincón oscuro
y yo, sin pensarlo, comencé a amarla
Me hice dueño de sus ganas
Me hice dueño de su cuerpo
Cayendo en la cama, haciéndolo lento

Las penas olvidando
Mucho ron bebiendo

Tranquila
Que usted no tiene el pecho e tola
Dame una ride

Cambiar de china por botella
Pero tranquilo por que yo no soy de los que celan
Me veras por allá

Cuanto apuesto

A esa avena no le tiro mas canela
Yo sigo en el party botando las suelas
Por que la novela
Es que la parte que tu cuelas
Y yo controlo la manivela
Oye hay que hacer dieta
Te remodelas
Y yo sigo aqui comiendo arroz con habichuelas
Y ya llevo un año sin ella
En el puro jangueo
Ya yo no la veo
Solo ron y bureo

Y si es cuestión de perreo
Perreo dale un paseo
Oye es noche de entierro
Chula siente mi deseo
