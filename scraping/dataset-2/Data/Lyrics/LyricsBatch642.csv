(Summertime and the livin's easy)
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras-MG
All the people in the dance will agree 
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, me and Louie we're gonna run to the party 
And dance till the rhythm it gets harder
Ba da ba bye bye, ba da ba bye bye, I must say
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad but she treats me like shhh
All locked down like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over and when she gets home 
There's none left for me

(Summertime and the livin's easy)
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras-MG
All the people in the dance will agree 
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, me and Louie we're gonna run to the party 
And dance till the rhythm it gets harder

When the music hits you shall feel no pain
Take a spiff of sinsemilla make it run through your brain
Me and Sublime we sound one, the same
Two lions into the jungle that they just can't tame
So bring all your people and bring it, hey
You better take your lovin' and fling it
You better bring your lovin' home, come and love your maximo
24/7 say me can't sink so low

So take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will some day rise
And what am I gonna be doin' for a wife
I said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them now we've come off the shelf

(Summertime and the livin's easy)
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras-MG
All the people in the dance will agree 
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, me and Louie we're gonna run to the party 
And dance till the rhythm it gets harder

Evil, evil, tension, tension
Hold her water

Evil come to tell you that she's evil most definitely
Evil, ornery scandalous and evil most definitely
The tension is getting hotter 
I'd like to hold her head underwater

(Summertime and the livin's easy)
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras-MG
All the people in the dance will agree 
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me and Louie everybody run to the party 
And dance till the rhythm it gets harder

Mad Lion,"Mama she used to say, don't live by your knife
Mama she used to say, gotta get out the ghetto
Mama she used to say, morning comes and goes
Mama she don't know, I gotta get mine whoa, gotta get, mine

I'm livin' in the age of di chronic, forty ounce and blunts
The type of decent women allah know ah stunts
Now I got to wear Versace just to get a gal to watch me
It ain't no sunshine, how can I get mine?
Why I sell myself for modern day slavery?
Now I'm doin' LP's for 5cent royalties
Mama can ya save ya son? All these leeches over me
Feel like gathering my duns, gettin' all our guns
Count down 3, 2, 1, come down Mad Lion!

(Mad lion) yo yo roll a spliff, what, yeah!
Di night is young, We all got our guns
Who's down to go commit a robbery? A robbery
I gotcha block on lock soliciting private stocks of trees
Direct in boat from di West Indies
Jamaica, experience it just break ya
Smoke it inna ya blunts, Philly leaves are ya paper
I tell it, into my sensimilla place, my bodega
Here I got all type of flavor
Distribution major, no dealer can match me equal
Niggas buy my mixes, sell it as dimes to the people

Mama she used to say, don't live by your knife
Mama she used to say, gotta get out the ghetto
Mama she used to say, morning comes and goes
But, Mama she don't know, I gotta get mine whoa, gotta get, mine

Well den, huh!
When I was six I received my nines as a birthday gift
Pray ya Lord if ya see my nines
It's enough to make any grown man cry,
Now mama neva' tell me policeman would arrest me
Even though I without coach, me
an den try ti warn me ?
Dem ever get swole me, recruit me to di army guy tell me
I found out these things by my lonely. Well, well
X amount of things lead to see ya get dead
Livin' on dem greed ya get shot, knot dem face
Dem wanna lose dem life an weh say willed argument
Dey body all up pulpit cement, well well.

? get sense in a fuckin' situation
Everybody know say I man nev' run from provocation
The way things are run now the yout up inna possession
Fuck around an us buck dem inna point on, black Talon

Mad Lion,"If you got an itch to catch some havoc there's mayhem in the plastic
City of La La I mean the land of holy zsa zsa
The wood is hot and you can spot the flocks of people like sheep,
Those with dreadlocks to jocks with Reeboks, fleeing hard rocks
A la Cafe, bambatta flashy fashion
Imagine crashing bashes with bitches
That be bad and wishing for the fame and recognition
There on a mission for self, baby
Were like the twelve, my tribe is crazy deep
We got the beats that are hot were like Clinque
Foundation resonates when I speak
And if by chance you catch it then listen, the wisdom
Epic, open hitting, choking up you've done it now and woken up
The giant scientist of hits that make you jump like a lunatic
On pogo sticks, waving your fists
So if you catching a fit
I really don't know but you better scram hurry in a double.

It goes on and on and on hell rasing Hollywood welcome to Babylon
It goes on and on and on the party don't stop till the mysteries gone.
I've seen it all, I'll see it again
I shake allot of hands but I don't got allot of friends.
It goes on, and on and on hell rasing Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon.

Live from the city of lights sunny days and late nights
Dope, designer drugs, porn stars and bar fights
I drop. makes the bells rock I'm Mr. Shifty Shellshock
Call me the man of the hour
In the land of the lost taking the money and the power
CXT, we hold our own all eyes on us,
Crazy rise rain like brimstone kicking up dust
I grab the mike with a firm hold
In a world of shattered goals, pot holes, broke fokes and bank roll
Pole position
Daddy rolling, rolling causing havoc so, ready set
I'm more than set like Morissette to Maverick
Gotta, she's got to have it, habit sick, I leave them stuck
I'm getting high for a living not giving a fuck.

It goes on and on and on hell raising Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon
It goes on and on and on the party don't stop till the mysteries gone.
I've seen it all, I'll see it again
I shake allot of hands but I don't got allot of friends.
It goes on, and on and on hell raising Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon.

I'm screaming out the call of the wild I'm speaking in tongues
I am the child of the sun the power of one
I beat the drums of the crazy town click
It's the third eye sitting on the tip of the pyramid flipped
Now I see a little shotty
Illuminati front
Dead bodes in my trunk.
Unraveling the source
I travel in to self
Gauge my wage and you try to debate my wealth
The consequences linger and I'm fingering the perpetrators
Hey yo, my nature was bread on the cross fader
It's the seventh house
Armageddon trudger ready for death
It's the brimstone slugger

It goes on and on and on hell raising Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon
It goes on and on and on the party don't stop till the mysteries gone.
I've seen it all, I'll see it again
I shake allot of hands but I don't got alot of friends.
It goes on, and on and on hell raising Hollywood
Welcome to Babylon",Hollywood Babylon,1999
Mad Lion,"Where shall we land, there?
Which city shall we destroy today?
This one, or that one? This one?

Take a look a look around, we last forever
We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin, we wise and we chillin
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses
NONE passes, without studyin this flow
It's all good as long as you know Kris know!

While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

I stand with the rejected, the unsuspected, the unconnected
The neglected the one you, never suspected
It seems you forget hip-hop plays the back
Sayin that's my sound, and that's my sound
And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin it back
I'm actually, I'm everywhere at every time
Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind
KRS is my representative on Earth
Challenge him not, he's been hip-hop since birth
His main objective, is to put hip-hop in perspective
Show pity, and DESTROY these wack cities

While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

Inna style dem a ? yo alla dem a cry
Dey worship slackness and to be under sky
We lead dem to de water but we cyan't make dem drink
Pussy to take a sip, cause it gon' make you t'ink
We don't usually ? shit ?, yo alla dem a sing
Wisdom wort more den any diamond and gold
People use it and find it like de Dead Sea Scrolls

Take dem Lion, take 'em, take it over!

'Cause of dem outer, dem outer, dem outer inter outer inter
Outer inter outer inter out of control
Dey neva find wisdom til dem dead ohhh
Mad Lion make de ? roll
KRS make up a sea and bulge ya
Of the story of never been told-a
Cause we outer, outer, inter outer outer ese
Out of control, out of control
I'm so serious ay (what?)
We don have no time fi play, ay (tell 'em again)
Some people diss dem ? hell's in this world
But dey'll come around one day

Yo, yo, only Beezlebub think my voice is aggravatin
Children of light hear my voice and start congregatin
The mind's debatin, is he a prophet or is he Satan?
But the tree is only known by it's fruit, what am I creating?
What am I stating? Have I stood the test of time?
Or am I fading, or has God blessed my rhyme?
Settle your dissin, you better be listenin, forever we glisten
The metaphysician with a better way, makin a better day daily",The I,2004
Mad Lion,"Verse 1
Buckshot:

I woke up in the night
grabbed my forehead
wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
thinking of a way to strapped
and walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That when i drop a rhyme I I make it hard enough to gain
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the L ignite
Fight, I take you on flight here
The war starts here.

BCC:
See we murder MC's every day,
motherfuckers don't play,
straight from the Bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, That's when all the madness stops

Verse 2
Buckshot:
To all the Godz who know who's the coloured man
the colored man is the obvious, you understand?
I kill him, and drill 'I'm in my bootcamp
Who can't survive in the creek?
You can't
Champion, bootcampian click
stick and move
I bust your shit
Move and stick
It's the original crook
Stomping through your army, what!
Gortex to your head
Keep your eyes shut
But, I'll take you in consideration
My occupation is to bust your federation
with my ammunition
Flipping precision, being precise
He's right, I'm nice
You can check my status and my apparatus
See the baddest Buckshot shot the boodah
Murder hero to clean your pipe like Ruger
Smoke a bag of charm then I drop the bomb,
Buckshot I represent the Arm Leg Leg Arm
Head, natty dread, boy big him up
Roll thick like syrup
cause chaos and terror

Chorus

I had a vision
It appeared to me in the form of a devil
but the rebel wasn't there to see
for me this is the year to be
the son of the seven, representing the sea
the heatseeker
the cypher maker
quick to take a
sec to re-a-lize, I burn right through you
Double gauge
I'm pointing the rage at your culu
....
We blew the motherfucker
Now we outta here.

We are wreckless and wild
We're the kings of the night

We got the fire burning red hot
And we never stop
Give it all you got
In this city we go until we drop

Mad Maxwell,"She says it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat 
She's always worried about things like that 
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault 
And she only sleeps when it's raining 
And she screams and her voice is straining 

She says baby 
It's 3 am I must be lonely 
When she says baby 
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes 
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it 

She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing 
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all 
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to 
And she only sleeps when it's raining 
And she screams and her voice is straining 

She says baby 
It's 3 am I must be lonely 
When she says baby 
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes 
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to 
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days 
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway 
But outside it's stopped raining 

She says baby 
It's 3 am I must be lonely 
When she says baby 
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes 
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

Its a Limousine full of smoke - smoking big baby
Going off the Hennessey and Coke - drinking big baby
She don't belong
Rollin' on chrome
International players on the microphone 
Asi es, why no para
So calle de la muerca

Me gusta como bailar
En es samias desmerada strailas

Ah, she gone up and she like goes to
But still I put it up like I'm posed to
I fuck with sqaws let you squares cleed'n get close to

She love the way I walk my 3000$ alligators

The pinky greens and the platinum chains
She said she always want to do it on the danceflo'
I took a shyders and gin and told her get up out your pants ho'

[Mr. Lil One]
Well I'm Lil One I got bitches galore
You may have a lot bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper hit's and my chin check tips
Dick between the tits and I'm aimin at the lips
Chips by the dozens and I might when of your cousins
Even know your sister, she tried to give me blisters
Now she goes around tellin people that I kissed her
Mr. Lil One be the one wit the women
Swimmin in em, but I know about the venom
I send em on their way, right away when they play
Let me tell you about this bitch I met the other day
Walkin down the block, and we parked and we talked
Came over my house, she was bobbin on the cock
Isn't that a shame, I got a little fame
I'm all up in your girl and I don't even know her name
Damn what a hassle, I'm an asshole

[Mad One]
Stumblin, wobblin out the cantina
That's when I seen her, nasty cochina
Met her through her prima
Quick to approach, puffin on a roach
Blowin smoke, baby wants to choke
Broke lil ass, had a cash
Straight to the point, left lipstick on my joint
Started askin questions, What I've been up to?
Still makin the music that you ride and bump to
Professional hooker that strips for the chips
Pierced nipples and clit, likes to play wit the whips
Exotic, erotic, you want it you call it
But watch your play boy cause she's out for the wallet
Ready for the smackdown, pornos in the background
Hi-jack a pussy, slap her, known to be a nut cracker
And if you at there payin, she straight up playin
The role of a spouse but never at the house

[Chorus]
[Siccmade]
We gotcha feelin the funk from your neck to your feet
High Diego shit make you get out your seat
You know what time it is every time you see me
All the freaks in the front always beggin for a piece
Of this spicy young thug, all out for the blood
But you won't see that Siccmade fightin in the club
I got to much love for them cats out there
And them hoochies and hoodrats with no underwear
You can stare if you wish, caution is blindin
You look so surprised, to see that Siccness rhymin
Good timin, Goodfellas, we know how to rock-a-fella
Infamous lyricist gotcha reachin like Helen Keller
Turn that shit up, Sicc and Lil One is gotta bump
Platinum bound Sickos via satellite, now what
Across the gloe we go, into new deminsions
Third world countries, Caribbean, big pimpin

[Frost]
Now the party don't start til I walk in
And I probably won't leave until the thing ends
So in the mean time, and in between times
If you work your shit, I'll work mine
Man we came here together so we could have fun
Frost, Malo Uno, Sicc and Lil One
The Latin Kings, ready to do big things
Like some big time West Coast rap machines
I'ma give you what I got and baby that's plenty
Gon, make it crack, baby back at the telly
Gonna make you wet, gon make you sweat
Just to see how nasty you can get
Chill on the set wit a glass of moet
And if you can't back up what you say
Then you ain't shit

I?m so sorry that I cared for you at all

Let me know that you are more than a parasite feeding
Drain all my blood just to keep you from breeding
Now it?s time I need to let you go
Now It?s Time I need to gain control

And my soul is aching for truth

Mad Project,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Step on niggaz domes, leavin crews with Down's Syndrome
I'm Skillz, ending out the Extra Abstract
Grinding on nouns, hittin verbs from the back
It's like that, that's the only way it'll be
So if it gets said nigga, it got to be by me
I represent V-A well, peace to the Cella Dwell
Washing-tons of rappers up, like my first name was Denzel
Who want to come test and attempt to come near
I shaked your puny record sales and end your career
Lookie here, no need to get fly and shit
In ninety-five, I'm on sucka MC want to die shit
To your chest and watch the mic get ripped
Mad Skillz, Extra P, and my brother Q-Tip

Huhuhuhuhuhuh like the Doc Bruce Banner
Hit you with a ray which is similar to Gamma
Do you believe in miracles, ?
Like I believe in myself, but I don't believe in you
What you need to do is get faith
Take your spiritual, out your body, put it in a higher place
Cause I'ma bring out, the Holy Ghost in niggaz
In my lyrical church, and I be hostin niggaz, uh
Submergin bodies in water, you know you oughta
Lose all the glitter and flash, and get raw ass
I've been ordained by the feeling, to keep the hip-hop
Raw hoppin and the wack rappers reeling

Who got the shit that make your wigs go back?
Yeah, WE GOT THE SKILLZ that be Extra Abstract
Who's packin shit to make your wigs go back?

Yo, check the status, I write madness like Sutter Kane
Body-snatchin MC's and pullin souls out the frame
You know my name, V-A's invincible Mad Skillz
Intoxicatin rappers like eight million Advils
You comin black, bring your lyrics, fuck a gat
Don't play, every real nigga in V-A got my back
I come strapped with lyrics and hooks intact
You ain't gettin shit, Virginia'll send your demo tape back
Don't waste your time tryin to sound like me
Nigga treat me like a sleeping lifeguard and just drown for me
I take you back like the Ebony Island
In the three twenty-five, with your fuckin wife freestylin

Crews downtown freestylin off beats

Females were all of that, I'm seein nothin but dimes
Moet on ice, yeah it's time to go for mine
Dancefloor got packed when they played All Night Long
Brothers that front with blunts passin round the ?
Crew mode in effect, party can't go wrong
This is strictly for my peeps that's gettin they groove on

As the night proceeds G's lightin more weed
Fake players tryin to find the freaks that they need
Of course they get their cards pulled quick
90's girls are independent, and ain't havin no bullshit
Niggaz get scorned, girls be gettin they acts on

Mad Skillz,"[Mad Skillz]
Rappers came with their styles and I left with their heads
Their crews became victim of the body-snatchin dread
The world is now mine, the world belongs to me
I carefully planned the extinction of all wack MC's
Now innocents must prepare for my slaughter
My style will inherit the world, just like water
Cover it like sauce, think about who lost
Niggaz minds was the reason for the MC holocaust
I'll be the first to admit, I'm on some next shit
Two rappers stepped up and left bullemic, and anorexic
I told humans I'd conquer and bomb shit
Now I stand alone and take care of my continents
A&R's used to ignore me (yep) realized I was nice
Now it's no one left here to write my life story
Ninety-five rappers shelled like pearls
Hit by genocide, I inherited the world

Chorus: repeat 4X

Humanity gets crushed, with a style that's hard
	""Crews crumble up, under pressure God!""

[Mad Skillz]
I came alone, draggin bags of bones
Slit my own wrists, and bleedin out microphones
Consider me the MC who lives forever
Rainin hemlock on niggaz, yes, the God of the weather
The end of time as you know it without a shotty
In the simple game of freeze tag, I touched EVERYBODY
Man's worst creation like the bomb
Just exist in life form, then I'm leavin town tomorrow
If I hadn't done it, the world wouldn't be clean
Now I memorize rhymes, work on my time machine
Nothin shall breathe, or be conceived
They shoulda known, now it's on and the world's on it's knees
I feel relieved, free from their directions
Now I battle my reflection, ask rhetorical questions (uh-huh)
My actions, they might make mortals earl
I won't have that problem, I inherited the world

Chorus

[Mad Skillz]
Now put thought to the word one
Cause now I got Mad time to think about what I done
It's too quiet here, I'm losin my mentality
I'm actually alone and I'm startin to see reality
No more hip-hop -- what was I thinkin of?
No more fat tracks and no family to love
No incidents makin black people tighter
No more real MC's doin time in the cypher
No wreckin shows, no more gettin biz
I fantasize and hear voices sayin, ""Yo that shit was fat kid""
Nothin to look forward to, day after day
So why write rhymes - who's gonna hear what I have to say?
And if I do, who's gonna appreciate it?
Humanity terminated, I'm alone and I hate it
I lost it all, my crew and my girl
All because I had to inherit the world..

Chorus (-Mad Skillz) * repeat to end *

Uhh.. Mad Skillz.. keep on
Peace out to everybody that's here

Check this when I flex this, put it on point
That nigga Skillz dropping foucers in your local due joint

Still getting up at niggaz asses

Shoes haotatin' in ya air, it ain't news I stay on bitches

At parties I retaits and make niggaz wanna fight

Right outta my life you and ya hoddie bitch
Seein' thous of body, whitin no infron of me

You can't touch one kid, who got two billons styles
Mean wild, when it comes to mics I be cheeting
I'm destined to find new ways so ill MC's
And I'm real with this, I come of like a scat
It's the dread heads checking for representing north add
Kids pack tacs, I pack technics
Lyricol contact, now I'm strapped on the streetz
Freezby aient, niggaz be trying
But standing next to me kin but so in lyricele dyin
I wrote the rhyme n' wrote the next rappers back
So before you run up in my face, foe, remember that
And dance in the art n' main tain
A rapper speaking for real like ban-jis when it's swinging
Not yo bond MC's, don't aim to ever round
And bust off like four pound
Now bust how they go down

Yo, my sex and be mic checking and MC decking

So wack MC's chill with defesistnts
Cause the minist that I freestyle
Can probably shoop n' your entistnts
I make beats to stort
Rappers be getting court
I swear all MC's be sampling my fucking thoughts
It's on when I hit the metchinon, beat acsin' at your show
Na, nigga I boo be check your microphone
Droping rappers and black hole, hell and head n',
Pull n' girls of smore
Like Pam Grier, seveny seven
You can't work a verse, pass it
When I come in niggaz start wrecking win like Din Jackins
Thinking they asking, lyricle breaking backs
My shit is hot, my reggae come,
Shouldn't be fucking prengsing wacks

Nigga hide that sound
Check your battle stats, cause it's about to go down

Mad Skillz,"Now who done passed you a diaper and got you thinkin' you the shit?
The styles I be inkin' get you hyper when I get and attack tracks
Bruise and snooze on the wack
My crew's in the back, gettin' blitzed like a slow quarterback
No introduc's needed, this be the jam
Which occurs everytime that the mic hits my hand
Now understand, me not makin' MC's sweat
Is like seein a brother sellin the Final Call chillin' in the short set
Check the drill when you see me write your will
Makin' cheese like grill, here to test a nigga's mic skills
When I rhyme REAL heads get the shivers
Here comes that nigga name Shakwan, signed sealed and delivered
To your tape deck, CD's and crossfaders
Beats be hard like blowin' bubbles with Now or Laters
Don't front, like you don't know who I am
Fully equipped to mic rip, brother here comes the jam

When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Money you'll be like, oh shit! That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Kid you'll be like, oh shit! That's the jam

Now if you wanna play around don't play with me
You can play with AIDS, I'm puttin' H's in your IV's
Bum raps over drum taps; rappers jumpin' up in my face
Like the ground was covered with thumbtacks
I'm in your face like mace, take a taste
Make a crowd vibrate, like a device on my waist
Skillz Mad, will he be bad? Ask your dad
Don't front, he know about the skills that I had
Or should I say got 'cause my mic still hot
Back up it's Shakwan' I'm lettin off verb shots
I take MC's, wake 'em up out they sleep
Pour ammonia in they face, slap 'em with some microphone techniques
After that, niggaz retire, 'cause I'm iller
And my lyrics are thicker than Richard Pryor
One time for my crew, two times for the fam
Givin crews sun tans, make way for the jam

When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yo you'll be like, oh shit! That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam

You'll be like, oh shit! That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yeah you'll be like, oh shit! That's the jam

Yeah, the jam has arrived so all that garbage can walk
Before I personally interact with that ass like Box Talk
So pass the steel when I flex on the reels
You know the deal that nigga Skillz be up in dips like Massengil
Douche, ass toosh, who get loose
Funk money times five gettin' live call a truce
From Compton to Maine I tear, niggaz out the frame
I don't battle I show niggaz how to play the cryin' game
Like last November, when your man got dismembered
It was me I ate his meat, and it lasted through the winter
So enter, cause yo I been, bombin' since
Ninety-one when I started destroyin MC's confidence
So peace, to the real MC's
Kalonji the Mindbenda and my man Lonnie be	
Javon, Little Rock, Big Street my man
Fuckin' 'round with Skillz you get caught up in the jam

Watch your back for the jeal' niggaz tryin to get what you got (true)
Count your dough slow, never flash your ends
Always keep a stash spot and never make new friends
Commit your sins (right) confess on your own time kid
Never think that you too nice to do a fuckin bid
Don't nobody but you want to see, you gettin bigger (uh-huh)
So for every loyal nigga (what?) it's two spoiled niggaz (true)

'til some niggaz hit crib on some tec-9 shit
I numb gums like coke when you take a taste
You in the wrong motherfuckin place tryin to be Scarface
Niggaz be schemin and slippin on Henny demon
Tryin to outlast the next ass, cash got him fiendin
to rock on the wrong blocks and don't know the tactics
In God we trust, mad deep like Sounds of Blackness
Locked in the rule of no sharin, it might seem
I'm selfish but I'm for delf I can't spend whipped cream

Dangerous, disciple killin images 
My warfare dreads be just like Nemesis 
Infiltrates, holy massacres like ?tnakarid? 
My religion break down prisons for missionaries 
In it to survive, so enlist, in strategies 
My non-exist thinkin only lead, to casualties 
I'm battlin, invadin, interceptin 
Makin sure don't nuttin move in your section 
Don't misinterpret my threats as just talk 
and the raise of a hand can make, worlds start haltin 
The almighty, leavin Gods and nations lost 
Cause when my shit hits I leave holes like sawed-offs 



Yo, it's the Mad child layin verses like tile 
Niggaz go impotent, when I kick these potent ass freestyles 
Wack MC's get mad and look at me hard 
Cause they used to be the shit, like McDonald's on Broad 
It's odd, how niggaz try to bomb 
Then I be fadin more motherfuckers than AIDS story harvest 
Throwin niggaz away like apple cores - I don't want to see shit 
but some hits and Ed McMahon at my front door 
I'm rippin tapes, niggaz still makin SHIT cakes 
Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin to get they shit straight 
I'm tryin to get paid troop -- I want more G's 
than a girl named GiGi gaggin on some gin and garlic glue 
Niggaz think they hype, but they ain't touchin these 
Their styles plaid out like stripe cuffed Lee's 
Please! In ninety-five, I'ma be straight 
Stealin MC's like DJ's be stealin milk crates 
Ask Dre, can't nobody hack it, they ill Dre? 
You get beheaded with a motherfuckin hatchet 
Haste makes waste and taste the bass 
When you see me - you don't see me get the FUCK out my face 


To that nigga Speedis Toine, rock the house 
To them heads Raw Deal, rock the spot 
To Mike the Merciless, rock the spot 
To my brother Danja Mowf, rock the spot..",Unseen World,1995
Mad Skillz,"[Verse one: Mad Skillz]
It`s time to bring it down, don`t front on the sound
Check your thunderpound, it be Skillz blowing up from the underground
Now, don`t waste your time and try to taste mine
I`m killing MC`s and going low-key like baselines
Be hesitant, VA residents ain`t friendly
Diss and I`ll walk on your back like Mr. Benny
When my shit drop, all this wack shit`ll stop
Till Janet stops, rockin` Planet Rock
Keepin` it real hot
I specialize in microphone satisfaction
Hackin` MC`s who think Skillz be relaxin`
Straight from punchline ave, metaphor metropolis
I`m shockin` MC`s like seeing their grandmothers topless
Watch this, check for my sequal
I make raps and niggas vanish like the Village People
Hey, you checkin` for me check ?round my way
They say Skillz don`t play when he`s representin` VA

Chorus 4x: [Mad Skillz]
Virginia`s in the house [I said it]
V-A [so what you gotta say?]

[Verse two: Mad Skillz]
Yo, niggas get pissed, MC`s cease to exist 
As I persist, to drill mics and fill glock clips
Don`t sleep, like Mobb Deep, I`m leaving brothers shook
While you debatin` I`m urinatin` on your rap book
I be Skillz see, the ill East Coast MC
All my peeps down in VA, this one`s for you be	
So don`t give me nothin` I`m takin` my props
And I ain`t stoppin` till my face is on the side of a lunchbox
The wack fold, ?cause they been told
Their rhymes used to be worth something like Mr. T`s gold
Now I`m in, so watch me Kline like Calvin
I`m the Dread Man, you fucked up by lettin` me make an album (huh)
The outcome is ill, when I grip the steel
Don`t be mad at me (why?), if you ain`t got no skill
No questions, no second guessin` without a doubt
Niggas know my name and they know who`s in the house

[Chorus 4x]
[Verse three: Mad Skillz]
Is VA up in here? (HELL YEAH!!!)
Then here`s a jam for you to spread across the state like welfare
I`m a special dread, that still be tactics
Doing MC`s anytime, anyplace like Janet Jackson
It ain`t about dirt roads and corn bread
Niggas be MC`ing, G`ing, war deeds and dread
After this pack it up, I`ll tell you my plan
I`m on a VA tour with Kalonji my man
Check it, hittin` city to city like a horny trucker
This year, it`s East Coast like a motherfucker
Misconceptions are coming back like reflections
Niggas who dissed, are now checkin` for my section
They want to be down, they makes me laugh
That`s like Brandy gettin` dropped and then you askin` for her autograph
You know the steelo and Skillz be in ya
It`s just like that, nigga Virginia

Uhh Mr. Eon (The Mighty Mos Def)
The Mighty Mos (the E.C. Rawkus connection)
Coast to coast (from '88 to '99)
What? What? What? What?

It's on fire tonight
Everything on my side is lookin' alright
It's high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, huh, when individual
True brand imperial you're hearin' on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos, Def init-ial
Sit BACK, and listen, you ain't, in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be comin' pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feelin' you; don't know what your label
Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitchi'n out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE
You knock-kneed and sloppy, but not me
I'm I-N-D, E-P-E, N-D-E-N-T

[Chorus]
It was a jam at the center, and the party was shakin'
And the poppers was poppin', and the breakers was breakin'
And it won't be long til everybody know that
B-boys rock the document! (document)

Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winnin', you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of turn speakin'
'Cause I'm right there like nightmares;
I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

[Chorus]

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless
Stereo stompin' defeatin' me is like
Latrell chokin' up John Thompson, Charles Bronson
Had a Death Wish for this next to left shit
Leavin' all these hot air MC's breathless

Rubber band around the wrist, be the type to grip

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

There's gonna always be a man, tellin you that you can't
So if you never spread your wings, you can't youch the sky
And you'll always wonder why... because you never tried
So are you really gonna let someone else decide
Who you are and how far you were created to fly?

You are so wonderful and fearfully made! 
Albe to do all things great! 
Oh, you better know your maker
Cause He's got a plan a purpose for you
And there's no limit to, what together
You can do! 

So you might even notice, there's not a single one
Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise! 
Cause you just might be the one to listen and obey
Despite the doubt and all the uncertainty
Significance is not built on what meets the eye
It's who you are and how far you were created to fly!

There will always be somebody who got something to say
But don't fret or be discouraged when your plans are cut
Cause Jesus said He opens doors that no man can shut
And it don't matter 'bout your status or mistakes you made in your past
If God is for you He got your back like a coat tag
Trust me, you can note that, in Him there is no lack
You can drick from His fount in Zion's Mountain With no cash
Man, ya life is on smash, but you're in ya room
With a box of tissues, wiping sniffles, wishing for Ya tomb
But the sky is the limit God knew you in the womb
You got ya eye on the clouds, and He's trying to give you the moon
So step back for a second and realize your purpose
Yea, people gonna talk but know God's will is perfect

Know that God is with you, and He'll make all possible

Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

I’m under your spell each time that you appear
A kiss so passionate that has me mesmerized

The brightest star

It sets my heart aglow

Madalena Alberto,"There was a time when men were kind 
When their voices were soft 
And their words inviting 
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And I still dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather!

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now, from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream,2010

Heard the rain beating down outside
Fed up and lonely
They were playing on my mind

Took my umbrella
And I went walking down my street
I must have looked worried
'Cause a stranger turned around and said to me
(it`ll be alright)
and?

[Chorus]
Don`t it make you feel good
When the sun comes after the rain
And don`t it make you feel good
When a chance you lost comes round again
When it doesn`t feel right
Well there`s something you should know
Behind every cloud there`s a sun waiting to show
Don`t it feel good

Strange things are happening
Every time you turn around
You get the feeling 
You get up just to fall down
No use in complaining
You know it`s true deep inside
No one has to do you 
Anything that`s worth having is worth the fight

It`s the trials you overcome
Is the fear you faced one
The victories that make you grow strong

Damage my means
Because I feed off your fire

Can't blame him

And he's takin' it out on you
It's my turn, I'm takin'
It out on you
The world is mine
And no onecan take it from me

That's his mentality
That's why he got put away
Did his share of time

Turned his gang into an empire
Now he can't get beat

It's blinding you - can't see the truth

Of watching you suffer for their lies

You sold me out
And through it all you fuckin’

To offer me your company

We all have different beliefs
That's just a fact of life, reality
Who do you think you are with that elitist mentality?

Live your own life, don't be the judge of me
Think twice, before you tell me how to be
Whose right, whose wrong doesn't matter to me
It's my life, so don't say nothin'

I hope you're listening, pay attention
I'm not one to preach
But if you believe these words then listen carefully
I'll tell you what I don't believe

I don't believe in discrimination, integration
I don't judge by look
What you eat or drink doesn't matter to me
It's about respect, equality

Live your own life, don't be the judge of me
Think twice, before you tell me how to be
Whose right, whose wrong doesn't matter to me
It's my life, so don't say nothin'

Live your own life, don't be the judge of me
Think twice, before you tell me how to be
Whose right, whose wrong doesn't matter you see
It's my life, so don't pass judgment on me

I'm tryin' to let you know
Don't let ignorance get the best of you
Tear down these walls they have to fall
You can't divide us, hardcore unite us

Live your own life, don't be the judge of me
Think twice, before you tell me how to be
Whose right, whose wrong doesn't matter to me
It's my life, so don't say nothin'

Live your own life, don't be the judge of me

Kicking walls cause the explanations never clear.

I'll make that choice no matter what it is.

But, I plan and see just let me go

I`m on my knees when I'm (beggin'g)
Cause I don't want to lose (you)
I got my arms on spread
And I hope that my heart gets fed, matter of fact girl I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling

I need you, (yeah) to understand
Tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin' over me

A broken man
That I don't know
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

Why we chewing, why we chasing
Why the bottom, why the basement
Why we got good shit don't embrace it
Why the feel for the need to replace me
Your the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint in a picture telling where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it the away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
Keep hoping for that the door is yours
Keep also home, cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl I am beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
Just can't make it
All alone (all alone)

I'm holding on
I can't fall back
I'm just a calm
'Bout to fade to black

And I can't come home
You call and I can't come home
You call you can't come home
You call and I can't come home
You call [Echoes out]

Riding high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So why anytime I bleed, you let me go
Anytime I feed you get me know
Anytime I see you let me know

I can't live without it, she's addicted to the d
Tell me she's in heaven when she's looking at me
But I don't really blame her 'cause I give it to her good

She the cheese on a burger

I saw you standing there

And I thought that it was over, but it isn't

Said ""nothing I can't deal with""
But still recall the feeling of how we used to be
I'm good in life and though you ain't
The one I 'pposed to be with
And one thing is to know but it's another thing to see
Spotted you with your man out, added a couple of drinks
Put me into my feelings and spat out a couple things
Probably outta place but at least it was fucking honest
Nothing more I relate to than hearing my brother say

And I thought that it was over, but it isn't

[scarface]
Retaliation is a must
Leavin' opposition in the dust
In mob we trust, fuckin' with us gon' get your bust
It's a - suicide, it's a suicide
You will die, nigga, you will die
Just like your homeboy did
When we teed off on him
And since you want drama, we fend the weed off the corner
And when I ride
All these niggas better ride
So if you hoes got pride
Then bring your asses outside
And let me say your bad side
But don't you never let me see you sweat
I'm leaving motherfuckers silhouettes - wet
And you can take that as a treath
But I'ma make the promise
These nigga here is comin'
Sick enough to let to make a maggot vomit
With the intentions to retaliate
Illuminatin', then evacuate
Fuck the tear drops on the casket tops
Just open up with shots from the plastic glock
That leave your ass get got
It's all about gettin' even
Get them muthafuckas when you see 'em
Stop em from breathin

[007]
Retaliation
Look at all the heat that you're facing
15 niggas agg in your living room waiting
Passin out shit, bags
Click clacks - toe tags
We came and we kicked that ass
Who run this? double-o-seven
Out of 17 and guaranteed to get eleven
I guess you think you're safe
Sorry that you did it
Hoe, it's too late
Bitch, you shouldn'ta did it
One by one niggas get they ass done
Pussy make me laugh, nigga, money make me come
Nigga set for life
All on this in pay-per-view
? callin? shots make you call yo' whole fuckin' crew
We gotcha

[madd dogg]
I ain't playin with this one, pass the pistol
Warriors come out the play when we whistle
What's that sound? is that them - in the background?
I let the mac clown and shut this whole set down
Rap-a-lot mafia's murderous circle
We kill em done, go get your guns
None survive when I scream the die-die
It's the mister from the free time the dumb-dumb
Retaliation is a must
Who in the fuck gave you muthafuckas the nuts
To try to buck
Wanna bust? nigga what? !
It's dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, in the back is where the pistols pump
I lift em up, gives a fuck
I'm quick to bust
Hit 'em up, get 'em up
Once I send 'em up
Now ? ? ? get enough of my gangsta stuff
Retaliation is a muthafuckin' must

[k.b.]
I stumbled out the club ? ? ? ?
Drunk as fuck
And plus my visions is blurry
My face swoll' the fuck up
Clothes all muddy
It was buddy
From last week who I got into that argument
With - came back with his click
Muthafuckas in some deep shit
And so they asses got to pay
Make my way to a pay phone and hit j.
""hey, I just got jumped on
I'm over here at ? ? ?
It's the mob that ? ? to the brain to the gathor
A few minutes later
I saw the muthafuckin' hummer
Here comes big chief
Mac-11, ready to bomb a
Cock suckers
? ? ? niggas
Was gonna touch 'em
Muthafuck' the law
They ass went up, my nigga bust 'em
This is my biz
Kill 'em all
Don't leave no witness

Handle your business
You violated my probation
Had to fry they ass like bacon

Girbaud of the Manhattan I see you actin' bad
Jammin' that Lil' Keke ""Don't Mess Wit Texas"" CD
But right now I need you to take a...blown big break
And Lil' Keke 780'll do their latest out here 'n do his thang
This called ""Don't You Know""
Go on ladies you need to get wet on this one

(Chorus:)
Don't you know, that I love you so
Don't you know, that I love you so, baby

Don't you know, I love you so
I wan' caress you slow, from head to toe
Deep inside I go, baby scream fo' mo'
We can play our way, at this game I'm a pro
Let you run the show, a queen you will be
Satin sheets, pat lace, Victoria's Secret
And I know your body need it gotta make your mind believe it
All above, all the love, on my purpose is defeated
You have cheated on your man to his spirits a g
When you know that he got flicks with a playa like me
I guess that Lil' Keke has the key to the do'
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so

(Chorus)

Bubble bath in the spa, menage-a-trois
You a driver for a car, I'll make you a star
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
want to want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter?  Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

(Chorus)

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas & benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do want to be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you want to, are you gonna?  Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

(Chorus)

Ahh...I see the little latest out there acting bad 
on that one right there
Lil' Keke from that CD ""Don't Mess...With Tex-as""

Just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she's got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress,
Now her heart's a mess
Praying she'll find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night even like a lonely string of lights
That'll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road's been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you're breathing

Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don't you be scared now
'Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Maddy Prior,"It's fifty long springtimes since she was a bride,
But still you may see her at each Whitsuntide
In a dress of white linen with ribbons of green,
As green as her memories of loving.

The feet that were nimble tread carefully now,
As gentle a measure as age will allow,
Through groves of white blossoms, by fields of young corn,
Where once she was pledged to her true-love.

The fields they stand empty, the hedges grow (go) free--
No young men to turn them or pastures go see (seed)
They are gone where the forest of oak trees before
Have gone, to be wasted in battle.

Down from the green farmlands and from their loved ones
Marched husbands and brothers and fathers and sons.
There's a fine roll of honor where the Maypole once stood,
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

There's a straight row of houses in these latter days
All covering the downs where the sheep used to graze.
There's a field of red poppies (a gift from the Queen)
But the ladies remember at Whitsun,
And the ladies go dancing at Whitsun.

And we bid you adieu, great joy to the new","The King [Soundcheck Rehearsal, Adelaide-1982]",1999
Maddy Prior,"The priests go down to the river to fish for Friday's meal
The King is brooding day and night
Black with hate, cursing fate
To be ill when the foe is in sight

The priests they kneel in the chancel in solemn peaceful prayer
The King is laughing, grim and slow
Three brothers die, he hung them high
On a gibbet they died a cruel show

The priests they crouch o'er their books and scratch away at history
The King he rises from his bed
Leads his men, rides again
But before he sees the border he is dead

The priests they walk in procession with the coffin of state
The King he leaves his work undone
It is his fate, despite his hate
That his foe lives on to fight his son",Lanercost [UK Single B-Side-1985],1999
Maddy Prior,"(Rag doll, ooh) (Hand me down)
When she was just a kid
Her clothes were hand-me-downs

(Hand-me-down)
They always laughed at her when she came into town
Called her rag doll
Little rag doll

Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Shag rag doll)

I'd change her sad rags into glad rags 
If I could (if I could)
My folks won't let me 
'Cause they say that she's no good
She's a rag doll, such a rag doll
Though I love her so
I can't let her know

Maddy Winer,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night,

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Spend enough loot when Made Men come through
We ball wit the ballas all bout dollers
Floss 10 G's in gems round they collars
Luxury life bring a buggin device

And make off like a thief with a bag of ice

A tech smith, your last request, next shit, at your residence
Squeeze with no hesitance, stay forever bent - over dead presidents
Commit acts with no malice
Tryin to ball out, before my number call-out
Going all-out, can't wait to hear my niggas shout (shout it out)

[Hook - Part 1]

[Verse 2 - Antonio Twice Thou]
Twist the Philly up
Nigga, what's really up (wassup)
Feel me, throw ya nine-milli up (BOW!)
Guns - get the poppin, forever hip-hoppin
Hot ones clappin, make it happen, with a Mack 10
Wildin, off some liquor
Flee with the heat nigga (yeah)
Tote some weed nigga (yeah)
Slow your speed nigga (yeah)
Throw your hands up high
You a stand-up guy, that won't testify
Best have tried, to come bang with the Made
Compare that, to gun battlin with a switch blade
Hits blazed (hits blazed), shits played in the club
Get mix tape love, so you know it ain't a fake
Was bustin you next, like Russian roulette
You wet, and I don't fear nothin you rep

[Hook Part 2]

[Verse 3 - Benzino]
?Sissy, get lick off, shut off, bust off, hear off?
?Don't you want to take some?

?Don't you want to take some? (bust it)
Since when you didn't know I was a Made Man
Benzino-Hangman
Don't get caught up in my gang land
?D-techs? still be checkin on my resume'
Still I wet about four niggas anyway
Never worry about defeat cause I roll deep

Is it you? (Y'all the ones the ladies love to touch)
Is it true? (Y'all be whylin in the club too much)
Is it you... Made Men, Made Men
Is it you or is it Deja Vu?
Is it you? (Y'all the ones with all the money and all)
Is it true? (Y'all the ones that show the honies a ball)
Is it you... Made Men, Made Men... c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Yeah, two thous', new styles, fly as fuck for days
Fry chocolate thai, high and shit for days
Benz 6, V-12, 19's for shoes
Mens thick with a team known to squeeze the uz'
Cute girls, jewels whirlpools and champagne
I ran game, Made Men's on they brain
Afficianado, cigars and Henny bottles
Frijole corazon gatos with hot glocks though
Twist you like a braid, canary glaze that's made
Baguettes don't shine? Then get it appraised
Perform for MC's with Bentley's and M3's
Burn bomb trees with mamis, sit under palm trees

[Cardan]
Some niggaz talk like P Cardy, won't grab, three shotty
Let off three bodies, platinum three parties
I move quicker than, half of the niggaz that's witcha and
move swifter than, cats who Jack the Ripper so
when I say check this, respect this
If you ain't with me and Made Men, get off the guestlist
You see I'm from a place where it's nuttin but beats
Nuttin but cee-lo where pushers pay the dice off defeat
I got the Rove' out the shop, take the Chrysler off the street
Too much light and too much heat, pick a fight with these freaks
Got a hundred Harlem brothers that'll daze y'all crew
But this is the remix to the Deja Vu

Je-sus with Mase, pass hay, watch us blaze it up
If you don't give a fuck, take your hands and raise em up
It's the knock-right, hit from D-Dot got
everybody bouncin, steamin up ounces
Ain't no beef, just liquor, and reefer that's cheap
It's cheat or defeat, your girl is quicker to leave
I want to know can she do dat - if it's you, true dat
Meet me in the back after this track
International, money magnificence
To go against this, I think you know the consequence
I rock Kangols, my link dangles
Got more Cash than Tango, from my mad flows

[Big Pun]
Yo, yo, yo
Hey yo my shit is fatal, one blow, I make your chin to-ma-to
Don't make me run up in your crib and kill what's in the cradle
I'll make you wish you was dead, push a brick through your head
Rush my click through your set, suck my dick, lick it yeah
You the worst I ever heard, cursed with severed nerves
And my words to every verse like feathers to a bird
Rhyme compatible, my nine'll rip the spine outta you
Why should I battle you? You couldn't define one parable
I'm thug animal, Hannibal Lect', real cannibal
Eatin that ass like fire and gas, my shit's flammable
Frightenin in fact, you know niggaz is bitin my raps
Writin exactly the same like they recitin my back
Niggaz carbon copies, always mockin my shit
But can't nobody stop me, get up on top of me dick
I'm surprised if you thick, and I ain't with gettin caged in

Was he rough?

Am I glad I fell?

Was he hot?
And was I?
And would he stand for maybe?
He would not?
Did I lie?
Does he still think I'm a baby?
If I was, am I still?
Do I care?

Madeleine Peyroux,"Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jingling
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruising with a six
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stopping on the red
You're going on the green
Tonight'll be like nothing
You've ever seen
You're barreling down the boulevard
Looking for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin
Telephone's ringing; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
You're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
Now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
Now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night",(Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night,2006

From endless waiting

It's so cold here without my sun
I'm so sad here, far away from everyone
What a fool to be ambitious
Moving here with all of my wishes
Far away, far away

Sailing on a summer breeze

The living off of our desires, then putting out a thousand fires

To know a place without regret, you make believe you paid your debt

'Bout how one risky is in a cold ditch
And one more thing about good and evil
You can't tell which is which

Well, if the rest is lost and history
Or maybe wasted on a fool like me
And that these bare bones
Would leave me something after all

Old Hamlet's done now, dead and gone
And there's no ghost who walks
Poor [Incomprehensible] tells you everything he knows
With no tongue to talk

It seems the truth is hidden where the sun don't shine
And I'm never certain if it's their's or mine
It's just the bare bones
They give you that much after all

They preached the gospel down in [Incomprehensible]
They preached it in school
It never made much sense to me
Wonder if it was supposed to

You go on down a millionaires road
Watch a while, tell me what do you see
The truth itself, nothing but a gamble
It might or might not set you free

And I don't really know what I believed
But in these bare bones
There's something lovely after all

They remind me of hustlers, confidence men, and you

Without your love and treachery the calm is all I feel

I shiver in the mirror, pull my belt across my hips
The leather's hard in bending as your fingers to my lips
I wrap it tightly in defense as if your arms were near
But for your love and treachery there's nothing left to fear

I'll take a glass of wine and recall the words you spoke
From the bottom of your cup, covered in spit and smoke
But in your voice I'll hear my own and recognize the crime
That all your love and treachery has ended up as mine

I see you in the rearview with just a passing glance
How your eyes shine, as if through mine, you'd see and understand
As if we'd played each other but never knew the score
And all was love and treachery but isn't anymore
That all was love and treachery but isn't anymore.

Even now that he's gone he can make a woman cry
But he saw through me deaf dumb and blind
He knew his way down this river of tears

So grab that silver flask, pour yourself another glass and
Watch me rage down this river of tears

Watch the clouds cover that big yellow moon
Close the blinds, mute the sun

And the morning sun must rise

Come what name in
Who run and fight
Here's your drink
Time to think
Soon you'll wandering away your fears

And the weary eyes are clear

It's so hard to face that empty dawn

Madeleine Peyroux,"I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel
I was staring in my empty coffee cup
I was thinking that the gypsy wasn't lyin'
All the salty margaritas in Los Angeles
I'm gonna drink 'em up

And if California slides into the ocean
Like the mystics and statistics say it will
I predict this motel will be standing until I pay my bill

Don't the trees look like crucified thieves
Don't you feel like Desperados under the eaves

And I'm trying to find a girl who understands me
But except in dreams you're never really free

Madeleine Peyroux,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you are moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a-rufflin'cold cowl
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the backroads

Bleary eyed and seeking a sign I recognize

How am I to pay the debts that I still owe? 
How am i to shift and rise above the tide
How am I to live without them by my side?

The fairy tales and the charades

And the banks are thieves with infinite greed and power is the coin you pay

And cocaine and hookers for days

And every congressman comes with a price

Und auf den Rest, der besser laufen könnte, geb' ich einen

With a world of love in store

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Madina Lake,"""Now Or Never""

Too long in the same place
I'm sinking into this town.
I've charmed the same old snakes
I think we gotta get out
Before I break away from me
This place is my lobotomy.
Imagine we were dead
Counting all the things we never did.

I remember when you told me
I should live like I'm dying
Not to close my eyes
While everything burns.

What are we waiting for?
These years are dying slowly,
Today is still in front of us
And we're breaking out
'cause today is now or never.

I can't contemplate the earth
All while my heads in the sand
'cause I've been buried alive
So take my bleeding hands
And breathe life into me
'cause right now I'm suffocating.
I imagine we were dead
Counting all the things we never did.

I remember when you told me
I should live like I'm dying
And not to close my eyes while
Everything burns.

What are we waiting for?
These years are dying slowly,
Today is still in front of us
And we're breaking out
'cause today is now or never.

I don't want a life of agony
I won't be another tragedy
And close my eyes while everything burns.
And I won't pretend I don't exist
Invisible until I turn to dust,
Open your eyes we're still alive.

Standing still is criminal
And never lasts forever.
The safest place in life is now,
Today's the day we're breaking out..

I remember when you told me
I should live like I'm dying
And not to close my eyes
While everything burns.

What are we waiting for?
These years are dying slowly,
Today is still in front of us
And we're breaking out
'cause today is now or never.

I already forgot her
You have no idea what you do to me 
And you, you have no idea what your doing to me

And I don't know how you snuck your way into my house
But I know that I'll regret what I did
And I know I'll regret it forever as I throw my life away, Pandora

the girl I love sits at home and I know that she's lonely
But I'm watching you take off your clothes
Your the star of this movie
The love the hate the guilt my fate is hanging in the balance
You have no idea what you do to me (Pandora)

and by the time that I come home she's already sleeping
Sit on the bed and take off my clothes

The lies the sex the heat this sweat
Your body is quaking
The love the hate the guilt my fate
Against this temptress

They dig in your bones if you let them, they won't let go

Every day drowns in lethargy but to be content is to burn your way

They have no soul if you let them they'll take yours

And when you die you want to love yourself cause you'll be all alone

And now I'm addicted to her 'cause that girl is just like me

Welcome to oblivion.
Where panic starts to settle in.
Welcome to oblivion.
Oh, I think I'm losing it.

So many voices I can't even sleep.
Typical late night company.
They asked questions about my life.
""Where is it going? Who am I?""
And those voices rip me all apart.
I need medicine to quiet,
And survive it.

Welcome to oblivion.
Where panic starts to settle in.
And I'm afraid of everything.
Oh, I lost my head again.

Welcome to oblivion.
Where my whole life is caving in.
And I can't stand who I am.
Oh, I think I'm losing it.

(I lost my head again.)
(I lost my head again.)

Then I met you
You were standing all alone.
Cause you felt it too.
The world has broken you down.
You and me
Are gonna make it through.
Cause now we know

As I fall apart inside.
All of my thoughts collide.
And that's no way to live a life.

Madina Lake,"I wish I had something to say
I wish I had someone to say something
To who understands what I’ve been through
I wish I wasn’t paranoid
I wish that I could trust everyone I want to
But I guess I love a bunch of fools
I wish I had somewhere to go
I wish there was a place without spies in disguises
And invisible reminders of you

It feels like all the galaxies colliding into us

Hid from it every day
Because I’ve seen some horrible things
And thanks to memory
I doubt they’ll ever leave
And all my friends are like chameleons
They’re into shape-shifting and I don’t trust anything
I blame the jealousy, the insecurity
But that is such a waste
As of today all that shit changes

I don’t care anymore
If it’s okay with you, I’ll be the judge of me
And you can just peace
I don’t care anymore
I’ll watch some porno girl
I’ll take a pill or two if I wanna chill

I’m gonna pour another vodka drink
And I don’t care what you think
Everyone’s on something
And you can find mister popular, but crack him open girl
And you’ll find something wrong
If I could cure insecurity
How fucking rich would I be?
I’d sell it all to you and then you’d leave

But I don’t care anymore
If it’s okay with you, I’ll be the judge of me
And you can just peace
I don’t care anymore

Sometimes I feel as if my walls are closing in
Maybe I’m just paranoid or am I focused in

And you can just peace

Take the skin off of my back
Take the feet from under me

Take in all the people I like
Break in all my sunny skies
And I will take all of your rain

I would never let that fly

Fuck ‘em all, it’s our world
Can’t let 'em get into here

Before you tell me we’re finished here
Already know you’ve been hurt before

Talk's cheap, actions speak

And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids 

[Madlib] 
Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner 
Cause we on a war path, droppin' math 'cause we only want to 
Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real 

Episode #2: God's Gift 

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass 


Episode #4: Medaphoar and Oh No 

[Chorus: Medaphoar] 
Everyday it's like a level in this game that we live 
Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed 
Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold 

[Medaphoar] 
Straight in all black on the attack be Medaphoar so freeze back 
So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La""

Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
I live by name and cut veins 
Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses 

[Chorus]

Older cats max with young godz that got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums 
From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
When I dine, the automatic weapon 
Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
Niggaz talk about they rollin deep up in here 
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair 

[Chorus]

Older
Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down 
Yeah, and yo 
Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin? 
I want to tell y'all 
Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp 
Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin 
YouknowhatI'msayin? 
Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child 
So just take your time and handle life as it comes 
Motherfuckin' Rubbabandz, the young godz comin' through 
Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 

Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace 
Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
We never play with commercialism 
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism 

My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
I'm packin' chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones 
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal 

[Chorus]

Older cats max, the young godz yo they got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung by the killa bee stinga from the slum 
Come the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 

Older cats max, young godz got the guns 
Out of town niggaz best to run 
Yo, older cats mack, the young godz, check it out 
Yo, older cats mack, the young godz, they got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung by the killa bee stinga from the slum 
From the young Shaolin Monks, takin heads with the tongue 
From the slum comes the young Shaolin Monks, takin' heads with the tongue 
Older cats mack, but young godz got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung 
Killa bee stinga from the slum, come the young 
Shaolin Monks taking heads with the tongue 
Older cats max, but young godz they got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run

Older cats max but young godz they got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run

This bed is cold, tonight
Pictures of you
I've lost in my time
Devil may cry

Appena mi sveglio sto dentro la ruota
E' da un po'che non ti sento non sento la moka
Sono off la mia casa è una bettola nota
Ho la colf non so mai dove metto la droga
Ora che c'ho un po'di grana e fama è risaputo
Che la gente è strana mi infama e poi mi saluta
Mo che l'abito fa il monaco ho I crampi allo stomaco
Crisi di panico l'alito che sa di sambuca
Gli occhi li ripeto di non piangere
Chiuso in casa come fossi in carcere
Col fuso di Los Angeles
So bene come ci si sente al margine
Ma più sono fragile più scrivo perle magiche
Prendo a calci
Tu immaginati un ciclo
Di giorni come pagine di un libro
Un bivio dove la via più facile è il suicidio
Da solo al buio dentro la voragine
Ho ingerito un bambino
Costretto a diventare cattivo

Devil may cry
This bed is cold, tonight
Pictures of you
I've lost in my time

Nella retta via mica ci cadi dentro
Non è terapia sto rap è accanimento
Sto in camera mia mi fumo un clarinetto
Mi alimento come il fuoco mille gradi dentro
Piscio nella vasca di un hotel di lusso
Per spiegarti quanto poco basta che poi perdi il gusto
Io sono brutto sono tutto tranne un bell'imbusto
Ma nelle mutande ho sempre un bell'imbusto
Questa tipa faccio finta che mi vuole bene
Dopo mi scordo come si chiama e anche da dove viene
Poi mi fumo più di un grammo e mangio come viene
Non so da quando c'avrò le valvole del cuore piene
Mo a chi mi rinfaccia I soldi faccio boccacce
Perchè gli rompevo il culo pure low budget
Guardami e rifatti gli occhi, collagene
Quando spicco il volo non piangere
Ciao

Madman,"Dopo che un rischio si prende
Poi non esistono ammende
La gente mi pensa in Ferrari
Io penso magari sto disco non vende
Mi gratto le palle ma se così fosse
C'avrei la risposta che serve
La scusa per mollare tutto
La scusa per poi stare in lutto

Come i falliti che parlano male di ciò
Che non hanno raggiunto
Restano all'asciutto
Io pago l'affitto
Mia madre l'aiuto
Sto mutuo dannato
Poi finisce il tour e sto punto daccapo
Ed io che ho pensato a quanto tutto è vago
Sono magro pure se mi tatuo
E sparisco nel vuoto sono un fuoco fatuo

Gocce d'amaro va tutto alla testa
Mixo lo Xanax e il succo alla pesca
Mi prendo tutto
Glielo do tutto
Lei è la bella io sono la bestia
Ogni mia barra è sentenza
Mi nutro di dramma
Mi sembra tu ne abbia carenza
La differenza è tra un prete che canta la messa
E un machete che stacca la testa, frà

Mai stato coi benestanti
Quelli importanti
Dio me ne scampi
Frate i miei amici minacciano di suicidarsi
Soli di notte nei campi
Pensi qualcosa mi cavi
Penso che non ne sai un cazzo
Guarda la lama passare là ad un passo
Vieni a tastare la bara di un pazzo!
Ho speso talmente tanto tempo
A sfamare sto cancro dentro
Che ora non ho più un argomento
Che ora che quando salgo scendo
E anche se adesso sto in alto al caldo sopra il palcoscenico
Ho un cuore di marmo e sto sudando gelido

Pago in contanti
Fisso gli istanti
Ragiono a scatti
Come le foto
Tutto mi arriva un po'dopo
Poi anche le gioie neanche me le godo

Per attaccarmi a quel chiodo
So che possono togliermi il podio
Ma non possono togliermi l'odio, frà",Dopo il rischio,2015

Trito rappers come ghiacco col blender
E non faccio collette
Con voi mi ci faccio omelette ho del rap
Che se rappi e senti fai lo scongiuro
Non ho I documenti commissario lo giuro
Solo 2 rime 2 grammi in zaino un flow duro
E una tipa tipo miley cirus col culo
Fra le faccio lunghe più di un metro e le giro

Con un bong di vetro o retrò nel cilum
Sono in giro coi ragazzi fuori bel giro
Dopo un tiro fai 3 passi e muori ken shiro
Me la vivo male come billy bob
Dal dottore non ci voglio andare 
Perché mi direbbe tu sei bipolare come minimo
Se non tripolare mi ritrovi a tribolare in coma etilico
Ho troppi colpi in canna
Tu le scarpe non le compri ti da I soldi mamma
Vivi ancora a casa con I tuoi e racconti il dramma
Io ho vissuto come topi in gabbia e mo nel loft ho il top di gamma
Quando rappo chiamano la n. A.s.a.

Recco dentro il guardaroba a casa
La gente si gasa
Quando flippo flow e strippo
Tanta roba manda a ruota bamba roba speedball
Amo I miei ma non posso
Fare finta che non abbiano creato un mostro
Che fa un altro sorso
E fa un reato grosso
Che non sta mai lucido è sempre dal lato opposto
Ma io ho pagato il costo dammi il resto
Perchè ho corso I rischi che m'hai richiesto
Perchè mo sto nei dischi e nel manifesto

Non valete un cazzo manco come concime! 
9 shot e 9 pilsner

Certi giorni sono triste
Altri torno a casa che mi riconosce solo il cane tipo ulisse
Fumo con la tosse sto 0. 7 poi sto fatto come fosse lo ‘07

Poi mi mangio il tuo roaster in 0. 7 
Come fossedel roastbeef in 2 rosette

Perchè siete come re ma senza troni 
E siete come dr ma senza chronic fratè

Tutti dicevano fra fai inversione
Non c'era la connessione
I fenomeni trash ed il cash
Era un'altra questione
Ora so che ogni bro non avrà la pensione
Sento mia madre che sta in apprensione
Le nostre vite e il domani un paio di sneakers sui cavi dell'alta tensione

Muori o ti adatti è la legge di Darwin
Io faccio I fatti fra invece tu parli
Parli, apri
La bocca, però non vola una mosca, sei Charlie Chaplin
Particolari rapper per bambini Gianni Rodari
Finta critica, tanti collari
Chiederei alla fimi I danni morali fra in classifica
Peso poco, ma sui beats sono Obelix
Un fattone con I tics, col fattore X
Sto con degli amici freaks, ballano sui bricks
Sopra al mix faccio troppi tricks, mangio I nuovi kids
Moby Dick contro I balenotteri, Cloverfield!
Per abbattermi chiamano gli elicotteri
Ho una voce che dice Vai, devi fotterli
Il tuo nome sparisce fra, David Copperfield
Sogno una distesa verde tipo Legambiente
Fumo tipo legalmente, non mi frega niente
Non ti provoco sai, io ti ignoro apertamente
Tu mi insulti ma mi segui tipo gay latente
Lei la porto prima in centro dopo a casa mia
Non mi leggo il tuo commento tanto passa via
Urli solo e senti l'eco tipo in galleria

Non ti rispondo per te non spreco manco batteria
Avvolgo il tuo corpo morto nel cellophan canticchiando
Ho un flow tipo mitra leggero fra, anticarro
Giù da Taranto, giù dal baratro punto ad Avalon
Sti suckers li massacro più che ad Alamo!
Quando questa merda sarà Amarcord
Spero che mi porti gli altri soldi del catalogo
Tieni le mie views tue
Tanto il disco tuo non lo vogliono manco in regalo tipo gli U2

Flavio spinge rec
Pk spinge rap
M spinge rap

Io a un party privato solo invito Bilderberg

Un aneddoto
Sto con questa tipa sembra quella giusta
Cosi fica che la vista te la offusca (sporca)
Pensa chi è che se la boosta (chi? M)
Tu stai con una bella busta
Non te la rubo tranquillo sta squillo tienitela pure
Manco rilascia fatture
Io voglio brave ragazze da rendere pazze, 
Portarle ad alte temperature
Bello il tuo tipo, si rapperá pure
Ma non è meglio l’abisso perche scorro liscio 
C’ho il flow come il gel della durex
Tratto la mia tipa col guanto
Non dal lato che vuole gesú ma l’altro
Tu non sai alla la tua tipa cosa gli ho insegnato
Ti sei fatto quella mia poi ti sei svegliato (eh buongiorno)

So che ti mantieni e che stai lavorando
Io ho un po di problemi e ci sto lavorando
Pero se vuoi vieni ci scopiamo tanto
Ci scordiamo tutto quanto, tutto quanto

Sto con la mia tipa tipo tutto il giorno
Sempre a letto ma non dormo tipo tutto un porno
Metto la mia mano nei suoi blue jeans
Rifacciamo cio che ho visto sopra youjizz
La mia già di spalle vince in partenza
E davanti c’ha una terza minchia sta senza
Lei mi fa volare ma pensa
Se la lascio penzo ci sto male, pazienza
La mia faccia in mezzo alle sue coscie
Sto co sta maiala fra non mangio coshet

10 mesi in tour di fila, sono un po’ provato
Mamma che non sa più manco come sono fatto
Le rispondo tanto, sorrido ho poco tatto
Stavo in un modo decolorato
Poi ho vissuto il sogno fin quando l’ho coronato
Mo dicono che sono un drogato
Solo perché non sono omologato e in confronto a loro sono oro colato! 
La mia ex mi ha lasciato perché ho troppe scarpe
Dice che ero meglio prima che ero tipo fatto di eroina
In mezzo ad un concerto degli ska-p
Gli ho riposto, occhio mi rovini il parquet
Bipolare come superman e clark kent
Sono al rendez vous con il mio target
Sono un parvenu su quel parterre
Il tuo flow carte d’or il mio cartier

Da chiamare con l’addebito al contratto business
Da mi scusi posso alle pretese ed I capricci
Dal rimborso delle spese a tieniti gli spicci
Dalla borsa di studio mo studio come entrare in borsa
Mica te che chiedi aiuto e tuo padre li sborsa
Costa il vizietto
Sono andato da mi compro un pezzetto a mi compro mezz’etto
Il cervello apprende e ritrasmette
Su a milano come giù nella provincia, assente
Se non ho mai parlato della mia città
È perche frà ne avrò cambiato tipo diciasette e
Andavo in panico ad ogni post pubblicato
Mo me ne lavo le mani, ponzio pilato
Per te è come se compio un reato
Io faccio una canna, mando I soldi a mamma, dormo beato

Ad ogni compleanno ringiovanisco un anno
Tu mi odi senza avermi parlato? 
Una cassaforte grande quanto uno stadio
Banca intesa san paolo
Per te ero meglio prima perché, il cachet l’ho raddoppiato
E il flow che mi hai copiato, frà l’ho appena cambiato
Scappavo dalla polizia adesso dalle donne
Entrambe mi corrono dietro l’isolato
Tu le hai scritto ti voglio in grassetto
Ma non sai che ti voglio” è la sua suoneria
Vogliono capire tutti qual è il segreto

Non ammetto le correzioni

Sai abbiamo connessioni, anche se resto muto
Di quelle che, non credi che, non vedi ad occhio nudo
So che nessuno capirebbe, no non mi basterebbe Newton
Ora che niente mi è d'aiuto 
Sto qua che fumo e resto un lupo
Sto in crisi, un tot disilluso 
Sto chiuso in studio, giù a decompormi
Tu ti disperi, perdi dei giorni 
Sogni che ieri speri ritorni
Io sono mille forse 
Mica le risposte alle domande che temo di pormi
Mica sono scritte grosse 
Vedo tinte fosche, vedo un cielo che è pieno di corvi
Ora vado con troie a caso 
Il mio amore da mo che è morto
Il mio cuore non lo incolli è un puzzle 
Se ti dico ti amo ho tre droghe in corpo
E mi sento un tot in colpa, 
Tipo un autogol in coppa
Ma alla fine poco importa (poco importa)

Volevo stare bene e dare tutto a te
Ma riesco solo a bere e neanche so il perché
Ti sorrido e dentro sono triste
Ciò che cerco forse non esiste

Dopo che prendo le gocce mi spengo, sento la tua voce e sospira
Tu per me eri una crocerossina, io per te ero un'atroce tossina
L'ultima storia mi ha reso uno straccio, era in salita
Alla fine ti ho avuta ma tu sei sparita, eri come un miraggio
Viaggio in hangover, col sole di maggio
Gli occhi, le borse di sesso selvaggio
Gli stessi forse, lo stesso disagio, forse per questo mi faccio
Perchè c'ho un peso nel cuore che è un pezzo di ghiaccio
Oggi ti scrivo random, il tempo passa, te ne invio un altro
Rimpicciolisce la stanza, quest'ansia mi sta divorando
Ho un difetto ma non posso mai aggiustarlo
Ho una fitta come un morso, nel miocardio
Cambio tipo mare mosso, poi di nuovo calmo
Quando ho le tue mani addosso nel mio palmo
È lampante e chiaro, ogni amante è un baro
Io ho seguito il faro che porta lontano
Ho trovato un diamante raro
Ti nascondo poi ti porto a farti incastonare
Guarda il mondo che si fotto dalla mia astronave

Le sue barre cancellate dal mio solvente
Le sue cagne accecate dal mio gold member
Molte erbe come propellente
Tu diventi verde come Denver
Non puoi fare niente, sono il top dei rapper
Non mi batterebbe neanche un doppelganger
Sono bullet proof, sono duke nukem
Spacco sul subwoofer, non su tumblr
Io sono un berretto verde, tu uno sturmtruppen
Manco ti reputo un rapper, sei uno youtuber
Sono crudo chef rubio
Tu venduto per per un rublo, ti hanno fottuto
L'anno dopo nessuno che si ricorda come dopo il rufus

Spingo troppo finchè doppio il suono
fumo l'oppio e chiudo gli occhi Yokohama
Killo flow, se rappo sono un mitra con le dita sputo colpi

Questa tipa sta con quello ma non se lo caga
Gliela porto via col vento rossella o'hara
Bianca panna sammontana
Un culo da samoana
Tanta roba, ciao, sayonara
Guardami salire quando vado in major

Questi devono capire che lo stile che io padroneggio
È la merda che non sta in commercio

Fa solo rima con xanax
L'ho preso senza ricetta
Da un amico che ne ha fatto incetta e lo rigetta
Mo che per qualsiasi cosa c'è una fonte certa
Alza la colletta, droga a casa ti aspetta
Milano come Gotham, il diavolo che ti sfiora la gota
La coca, carioca, infame, iscariota, la ruota

Tutti stanchi per la corsa per le banconote
Per qualche stronza che ti costa tanto quanto gode

Poi se vai sotto pressione, shalla, c'è la Kappa
Ogni tiro è un propulsore, la mia merda spacca

Sai che è tutto quanto finto proprio come un wrestlers
Anche oggi hai fatto un dritto con il Pony Express
Dice che c'è un tipo, ha tipo un bazar
La guarda ti dice il taglio, tipo Shazam
Sto dal pusher mentre conta i soldi e
Ci sta un tipo, tipo non parlarne con mia moglie
Se ne avanza un passo, un sasso dentro al portafogli e
Sa che la droga da, che la droga toglie
Io ogni mattina cartina e caffè
Fumo un grammo a colazione, due prima del thè
Quando schiaccio play risento ogni rima per tre
Sono Kurt Cobain ed Hemingway prima del bang

Per questo conosco tutte le droghe, pero' non parlo inglese
Non contiamo le spese, in un giorno parte un mese
Cominci felice finisci in storie più tese
In qualunque paese tu vada la trovi
Qui la vende Ali Babà e i quaranta ladroni
Un giro in città, vedo il buio, sento il vuoto
Ma che lucidità, frate neanche ho messo in moto
Fammi pubblicità, dillo a tutti, me ne fotto
20 grammi di charas, imboscati qui sotto

Fumo fino all'overdose
Mentre a te ti rode il culo in altri 9 post
Non mi dire il prezzo solo dove e il posto
Parli ma non sento un cazzo come in Ghost
Gremo, sei cimette, 14 al grammo
Un paio di tette tra i pollici e il palmo
Droghe sigarette e narcotici random
6 bottiglie vuote sembra che sto riciclando
J's ai miei piedi, God bless
Non sai di che parlo perché c'hai le Cortez
Giro con i bro che sembriamo gli All Blacks
Voi sembrate Boy George con i leggings all blacks

Sulla base sputo fuoco chiudo il gioco don't test

A sedici anni mi volevano muto e composto
Ma I grandi facevano tutto l'opposto
Poi ho imparato bene che tutto ha un costo
E se c'è il verde è tutto apposto
Ti è mai capitato fra
Ti hanno chiesto mai sei pazzo?
Un secondo prima che stai decollando
Io una vita che non sento altro
Merde che ti guardano dall'alto in basso
(Succhiatemi ancora il cazzo)
Poi mi sono rotto il cazzo ho detto li sorpasso
Senza avere la sirena pure senza clacson
Posso fottere il sistema pure senza password
Mi sentivo sfrecciare tra la gente in coda
Dentro al centro commerciale con la mente vuota
Quando pompo dallo stereo c'ha la pelle doca
Frate è come stare su un aereo quando perde quota
Su-sulle voragini mai prese strade più facili
La notte in giro coi grandi
Di giorno dormivo sui banchi
Pensano sei stanco ti immagini?
Ora che ho il cash a tre zeri
Tutte ste puttane, Tezenis
E mi sveglio allora che voglio
Ora che mi riempio il portafoglio con il textedit
Volevamo essere I primi come dei pionieri
Ma non siamo nati ricchi come petrolieri
Fatti coi tatoo e coi piercing coi problemi
In strada tanti Misfits coi poteri

Dalla merda fino al primo posto
Ora mi conosci pure se non ti conosco
Sbrano questa cena fino all'osso
Stappo il vino rosso
Finche è tutto apposto
Stappo il vino rosso finche è tutto apposto
Faccio un tiro grosso finche è tutto apposto
Parlano di me ma per me è tutto apposto
Se c'è il verde è tutto apposto

Tutto apposto
Soldi nella tasca sì ma pochi
Prima andavo avanti come Steve Aoki
Chiudo la porta così questi non mi fottono nemmeno da tergo
Tiro su due mani nel mio letto d'albergo
Panetta da due piani io c'ho un etto a castello
Così non penso alle occasioni che non mi hanno dato
Chiuso in casa con lo stomaco annodato
Uccido questa scena chiama l'avvocato
Tu prendi un bus compagno con la bussola
Che mi sono perso in mezzo a ste due big boobs
Sei confuso tipo anziano con un ictus
Tu fai schifo quindi esploderai con il pus
(Ora tutto questo per me)
Cerco di restare calmo ma spesso il cervello mi sbotta
Il mondo va al contrario infatti vede un sacco di vermi con l'uccello in bocca
(Quindi non giocare con me)
Non ho scheletri ho solo quest'indoor chiusa negli armadi
Qua tutto apposto ora fra sono il capo
E tu qua batti il capo solo quando cadi

Con cui ho imparato con le guardie come comportarmi 
E i pezzi di merda come evitarli 
Fumo questa per medicarmi 
Menti deliranti 
Sempre pronti per la merda e per i party 
Il flow è alieno la gente si pensa che ho i contatti con la N.A.S.A. 
Invece ho una delivery giù in plaza 
Take away prendi e porta a casa

On his hands and knees

Read about the knicker thief, underwear taker

Never closes early, always cleans the floor

But when darkness hits the town
And there's washing on your line
Get your knickers down
Before the dreaded sign
When the clock strikes eight
And you're snuggled up in bed
He'll be at the garden gate
Filling underwear with dread

Dirty weekend in a hotel

Jaunty old george, a happy sixty-three,
Not very tall, but healthier than me.

Springs in his legs and elastic in his feet.

Gives your hosiery a fright,
And doesn't say pardon.
As soft as a breeze,
With an arm full of underwear,
On his hands and knees,
Dreams about the knicker scare.

Hello there george, newsagent on the corner,
How's the old car, yes the climate's getting warmer,
Chatty old george as you get your morning paper,
Read about the knicker thief, underwear taker.
Bids you 'good day', as you wander out the door,
Never closes early, always cleans the floor.

But when darkness hits the town,
And there's washing on your line,
Get your knickers down,
Before the dreaded sign.
When the clock strikes eight,
And you're snuggled up in bed,
He'll be at the garden gate,
Filling underwear with dread.

He was closed today, maybe gone to mow the lawn,
I had to go further down the road to get me current bun,

No it couldn't be, but yes it is,
Difficult to see from these photofits.

But they are after him,
Of that you can be sure,
They've called him on the phone,
They've knocked on his door.

Gone to stay with some mates,

And saw his own face.","In the Middle of the Night [Rehearsal Tape, 1979]",1979

Gasping for the hot air
But the chest pain it won't go.

Words are whispered frantically
But don't seem to be heard.
What about the wife and kids?
They all depend on me!

Having fun and playing fools
Smashing up the woodwork tools
All the teachers in the pub
Passing round the ready-rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunchtime bell will ring again.

But, did it really turn out bad
All I learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules
Oh what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways
To make a difference to the days.

The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gone to fight with next door's school
Every term, that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails.

Lots of smells and lots of noise
Playing football in the park
Kicking pushbikes after dark

Pulling hair and eating dirt

Controlled signs of hysteria

A crack in the curtains is unlocked
No meeting with a mother or greeting a friend
Sharp looking boot-jack with some time to spend

Sick and tired of abuse
Controlled signs of hysteria
But like when dawn arrives
He remembers his leisure

He rides tonight through his manor
I can see his conscience get the better
From a doorway stepped in shadowed leather
Exchanging handshakes for money
And pleasure

He crawls tonight through his scum
From a dirty window his body's numb
Beneath the street lamp tilts shoulders bent
Meets his pickup who pays his rent

And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise

Is always Mister Right

Some boys slow dance

Have to let them be

I don't let them play (no way)

Make my rainy day

And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it everyone will know

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

[Chorus]
Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak 'cause you gotta 'long the street
They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been mislead by the things you've said

Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home

[Repeat: x3]
You can do it, uh huh

You can do it

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold

You better think twice when you cross the ice
Everything you do comes back to you
When you're shedding a tear sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x3]
You can do it, uh huh

You can do it",Sidewalk Talk,1985
Madonna,"And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

[Chorus:]
Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy what will it be

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Bridge:

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time

Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then

If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand

Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

We've got to take a stand (Love makes the world go round)
Love makes the world go round
(If you don't hear the sound) Love makes the world go round)

Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

Love makes the world go round

You make me want to hang my head down and cry

For something I want don't try to resist me

I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby

Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Open your heart, I'll make you love me

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Watch out!

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me want to hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice

So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own

You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby

Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie, I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

If I turn out like him, I think I'm gonna cry, baby
La, la, la, la, la, la,
He's such a cry baby,
La, la, la, la, la, la.

And I'll tell you something else

My guy is such a wet noodle, he's always teary-eyed
He acts like a real cock-a-doodle, he can't even tell you why.
If you just play him a sappy song, he acts like his doggie just died,
He's just a cry baby guy.

No kidding, oh dear

My guy is such a whiner, he's worse than baddie so
A cockroach seen in the diner, and the tears flow out of the blue.
And if I ask him to knock it off, he goes and cries in the can,
He's such a cry baby man.

I love a cry baby,

For I'm going bananas.

And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,
For I'm non compos mentes.

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat,
That makes me gonzo.
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas

I'm going meshuga

But I'm going meshuga.

There's bats in my belfry.
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight,
Otherwise I might get myself free.
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.

Who knows?

Madonna,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
[More! More!]

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
[More! More!]

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more

Except once you have it all [have it all]

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Madonna,"Something in the way you love me won't' let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free
Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand (understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love 
Over the borderline

Borderline 
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love 
Over the borderline 
(Borderline)

Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down, when I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away, I just want to stay
There's something I just got to say

Just try to understand (understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love

Madonna,"So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny, I can't let go baby can't you see
Cupid please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side (Oh baby I)
Cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life (I'm always singing it)
Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good (And baby I)
Perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
