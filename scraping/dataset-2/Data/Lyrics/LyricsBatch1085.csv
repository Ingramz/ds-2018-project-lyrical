Tenth Avenue North,"Yeah, I feel You fallin'
Like the rain against my skin
And I hear You calling
Your voice like thunder in my head
But now I am stallin'
Cause I'm afraid to let you in
Yeah, come break me down with Your mercy
Come break me down again

I'm Yours tonight
I'm Yours, You can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind
I'm Yours tonight
Come and break me down
Won't You break me

(Won't You break me down, breaking me down)

I feel it inside me
I feel You underneath my skin
These walls could not hide me
They could not keep You from coming in
So now here You find me
Right back to where I began
Oh, come break me down with Your mercy
Come break me down again

I'm Yours tonight
I'm Yours. You can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind
I'm Yours tonight
Come and break me down
Won't You break me down

(break me down, oh oh, come and break me down)

Cause I need your strength to feel this weak
I need your touch to fill my need
I need your strong hands to carry me
Take me, break me, set me free
Cause I need your strength to feel this weak
I need your touch to fill my need
I need your strong hands to carry me
Take me, bring me to my knees

I'm Yours tonight
I'm Yours. You can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind

Tenth Avenue North,"Why are you striving these days?
Why are you trying to earn grace?
Why are you crying?
Let me lift up your face, just don't turn away

Why are you looking for love?
Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough?
To where will you go child?
Tell me where will you run, to where will you run?

'cause I'll be by your side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you

Look at these hands at my side
They swallowed the grave on that night
When I drank the world's sin
So I could carry you in and give you life
I wanna give you life

And I'll be by your side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you

Here at my side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call
And please don't fight these hands that are holding you
My hands are holding you

That I, yeah I love you, I'll never let you go
No, no

And I'll be by your side wherever you fall
In the dead of night whenever you call

Tenth Avenue North,"At first I am afraid but not because of fear
But the Holy of Holies is drawing me near
Your voice like thunder shakes the ground I'm on

So hide my face in the shadow of Your wings, oh Lord
Hide my sin from the beauty here before Your throne
Your throne

Hallelujah for the blood of the Lamb that was slain
Hallelujah for the blood of the Lamb that was slain
And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah
We enter in to see Your face, oh God

Well I'm falling to my knees. I feel the earth beneath
With the weight of my sin, and this crushing unbelief
Could You really love me with all that I've done, oh Lord

You spread Your hands
And made a refuge for the weak and blessed
The weary, bruised, and broken
Took our sin. Inside Your wounds we hide away
Inside Your wounds we hide",Hallelujah,2008

Father, will You turn to me, yeah?

One tear in the dropping rain
One voice in a sea of pain
Could the Maker of the stars
Hear the sound of my breaking heart?

One life is all I am
Right now I can barely stand
If You're everything You say You are
Would You come close and hold my heart?

I've been so afraid, afraid to close my eyes
So much can slip away before I say goodbye

Love flew out again

And some of the illest killas was killed

Nigga, you with you man the dance now

You betta grease your palms, you betta grip your arms
And step lightly, I pop shots from both so don't entice me

On a Saturday night

She closes her eyes and she smiles

Every once in a while""

Me toca despertar sin deseo alguno 
De volverme a levantar 
No quiero escuchar las noticias que suenan siempre 
En mi barro al desayunar 
¿Supiste que mataron al hijo de don fulano?, llevaba 
Tiempo que algo asi se andaba el buscando"" 
Y lo encontro 

Me duele el corazon y se me va la voz 
Llorando al ver como se pierde mi generacion 
Los que vi crecer, con los que jugue 
Los amigos que tuve en la escuela y tanto ame 
Cuando me converti dijeron que yo estaba loco 
Que esta vida hay que gozarla porque no hay otra 

La calle es como un banco que te puede prestar 
Y luego con un interes muy alto comparar 
No se trata de dinero, y luego no podras pagar 
Mientras te va cobrando lo mejor te quitara 
La calle sabe que tu tienes potencial 
Que Dios para tu vida tiene algo especial 
Pero la calle viene y te brinda vanidad 
Haciendote creer que no te puedes escapar 
Pero no es verdad 

Recuerdo aquella vez 
Fue un martes 16, el intento de asalto 
Que hize con José, parecía que todo saldría 
Bien, nos ibamos despúes de el dinero recoger 
¿quien iba a pensar que del bolso de una señora 
Podrían salir dos disparos de una pistola? 
Y nos impacto 

Y 15 días despúes fue cuando desperte 
Estuve al borde de la muerte pero me salve 
Dios me permitio volver a nacer

La calle es como un banco que te puede prestar 
Y luego con un interes muy alto comparar 
No se trata de dinero, y luego no podras pagar 
Mientras te va cobrando lo mejor te quitara

Que Dios para tu vida tiene algo especial 
Pero la calle viene y te brinda vanidad

Hola
Hace días que te quería saludar pero siempre traes tu iPod
Encendido Te gusta mucho la música?
Si! Muchísimo!
Si me dejas ser tu amigo, te prestaría mi colección de álbumes
Y te llevaría a algunos conciertos. Yo también amo la música
Qué te parece?
Gracias! Hablamos luego, tengo prisa y me tengo que ir.
Como te llamas?

Desde que te conocí hubo un antes y un después
Desde que te vi llegar mi corazón sintió algo especial
Y no he podido olvidar, no he conseguido descansar y he regresado
Muchas veces y no te he vuelto a encontrar.

Ya a todos pregunté y no he hallado quien te conozca jamás, dicen
Que a lo mejor no eres de aquí, que te debo olvidar y que hago con
El corazón y cómo olvido este amor, pregunto cada noche en
Oración si de nuevo hablaremos tu y Yo.

Así de extraño es el amor, te arrebata el corazón, no tiene tiempo ni
Lugar, no sabes cuando llegará y cuando toca tu puerta, hagas lo
Que hagas el siempre entra, así es el amor.

Han pasado tres años desde que la vi, por causa del trabajo lejos
Me moví y aunque estaba ocupado debo confesar que de vez en
Cuando en ella vuelvo a pensar.

Y esta tarde salí por un café y no pude creer a quien me encontré,
Ella estaba allí en el atardecer, navegaba con su iPad en el Internet.
Será ella realmente? Yo me pregunté y los lentes lentamente me
Quité, poco a poco a su mesa me acerqué, ella me miró a los ojos
Yo la miré.
Mírame bien dime si me recuerdas, anhelaba este momento con
Todas mis fuerzas, yo te habría esperado en la vida entera, yo iría al
Fin del mundo si contigo fuera.

Así de extraño es el amor, te arrebata el corazón, no tiene tiempo ni
Lugar, no sabes cuando llegará y cuando toca tu puerta, hagas lo
Que hagas el siempre entra, así es el amor.

Me da mucho gusto volver a verte.
También a mí.
De verdad! Por que la última vez te fuiste muy rápido y no pudimos
Ni hablar. Donde has estado?
Mis padres se mudaron y tuve que cambiarme de escuela.
Ya veo, realmente me encantaría ser tu amigo y
Conocerte más.
Ha ha ha, Claro! Por que no?

Así de extraño es el amor, (es el amor)
Te arrebata el corazón, (y te arrebata el corazón)
No tiene tiempo ni lugar, no sabes cuando llegará (viene del alma)
Y cuando toca tu puerta, (y te atrapa)
Hagas lo que hagas (el)
El siempre (el) entra, Así es el amor.

Terell Stafford,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1995

And if he’s from Harlem, there’s no use of even tryin’
Just like the tide, his mind comes and goes
Like March weather, when he’ll change
Nobody knows, nobody knows

The man I love, well, he just turned me down, he’s a Harlem brown
Off times I wish that I were in this ground, six feet underground
He idolized me, as no other could, no, no
Then he surprised me, leavin’ me a note sayin’ he’s gone for good
Gone for good

And since my sweetie left me,
Harlem, well, it ain’t the same old place
Though a thousand dandies smile right in my face
I think I’ll mooch some homemade hooch and go out for a lark
Just to drive off these mean ole Harlem Blues

You can have your Broadway, give me Lenox Avenue
Angels from the skies stroll 7th and for that thanks are due
From Madam Walker’s beauty shops to the Pro-Ro System 2
That made those girls angels without any doubt

There are some spots up in Harlem where I’m told it’s sudden death
To let somebody see you even stop to catch your breath
If you’ve never been to Harlem, then I guess you’ll never know
The power of these mean ole Harlem blues

Ah, there’s one sweet spot in Harlem known as Striver’s Row

Is that I have a friend who lives there I know he won’t refuse

Terence Blanchard,"And I would like to play a
Little tune I just composed not so long ago
Ms. Billie Holiday
Byrd?
The music called Jazz

It's roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother, bringin' us back again
From the drummin' on the Congo
We came with a strong flow and continue to grow

Feet move, to the beat of the t'balo
Now dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood and the toil

Hear, ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues

St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth in all the listener's ears
Fulfillin' the needs and plantin' the seeds of a jazz thing

King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew

Basil Street blues was the whole house tune
It was music, great to dance to
Great to romance to, with a lot to say to you
Relaying a message, revealing the essence of a jazz thing

Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music, jazz music

In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk about
Diz' and Byrd, givin' the word
Defining how a beat could be so complete

Playing with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornithology, or anthropology
And even [Incomprehensible], and this is real history

Theolonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was [Incomprehensible]

A star glowing bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded alright
Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass, all over the place

And Max Roach, cymbals socking
Bass drum talking, snare drum rocking
Restructuring the metaphysics of a jazz thing

John Coltrane, a man supreme
He was the cream, he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue and of the promise
That was not kept, he was a giant step

And there was Ornette Coleman
He was another soul man
The original invisible, playing great music
I wonder why the Bangles couldn't use it

Now listen see, the real mystery is how music history
Created by white men or any other white man
That pretended he originated

And contended that he innovated a jazz thing
Of course we know who can really blow
Scheamin' on the meaning of a jazz thing

And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz was on it's deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin' goin' on, but simply good music
And you won't refuse it

She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin' poems
With notes as words and haven't you heard
Next stop butter, right past Oleo

Now there's young cats blowin'
And more and more people, yes they will be knowin'
Jazz ain't the past, this music's gonna last
And as the facts unfold, remember who foretold

The 90's, will be the decade of a jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music

I love jazz music
A jazz thing

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Might as well get used to you hanging around

Terence Blanchard,"Away from the city that hurts and knocks,
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks
In the still and the chill of the night
I see the horizon the great unknown
My heart has an ache
It's as heavy as stone
With the dawn coming on, make it last

I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love
Be coming back to me

I cover the waterfront
In search of my love 
An I'm covered
By a starlit sky above

Here am I
Patiently waiting
Hoping and longing
Oh how I yearn

Have you thought back time
Will you remember
Will you return

Be coming back

Terence Blanchard,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

Terence Blanchard,"So I came all the way from Trenton,
Spent a full night at the station,
In a suitcase made of calico brown
Now I'm almost out of money,
And I'm sleepy and hungry,
I want to lay my body down I don't want to cause
Trouble,
I don't need a bath of bubbles,
Just a floorboard for the pavement on
The ground I'll take a steeple or a stable,
Or a dining room table,
Just to lay my body down
Lay, lay my body down
So I go back to see my baby,
Since no other place'll take me,
When I stop to brush my hair back
With a comb
And I can almost see our porch light,
And it's shining like a northern light,
God how I want to be home
To lay, lay my body down
Lay, lay my body down
But some joke from Albuquerque,
With some white wine and a turkey,
Come to entertain my girl while I
Was gone
This bear thinks everything is funny,
He's got his paws into my honey,
Then he lay her body down
Now just as every schoolyard
Has a teacher,
Every chapel has a preacher,
Every angry man has 6 shells
To a round
I've been an honest man,
I've walked as straight as I can,
But I'm gonna lay his body down
Lay, lay his body down",Lay My Body Down,1994

This is my song
Now pick up your shovel and
Dig
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe

The wine that flows from their nostrils
Too red
Their master strokes too fundamental
Their saint soaked cathedrals too done
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
The ferocity of their cat claws too steel
And we the weak kneed weeds of their
Weaker breed never paused to feel
We're not the masters of the land we survey
But I guess you'd come to that conclusion
When you're ready in your own time anyway
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
Because their armour and their crest cuts too deep
And the cold landcliffs where they rest are far too steep

With you 'til the very end babe

Summarily hold the branches
People we, falling leaves, watching thieves
Stealing keys, to our ranches

A score to the sound of the feet of a journeyman's tour
I have faith in these desolate times
A feel and a hope and belief that man's peace will be still
I have faith but for how much longer?

The village green, people seen, full of beans
Imagining the course of action
And in between, shopping scenes, plasticine
Suburban dreams, an empty faction

I have faith in these desolate times
Show fear, and the smoke of a gun trigger pulling finger pressure comes near

Are turning into nothings

A Queen bee with honey
Suits you

As I close my eyes tight
Deep in meditation
Peaceful sleep evades me
But a low pitched drone invades me sayin'

You do today
Though you run you cannot hide
It's a truth that shall abide sayin'
You will pay tomorrow for what
You do today

As I shake my head twice
Saying I'd rather fight than switch
I was land rich but penny poor
But I couldn't tell which from which
As my kneecaps break the fall
Of my begging for grace and favour
Bell, Book and Candle holds me
But a spellbinding whisper scolds me saying

You will pay tomorrow for what
You do today
Though your vision may be bleary
And your eyes that see may be weary, but
You will pay tomorrow for what
You do today
On your mind it will wear
Ignore it if you dare

Beneath a bullet box roller-coaster
I view my transformation
Through the veil of a jokester
As I gain my second sight
I shed a tear and I shake the crowd
I used to rather be dead than humble
But now I'd rather be dead than proud

Terence Trent D'Arby,"You lead a life inside of your mind
That has nothing to do whatsoever with my time
She stated very clear
She made it very plain

Your subplot world is so cavalier
Yet you knew the tension inside the sweetness was so near
She stated very clear
She made it very plain
In a way that needs no refrain

Frankie and Johnny were lovers alright
A man and a woman toughened by the weight of time
But not quite as hard as they seem
Because they both have hearts awaiting dreams

Frankie, a tough gal when she needs to be
Johnny, a city hard street man
A softer side seen eventually
But they'll both be okay even with a heartbreak yesterday

Oh when a gentle breeze takes love liberties
When a breath of air
Blows your heart a pair
Of kisses where
You wait for her

Frankie and Johnny were lovers alright
And the tempered scale of experience
Cannot forever indict
Two hearts looking to belong in the heat
Of the sun as opposed to night

No, I wouldn't worry about them
'Cos people in love cannot condemn
Those who are in love too
Frankie and Johnny were lovers alright",T.I.T.S. /F&J,1993
Terence Trent D'Arby,"You chose with age
To speak with a prima ballerina's rage
And speak of all the kingdoms
That would swoop down
Stick around
Then proceed to ignore you
No flash pot pan, guitar man
Or resurrected Apollo myth
To seal your fate
Feed your plate
And just plain worship and adore you
But the pills you swill
Bring you no thrill
So travel lightly on the wing this time
Leaving all your baggage behind
As you wander through your vagabond stage
And find yourself shovelling shit
With a rusty jack-handle queen of a broken spade
You must not be afraid
You must turn the page
You wore your goddess down
In jaundiced disarray
Your halo fell into decay
Swiped by those you loved
But could not hold in sway behind you
And then the dry spell leaves
At a low shutter speed
Long enough for you to see
That you create your own reality
And that the wait alone will not enshrine you
And the war that you swore
Would pour through your door
To come to your rescue this time
Is all in your mind
Now as you wander through your vagabond stage
And you find yourself shovelling shit
With a rusty jack-handle queen of a broken spade
And you find yourself kicking dirt around
With your Paris green pumps
Of pentacles and precious jade
You must not be afraid
You must turn the page
You dreamt a world of things
Like you were a duchess born
Or Coretta Scott King
And the queen does not invite you over for a tea at her gaff
In Scotland
Or in Buckingham's back-yard
Now I'm sure 'Van the Man' of whom I'm a fan
Can surely understand
As he said ""It is not why, it just is.""
So therefore you need not remain scarred
And in time you'll find
That your salvation is mine
As you travel lightly on the wing this time
Leaving all your baggage behind
Now as you wander through your vagabond stage
And you find yourself shovelling shit
With a rusty jack-handle queen of a broken spade
And you find yourself kicking dirt around
With your Paris green pumps
Of pentacles and precious jade
Pulling the roots from your hair
Dyed from a bottle
You saw in a windows with
An 'Everything must go!!' sale sign
Prominently displayed
And yet waiting for your dancing
On the edge of a precipice heart to sing
Those serenading soul songs
That fulfillingness and consciousness brings
Releasing you from your captive cage
Replacing love for all your rage
Turning your hope on a rope's magic pope kaleidoscope
Into a rabbit's foot parade
You must not be afraid
(Eyes forward babe)
You must turn the page
One thing is sure
And that is change
When the water's rising
You can't remain
Move to dry land
Move to dry land
You've got to move on

A speck of dust from grass to leaf
If on the ascendant your soul arises
And doesn't contradict what your esence extemporises
I've been the hermit and the love thief
And paid for the privilege with tears of grief
Which soon by nature circumcises
This song will be brief

One day in the spring a question fell
And went straight through me
Do bleeding angels sing when close to tears?
I need the answer
So if you go before me would you let me know?
If you go before me would you let me know?

One day in the year a bullet screamed
And ripped straight through you
And I saw the sun begin to bleed
Above a flood of tears and sirens
And are spirit's colour blind?

Teresa Ann Pash,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,2007

Il n'a rien dit mais il me plaît.

Teresa Brewer,"See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans,
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile--
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style--
And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
Searchin' for a shrine he's never found--
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today--
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way--
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
And all he ever gets is older and around--
>from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
The goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.","The Pilgrim, Chapter 33",1991

Let both of your feet beat time to the drum
And let your heart go rat-a-tat-tat

A flag in your hand, a plume in your hat
Battalions of brass pass and catch the light
Is there a sight that's sweeter than that?

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a Daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'
Oh my, ain't it driving you crazy?
Don't you be so darn lazy
Better hurry and join that big parade

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Hear the trumpet blast, heat the cornet blare
Hear the boom of the bass and the rattle of the snare
With the sweetest burst of melody I know goes the piccolo

Hear the silver tone of the xylophone
Hear the glide and the bellow of the slide trombone
Then a burst of crystal, listen to it peel, it's the glockenspiel

With the most majestic manner
You'll remember all your life
Comes mellophone, comes saxophone
Comes sousaphone, comes fife

Then the brass sings out the woodwinds sigh
The trumpets shout and the drums reply
With a crash and a bang as the whole she bang goes by

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit

Teresa Bright,"Down in Honolulu
Beside the sea
A naughty strain
Is haunting me

Just a dreamy hula
That sweet refrain
Just makes me quiver, shiver and shake
And then you do it again

That haunting hula glide
That creepy sneaky slide
They're dancing night and day
To drive their blues away

If on a moonlight night
You got that hula notion
Just hold your feet down tight
And quiver like that ocean

Anita fair to see
She lives in Waikiki
It's like that rippling tide
She does that hula glide

Down in Honolulu
Beside the sea
A naughty strain
Is haunting me

Just a dreamy hula
That sweet refrain
Just makes me quiver, shiver and shake
And then you do it again

That haunting hula glide
That creepy sneaky slide
They're dancing night and day
To drive their blues away

Sempre um perde e outro ganha

Foi fumar na encruzilhada

A constant struggle to be free.

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

Teresa Manzella,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Teresa Marie,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

Teresa Parodi,"Casi, casi nada me resulta pasajero
Todo prende de mis sueños
Y se acoplan en mi espalda y así subo
Muy tranquilo la colina de la vida

Nunca me creo en la cima o en la gloria
Eso es un gran fantasma
Creado por generaciones, pasará
Atascado en el umbral de la vida.

La realidad duerme sola en un entierro
Y camina triste por el sueño del mas bueno.
La realidad baila sola en la mentira
Y en un bolsillo tiene amor y alegría.
Un Dios de fantasía, la guerra y la poesía

Tengo de todo para ver y creer
Para obviar o querer
Y muchas veces me encuentro solitario

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

From which I'll never roam

Tereza Kerndlová,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,2007

one who can't move.

opening doors,

Sure of my lines,

Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below
Precious as the sun to the things that grow

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so

",I Feel a Song Coming On,
Teri Thornton,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,
Teri Thornton,"You have the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that upturned chin and the grin of impetuous youth
I believe in you I believe in you
I hear the sound of good solid judgment whenever you talk

Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk
I believe in you I believe in you
And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart
I've but to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart

I take heart to see the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

Terig Tucci,"Sus ojos se cerraron y el mundo sigue andando
Su boca que era mía ya no me besa mas
Se apagaron los ecos de su reír sonoro
Y es cruel este silencio que me haré tanto mal
Fue mía la piadosa dulzura de sus manos
Que dieron a mis penas caricias de bondad
Y ahora que la evoco hundido en mi quebranto
Las lagrimas trenzadas se niegan a brotar
Y no tengo el consuelo de poder llorar

¿Porque sus alas tan cruel quemó la vida
Por que esta mueca siniestra de la suerte? 
Quise abrigarla y mas pudo la muerte
Como me duele y se ahonda mi herida
Yo se que ahora vendrán caras extrañas
Con su limosna de alivio a mi quebranto
Todo es mentira, mentira es el lamento
Hoy esta solo mi corazón
Como perros de presa las penas traicioneras

Celando mi cariño galopaban detrás
Y escondida en las aguas de su mirada buena
La muerte agazapada marcaba su compás
En vano yo alentaba febril una esperanza
Clavó en mi carne viva sus garras el dolor
y mientras en la calle en loca algarabía
El carnaval del mundo gozaba y se reía
Burlándose el destino me robo su amor
¿Por que sus alas?",Sus Ojos Se Cerraron,
Terig Tucci,"Acaricia mi ensueño
El suave murmullo
De tu suspirar.
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros
Me quieren mirar.
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar,
Ella aquieta mi herida,
Todo, todo se olvida.

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana,
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color.
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía,
Y locas las fontanas
Se contarán su amor.

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo,
Las estrellas celosas
Nos mirarán pasar.
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo,
Luciernagas curiosas que verán
Que eres mi consuelo.

El día que me quieras
No habrá más que armonía.
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial.
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodía.
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal.
El día que me quieras
Endulzará sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor.
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor.

Terisa Griffin,"As a child I felt lonely and helpless
Low cash from a neighborhood wealthless
I'll stick a wino, and rob him for his last penny
Happy days around my way we didn't find many
Momma said that I was outta line talkin smack
Extension cords to this young nigga's black back
A juvenile, thirteen, now I'm locked up
Scared to cry, I don't wanna get fucked up
Fifty push ups a strain on my young chest
I paint the pictures that I pose for a sleeveless
I see my momma only supervised when she cry
She said my baby brother's comin he aint far behind
Somebody tell me how I ended up like this
I wait for God to give me strength, I'ma fight this
I refuse to bend down cuz I'm young and wild
Do or die that's this young nigga's rough style
They'll never find me

Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
My soul will be free before they find me

I hit the street full grown, momma's gone now
Had a heart attack I'm living on my own now
My black boots and my state green all I own
And a burning desire for a microphone
I see my little man Tiah bless me wit a burner
Any coincidence I'm feeling like Nat Turner
Twenty stick ups in thirty days they see me comin
Everybody on the block duck and start runnin
A old lady told me baby boy calm down
But like in Vietnam war I got to bomb now
My cash was up a little somethin, somethin, takin shake
I blasted reddie at the weedgate and took his papes
Cuz I done came a long way, in a short time
And I'm willing to die tryin to get mine
Alotta niggas think I'm cool wit 'em, guess what
Them niggas in for a shock cuz I'm fucked up
You'll never find me

Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
My soul will be free before they find me

I got a little crew now I'm selling weight
White mickeyed out Navigator, tight straight
I got the butter soft seats watch a video
Stag a lee, everybody in the city knows
I make my rounds and I'm checkin how my work's moving
Shit is picking up nice, life is improving
I got the baddest bird in Brooklyn, she six months
She keep a eye on my whole house, my youngsters
I got my honey on the side she don't know about
I'm on my way to see her now, I'm a blow her out
I pull up to see her standing in the door waiting
Shorty fine like a porn star masturbating
She said, ""Daddy are you hungry, would you like to eat
Would you let me rub your back, can I kiss your feet""
I told her, ""Baby make the bed cuz I need rest""
She sucked me down until I fell asleep, God bless
I see my momma with my eyes closed, kinda strange
Time to wake up and touch something, outta range
White clouds with the softness I hear the music
What the hell is going on here I'm 'bout to lose it
Momma why you talking to me like you right here
She said, ""Son you outta focus now, come clear""
She said, ""Your life'll be a milestone for everyone
Because your layin in the bed that you made son""
Look how they found me

Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
Searchin' to find me 
My soul will be free before they find me",Searchin',2000
Terius Nash,"[Chorus]
There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go 
Let me go 
You've got to let me go 
Right or wrong 
Let me go 
I'm on my path 
Let me go 

My mama loved me more than I do 
She said you Pop was jus' like you 
Trapped in a vicious circle 
Jesus youngest disciple 
Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me 
Make it the bible 
Start calling myself the king 
For lack of a better title 
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment 
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities 
Like a choir recital 
Now while I do not care who telling 
Meanwhile selling powder puts food in the bellies 
Well it's, unfortunate 
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages 
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it 
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar 
Mixing at ton, a balloon 
Consumed with the same way of life I left 
Everything I know now learned by myself 
All you see are the whips 
The Maserati's Ferrari's 
So they don't sympathize 
Don't nobody feel sorry 
No mercy 

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go

Everybody's standing and waiting an they're hating 
Gospels say they should forgive me 
They'd rather hand me to Satan 
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy 
Boy you got to be kidding 
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me? 
Remember that 
When he was here 
And when he died you realized you need him here 
God with me partner 
Ain't no one for me to fear 
Hindsight twenty twenty
Future not as clear 
But I'm a rider till I die 
Put bullets 'tween my eye 
I just ask that I can make my peace with god and say goodbye 
Fuck up the world like Lady Di 
One the day he died 
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried 
To be a person all they wanted better verses 
They could market to the merchants 
But when they closed curtains 
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect 
But when you're rich nobody gives a shit 
No mercy 

There's no mercy on me 
No crying myself to sleep 
No mercy on me 
Nightmares have become my dreams 
No mercy for me 
Good morning reality 
Will I wake we'll never know 
I'm late for my date with destiny 
Let me go 
You've got to let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go",No Mercy,2010

I believe we drank them all

I was stressed, moms kicked me out my rest
My bitch left me and I was depressed
But tell me how I was most consistent when my life was a mess
I guess that's when I perform best, yes
I had my back against the wall
Sing it, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh
Had my back against the wall
One, two, check it out, yo

There were times life felt so easy, I make it harder on myself
Sabotaged the pursuit of rap wealth, cause cash is dumb whack
I dug myself a hole, just to make a come back
Was writing daily 'til that honey dripper's drum cracked
To the point that when I came out, they thought I was someone else
Ain't planned it like that, but it helps
Remember recoding every week, just to get my tops up
And fools acting like I just popped out (what)
Before I ever made a project, I would go to projects out there getting busy
The fuck was suckas talking 'bout ""who is he""
Son they been tryna tell you but you didn't listen, walking contradictions
I made it pop without y'all, I was on a mission
Now herbs come around acting like they made us
They in a state of envy like Vegas, Nevada
Fronting like they true with me, with no soul in the Prada
I been through real shit , man this shit is nada

Yo, on this road to getting money, I'm just sliding through
Got two whips, two kids, two baby mommas too
Every day a different city I be flying through
This stress gives you gray hairs, I just found a few
Found me a little bad bitch and she 'bout it too
Grinding hard, making sure this bank account is full
Had my back against the wall, fought my way through
Watched a couple cats profit off my wave too
Still running with the same crew, cause I stay true
Term and Statik established 1982
This must be heaven, being a dad plus a legend
I got a seven figure dream, that's a lucky seven
I hit the dutch, exhale, then sip this cup
Tryna take away the pain so I'm liquored up
Listen up, every day you wake is a blessing
That's another twenty-four to grind for this cheddar

With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew

Considering the weight of the bricks I laid now that I?m through
One by one sealed every crack that I could slip between to find my way back
Find my way back home to you

And I?m burning all my bridges
With these matches I light
To illuminate my path to what is right
And even if it?s true what they say
That you can?t go back home
Once you?ve cast it away
I would still have left tonight

You know baby I would be with you if I could
To trade my flesh for your bones
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would?

I carry with me on my way
All the ghosts of all the love
That I let slip away
The heavy weight of promises made
That if I could exonerate
I might just lift off today

And I?m burning all my bridges
With these matches I light
To illuminate my path to what is right
And even if it?s true what they say
That you can?t go back home
Once you?ve cast it away
I would still have left tonight

You know baby I would be with you if I could
To trade my flesh for your bones
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would?

I chased your memory from my mind
But every song I write is just a wish to find you, near or far
Through all the tears and all the time
That I been running blind
I still ain?t got to where you are

And I?m burning all my bridges
With these matches I light
To illuminate my path to what is right
And even if it?s true what they say
That you can?t go back home

Feels the same and bends the mast
The moon rose backward till its past
Time the trickster ticking fast

Oh the faces empty places we have been
Try to so hard to find the moment love begins

October comes the colors change
The trees shake off their summer chains
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Nothing censored or explained

Of the faces empty places we have been
Try so hard to find the moment love begins

If were to slip like a sailing ship
Like a fingertip on your skin
Like my fingertip on your silky skin
Like a sailing boat on a summer wind
On a summer wind

Try so hard to find the moment love begins

E vai todo largado arrasta o pé no chão

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Callin' my cell phone, tryin' catch a flight
You know one thing straight, 
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home that's your man, 
Soon as you land you say that's all me
'Cause shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same
Not sayin' I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game

But on the real you're so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up,
Your mans gonna catch onto us
That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling I got a spot 
Where I can put you on this medical, 
And send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit

No matter where I am
No matter where you are
I'll be there when its over baby

Just don't try to put'em back together
(Try to put'em back together)
And I'll just bite my tongue
So wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

(I really loved you)
Quiet in the court for the courtship
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the king of the corpses
He [?] off the wall of the fort with the horses
This is foretold, bojangles was tapping in morse code
At least to the mad man genius, tap top secrets and more gold
From the guts of the mother, [?] should move her undercover
With a $3,000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else that come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill, she done
Pills celebrating, ""we won""
In the system of the women, never knew he had it in him
This condition when the world that they make him become
Cocaine and new high tech way smuggle whole things
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains
Depart 84' Jags on gold chains
Developing niggas from a whole name
God is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane

(Tell me what to do)
Limo to the limit, fill it till the brim get in it
You can't get it, if you gotta ask
In that case I want two masks
Bottom class, dollar cast
Poppin' tags, droppin' trash in shopping bags
Till Hakeem take our pocket cash
(Am I beautiful?)
Write it in lights, molly in the body of Christ
Drop me to the lobby from heights
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay
Fourteen arm Shiva
If the government get it I'm a fool

Closet full of bones
Just don't try to put'em back together

Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book
Don't leave the restroom with the left foot
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh
Release the leash on a fast car
Feed on the keys, fall asleep in a Jaguar
The tip of thy sword is white
Am I night, am I black, am I light?
Have I been this?
Realize my begin when I find where my end this
Oedipus wrecks, mother fucker this better than sex
Material potion the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the blood of my father
(Will you cry for me?)
Sky burial, at the wind carry your, father
That I could
An anatomy, not of me, kntting me to it, nodding me to it
Eyes of the eye and others, watching me do it
Adapt in each rubik
Kubrick in plot and tone
Lots of bones, scolds to the top of the tone
Skim through it is just skin to it
You're so thin you see the sin through it

Terrence Farrell,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Terrence Farrell,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994
Terrence Farrell,"Somewhere, my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again my love
Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

You know it's hard out here for a pimp (you ain't knowin')
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent (you ain't knowin')
For the Cadillac's and gas money spent (you ain't knowin')
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')
Will have a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')

In my eyes I done seen some crazy thangs in the streets
Gotta couple hoes workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a ho don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah

Man it seems like I'm duckin' dodgin' bullets everyday
Niggas hatin' on me cause I got, hoes on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder
North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th Street bound
Where niggas all the time end up lost and never found
Man these girls think we prove thangs, leave a big head
They come hopin' every night, they don't end up bein' dead
Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimpin'
Gotta have my hustle tight, makin' change off these women, yeah

Sometime in August in the course of the night
She had blue eyes that raise December she was mine

A fairytale just like an old time movie where colors gone
A wishin' well just like an old time groove from a honeycomb
And as she smiled sideways before me
Something inside me said control myself
She had a style that damned adored me she was mine
She was mine

Baby don't worry I mean you no harm
But I've been observing your grace and your charm
I know it's eleven but please remain calm
If your in a hurry I won't keep you long

But I like the way that you been holding yourself
And I have to say that I admire as well
Born and ranged on a desert plain first to sprang whats your name
Pleasure to meet you and let me be blunt
Your a heavenly creature and that's what I want
Modest child in a kingdom wild precious Perl in a wicked world
And I noticed that the light has just changed
And you probably got to handle yo things
But I'm hoping that tomorrow will bring
Cause my number got to promise yo rang

Blame it on rhythm you can blame it on rhyme
Throw in your cymbal and get yo meetin' with time
It was kinda crazy put the moon in my mind

It's better to know 'cause,' now I know it and
Whoo

Sittin' back, reminiscin'
Of how I used to get down and dirty wit' ya
I pull up on a hot block and come and get ya
Wit' a pistol cocked to handle all issues
But never would I thought in a million wishes
After all we stood for, you would start snitchin'
I disregarded lessons that was shared with me
'Cause I was taught I'm not supposed to trust any
It's hard to see the frame when you're in the picture
But now the picture's faded, bitch I'm done wit' ya
So gon' head, handle ya business

Blood is thicker than water the people say
I say people will say whatever you pay em' to say
And some will say whatever just to have something to say
You done said it, would you please get the hell on your way
I'll never trust another single one of y'all
Cause trust is just something you just don't get involved
Back stabbing bitches get you knocked-off
Classified information being passed off
They doin' deals, they at the round table
Pen and a pad, they making wild statements
Forget your allegations and your investigations

And his disarming charm starts to work
And with a drink and a lie, in the blink of an eye 
Something amazing occurs

He's suddenly single
Instantly free
And for three or four hours
He's the man of her dreams
He acts like there's no one waiting at home
He'll be suddenly single
Till he's suddenly gone

He sneaks through the door at a quarter to four
But tonight there's no one to wake
The note that she wrote him says, ""I've given up hoping
I'd be able to change you someday.""

Skipping out of study hall to hang with the guys
Then, it's fast cars, rock and roll guitars
Lighting up behind the barn and not knowing why

He's never gonna be the same
And he'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

Got it bad and feeling good all over inside
He ain't got a clue what he's going through
But he's going to - just give him time

'Cause his life is about to change

Well, maybe that was true for a night or two
But now, I got better things to do

There was nothing left to do
The hardest mile I ever walked
Was the one I walked away form you
So maybe I'm a little ragged around the edges
And I've been keeping a little more to myself these days but

But I'm alright

No matter how bad it might feel

And stumbled in the dark 
I don't sleep much anyway 
Since we've been apart

I've adjusted to so well

Terri Clark,"I've got an ice-cold cup of coffee
And a paper I haven't read
A canyon in my heart
And a hammer in my head
And a waitress with an empty stare
That looks right through me

I'm sitting at this table
And I'm balancing the salt
Weighing out my choices
Baby it's nobody's fault
And I'm torn up by these voices
Talking to me

You say there's no good reason
For me to walk away
You say there's so much good between us
Who wouldn't want to stay
But how can I be with you
If deep down I believe
I'll lose a part of me

Sometimes goodbye is the only open door
I can't turn back when I know there's something more
I gotta find what my heart beats for

I've got a half of page of reasons
And a napkin full of tears
From trying to pull my spirit
Through the pocket of my fears
As the lunch crowd empties out
Into the city

And there may not be a way for me
To make you understand
I'll write down the words I'm feeling
And I'll leave it in your hands
But the memories of our love
I'm taking with me

You say there's no good reason
For me to walk away
You say we're meant to be together
And I'm making a mistake
But this emptiness inside me
Has brought me to this road and I have to let you go

Sometimes goodbye is the only open door
I can't turn back when I know there's something more
I gotta find what my heart beats for

For the passion everlasting
For the deepest dream
For a chance to love like that
There is no in between

You wanna hurry it along
'Cause you can't get close enough

Just fine getting to know me

Baby you can take my time

Like a river flowing
We can roll on and on
Not knowing where we're going
Living in the moment before it's gone

All these faces that I pass
All these souls that don't reach out

I want to tell you everything
Every nightmare, every dream
Every fear I've ever had

All the secrets that I've kept
My mistakes an' my regrets
The relief that it would bring
Just to tell you everything

Just to be all you need
When you need somebody there
Just to let go an' still know
You won't go anywhere

Just to find myself again
Tell you who I've always been
Just to feel my spirit rise
When I look into your eyes

And see what I've been dyin' for
Baby, I want nothin' more
Than these songs I'm gonna sing
When I tell you everything

Just to be all you need
When you need somebody there
Just to let go an' still know
You won't go anywhere

All this loneliness that ruled
All the years that had me fooled
Now they seem to slip away
When you turn to me an' say

I think you got here just in time
I think we're gonna be just fine
An' it would be enough for me
Just to tell you everything

In the middle of here and torn in two

Maybe I'll get past the loss
Either way, with or without you, I'm takin' off

Get there, and I can't turn back around
No such thing as the wrong direction 
No tellin' just where I'm bound

I'm lookin' out the window at a beautiful view.
Turn on the TV an' somebody's talkin',
'Bout the wrong and the right and the ultimate truth.
I listen for a minute but my heart is somewhere else,
'Cause I've got my own convictions but I keep them to myself.

When I feel the world around me,
How can I not believe?
If I'm high up on a mountain,
Or down on my knees,
It's just between God and me.

Secrets I've been holding.
Tears cried, nobody else sees.
Sometimes I'm alone,
But I know there's somebody watching over me.
There's so much I'm afraid of an' I'm really not that strong.

In a corner booth pretending to read on a Friday night

The possibility
That it's not a bad thing

How I'll live without you

Few and far between

Don't you start letting go of me

I'll feel what I feel

Let it be real
Let it flow through me

Terri Clark,"I was third Alton on the second row of the First Baptist church choir
I was keeper of the minutes for the Tri Delts, in charge of the homecoming bonfire
I was a staight 'A', straight laced, level-headed as they come
And parked at the Sonic, isn't that ironic, when my whole world came undone

One slot over was a calf roper gibeing me his Geoge Strait smile
And before I knew Miss Good-Two-Shoes was two0steppin', runnin' wild

Back in my cowboy days, Lord what a honky tonkin' haze
He was forbidden fruit in them tight Wranglers and boots
It was all dangerous fun, we were two outlaws on the run
Tastin' that rodeo dust, two unliklies in love
I swore I'd never give him up, back in my cowboy days

Well, Mama said, ""He's crazy"" Daddy says, ""He's lazy""
Sister said, ""Does he have a brother?""
Well, I changed my dress and who woulda guessed
I'd be wearin' them jeans and ropers

It was passionate nights and dashboard light
Nobody was watchin' the clock
It was love in the makin' 
Eggs and bacon at the Seventy-Six truck shop

Back in my cowboy days, Lord what a honky tonkin' haze
He was forbidden fruit in them tight Wranglers and boots
It was all dangerous fun, we were two outlaws on the run
Tastin' that rodeo dust, two unliklies in love
I swore I'd never give him up, back in my cowboy days

Sometimes I lay here thinkin' 'bout him
And laugh about my crazy past
Then I roll over and kiss the calf roper

But I need you to know you were heaven sent

[Chorus]
We went together like highways and T-birds
Saturday sinners and Sunday church
And lookin' back and cryin' and laughing at the life between us two
We went together like memories and long gones
Cowboys and sad old songs
After all of the holdin' on tight that we went through
You're damn right I'm gonna miss you

I guess there are times when all of us re-learn
And life is a book, and the pages you know they're about to turn
And I don't know where the story ends
Where it's gonna go now
Just as long as this chapter tells the whole world how

Right then he forgot what he was looking for

Left me cryin' on the steps
Burned me down like a cigarette

The less I want to know anyhow

I finally found my whole world

Got me a man with a heart of gold

Terri Clark,"He said, ""Goodbye."", from the edge of the porch
Like she'd been some casual friend
He said, ""You're better off without me,
I'm not what you need.""
Like her mama had said about him.

He started the car, pulled out of the drive
Didn't waste any time looking back
She watched him go, thinking, even a stranger
Would show more compassion than that.

She could've cried, but she didn't have time
She had a baby to feed
A pink blanket to find
To rock their little one to sleep
She could've laid in bed for hours
Giving misery the power
But she didn't have time.

She got a sitter, and she got a job
'Cause she had a promise to keep
Her day was the factory, and evening survival
And night was exhaustion and sleep.

Sometimes she felt life was passing her by
And watching was all she could do
Her friends said, ""You gotta get outta the house,
And maybe you'll meet someone new.""

She could've tried, but she didn't have time
She had a 5-year-old to feed
She had ballet class, piano lessons,
And t-ball little league
She could've laid awake for hours
Giving lonely nights the power
But she didn't have time.

Not time where would she'd find
The time to trust a man again
Not time for that flat tire,
A crowded parking lot, and then.

And then not time but yes have coffee with
The man that got her tire fixed
She was thinking, gosh, he's handsome
When he asked, ""Do you have kids?""

She could've lied, but she didn't have time
All she said was, ""She's five.""
He said, ""I saw the car seat, I love kids, does she have your eyes?""
And they sat and talked for hours
Giving destiny it's power
She could've been afraid to fall in love that night
But she didn't have time.

Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man
 
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Everyone cries when the money dries up

Then both my folks were in the hospital
The same week, the week I buried my dog
And the only one who sent me a card
Was my gynecologist 'cause I missed my appointment
Things change, they sure do change

Things changed for all of us
Kids, work, health, money, this that and the other
I got so scared, I just wanted to shake under the covers
And wait in the dark with my fist drawn
Ready to slap life in the face and kick fate where it hurts

I searched all over my house for my favorite singer
She's on an unmarked tape as if her voice could bring me peace
And as if I even had a cassette player that worked anymore
There's no doubt about it, things change

Things change that's for sure
Only the best of friends will endure
Each other when things change
Things change, things change

What is the color of the soul of a man?

My grandma said I was a silly goose
For asking questions when there ain't no use
I cannot tell you the reason why
But I'll keep askin' till I die

Tell me, tell me if you can
What is the color of the soul of a man?
Black or yellow, white or tan
What is the color of the soul of a man?

A blue man sat in a green man's pew
The green man said, ""You, rascal, you""
They beat each other on the head
They fought each other till the smart man said

Tell me, tell me if you can
What is the color of the soul of a man?
Black or yellow, white or tan
What is the color of the soul of a man?

I know some people who are chicken-fried
Something crawled up in their hearts and died
All that's left in them are sticks and stones
And their words can chew you to the bone

Tell me, tell me if you can
What is the color of the soul of a man?
Black or yellow, white or tan
What is the color of the soul of a man?

A red man married a snow white maid
And all their kids are a copper shade
You know it puzzles me both day and night
Will their children's souls be red or white?

Tell me, tell me if you can
What is the color of the soul of a man?
Black or yellow, white or tan
What is the color of the soul of a man?

Tell me, tell me if you can
What is the color of the soul of a man?

When she's had too much to drink.

Sayin', ""Maybe, maybe I'll be back someday.""

Romance was dead and gone
And I almost believed it was true
Til the moment you came along
I know it's so hard to find romance
When the world moves so fast
But when I look at you
I get the feeling these feelings will last

*chorus*
Let's make our own romance
We've got time, we've got love
That's always been enough
Why don't we take the chance?
Pull me in close and dance
can you bring me your heart?
Bring on the stars
Bring back romance

I've been alone
I know you've been there too
So you know when there's no one to hold
Even moonlight can make you blue
But now, somehow, we've got each other
To fill up the night
And once we strike a spark
It won't take long before a fire will ignite

And once we build it strong

Terri White,"The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject

give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care

It's the Royal, rims clean with the top back
Rep for summer with the locs and the baseball hat
Down 805, cuties in the next lane
Trying to draw attention, their number and their name
We didn't get no play we got ignored
But there's too many cuties in the sea to fish for
I pulled up in the spot in the parking lot
Sipping on a 40 at the corner 'cause it gets hot
Cutties checking out the cars that we roll
Black candy with the rims with the booms and the gold
Here comes the pigs, turn it down they're getting nearer
Checking out the vatos with the dice in the mirror
But we ain't villains that be stepping out of line

I sling Sly shirts with the Levi denim
A late night tings in after day time
Vatos looking loco, hynas looking fine
The veterano's got the switches to the side
The truck's full of amps in the back of the g-ride
Everybody's styling, Profile's Low
I'm driving real slow, looks like a big car show
I peep the cutties with the light Brown complection
Gotta bust a you and go the opposite direction
Pina Coloda, room at the Ramada

Parties at the beach if it gets any hotter
Cholos in bandanas, nobody's down to bang

Too many drinks when the evening arrive
Pass the keys to the homey, it ain't safe to drink and drive

Trying to draw attention, Latino had I mentioned
Pack in the glove, don't forget about prevention
When we hit the motel it's almost 1 o'clock
Everything closed so we head to Heidi's Taco Shop

Messin around with the wrong crowd  I learned my lesson 
Stressin all the things that I have not 
I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot 

I hear mad shots  homicide come and play Matlock 
But never crack the case cause the defendant's a bad cop 
You feel me fam? The devil's got a plan 
That's why Farrakhan formed a Million Man up in Washington 

The Hidden Hand even planned this man 
Have me goin hand to hand, killin my own clan 
But now I understand and see the big picture 
Fuck cryin about the struggle, I teach you how to get richer 

Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple, kids robbin coppin capsules 
Rockin tattoos, boppin with ankles locked in shackles 
Got the cops joggin at you, spittin rounds of clips, they down wit it 
New clowns'll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit 

Now it's been written that all men are equal, but then it's legal 
When they beat us and treat us as if we're different people 
We go for delf, fuck the cop's health 
I'd rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts 

'Cause God dealt us a helpless hand, they made us sell this land 
So the palest man could build a selfish plan 
You know we can't trust the government, cause Uncle Sam is smugglin

Even McGruff is in it, gettin a percentage 
Takin advantage, punishin just blacks and hispanics

No more wars and renderin tears to insanity 

So keep the salary and tear the mic, cause I love it 
There's my life, you judge it, fuck it Seis, I don't want it 

I'm a Dominican, stranded in New York like Filligan 
Don't want to get locked up in the pen again 
But here they come, the faggots and cuffs, searchin for guns 
Turnin they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs 

They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin heat 
Four deep, we puff production, my cheek, you know my steez 
Fuck the police, usin ""probable cause"" to break laws

I got somethin for you boys in blue 
The system poisoned you, blew your cover, now what you supposed to do? 
I never let the faggot pull the trig first 
It won't be no American flag over my hearse

Who dressed up in the heart of brash 
Forever talkin trash

He raised the pull of grace, a razor blew his face 

Force calm the ?sere? plus a pack of the ?dunga dun? laced with 
Toothpaste

They call me Prospect, I just came back from ? 
Had this track on pause, now I'm back on course 
It's lost on the Ave, tryin to take my life from the past 

Get this legal cash, ? without dad 
Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity 
Only if he had one love, trust for liberty 
This world would be a better place, get what it takes 

In a race to racism replace the snake in em 
Bad ones, want to spend lives and discriminate 
I'm tryin to keep this positive vibe, and from that 
I generate to the top, like Puffy won't stop 

I'm mature now, with one knot, from tryin to get locked 
And to the shorties on the block, tryin to twist 40 tops 
Get your act together, do some carpentry with a Black n Decker 
And stop speedin like a Kawasaki 

From my life, to your life, I'm touchin everybody Twinz watch me
Everything we speak is the truth 
From Prospect to Munroe, here in a hot second 
The whole world run know, everything we speak is the truth

Throw your hands up, my live niggas in the cut
Fut your triggers up, if you got love say

Yo, it's the P are O S P E see T, I'm a thug you can't PH.D. me
Catch me in the back of the club switchin' it up
Type of nigga to get drunk and piss in your cup
Listen up to what it is, know a lotta mamis lovin' the triz
And some, they tryin' to pull it off right in front of the kids
Before I think about coming to cribs, I be lugging my glitz so big
On the waist it be rubbing my ribs, it's very dangerous fuckin' with this

I been doublin' chips holdin' my own with the chrome double-grips
Up in the mix, caught a couple of vics when I used to fight
But I ain't been scufflin' since this is as tough as it gets
Never leave nothin' with prints or you get blast
And you're chopped up and stuffed in the fridge
They not playin' me, I perfected this game from A to Z
The ones I don't know will need ropes to hands and knees

This shit'll never stop, as long as I live, I'ma forever rock
And stop niggas right where they standin' when the biretta pop
My moms said I better not, but knew I had to
I said, ""I'm bustin' mines, and ain't nobody movin' at you""
She laughed too, like I was jokin', when I'm chrome-totin'
I have a nigga in his home hopin' I don't blow his dome open
I stay stoned, smokin' while I'm on the low, I'm copin'

A cool guy, but at times you catch me Tone-Locin'
Been through a lotta shit, but never had a bone broken
It's tragic how I rap shit with my own potion
From here to Hoboken I was hoppin' trains with no token
Now I'm on stage, they say I'm show-boatin' my flow potent
'Cause it's mixed in raw spell it backwards, it's 'War' the gat spits
You back flip through the door I kill 'em all, Terror Squadian style
I only get down with the crown, only partyin' wild, you heard me

Throw your hands up, my live niggas in the cut
Fut your triggers up, if you got love say
""Nigga, nigga what"" like you don't give a fuck
Bitches playin' niggas just to get a buck, get a buck

Prospect, '99
It's almost over, baby right
",'99 Live,1999
Terror Squad,"Yo no lies
When I was five I arrived in America
Made it alive survived the hell of a trip kid I'm telling ya
Sellin' the freedom town to put my feet on the ground
See what's around, then lock shit down like Nino Brown

I'm bound by hona and down for drama like Tony Man Tana
Y'all clowns don't wanna fuck around pana
Puffin pounds of marijuana wit my entourage
Camouflage in the silent fog getting charged so we'll party dark

Terror Squad my car-tel, we larger, it ain't hard to tell
We more cream then Carvel
For real pockets filled, 1 hundred dollar bills
Probably with the squattin' villains
Knowledge while we holla at the college girls

This how it feels to be on top of the world
Up in the pearl white drop just cruisin' the burrows
Keepin' it through from the beginning to end do for yourself
Ain't no friends in this envious world we livin' in

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cause everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cause everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo there's only 1 life to live of many ways of livin'
And many crazy feelin' is they see their money so high grazin' cellin'
My heart is so warm but they get cold at times
I might let you know from my oldest rhymes

I poll for shine, hold the nines
When I'm livin' in the streets till we make it and take it
They nuttin' giving 'cause it ain't sweet, how you think I got nasty?
Fuckin' with older niggas tryin' to pass me
But couldn't out last me

It was a run in a race so disrespect
Will take this gun in your face so I can put my son in your place
Now we can get by and form an ill duo we'll fuck you though
'cause I'm the boss like Hugo

You know the name black
My grown-nal bent, turned around and came back
I used to sling crack now I lay back and just play tracks
Make a haystack to get my fam better livin' and never givin' up
You can tell by this letter written

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cause everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cause everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Yo, yo, yo, I feel like my life in is trouble
Glossy eyes off the lie tryin' to stride to survive the struggle
I can't sleep, yo they cover us deep
Tryin' to puzzle how to smuggle my fam like antiques

Been on the hottest corners in the bronx for weeks
Do I trust you? Do you want this as bad as me?
Do I buss you or let love become my tragedy?
Always swore before I dropped I was goin' shoulder to the top

Everything I got I'm goin' to bring it back to the block
Took a chance, stepped it up a notch in advance
Made the people dance now it's time to really enhance
All the horror it's true you ain't even promise tomorrow

The bullet ripped through his starter, he blew it don't even bother
My main man, me and him had the same plans
Took the same tames, I wrote the rhymes while he weighed grams
Made me understand see the world revolve in the palm of my hand

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cause everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cause everything that glitters ain't gold

Terror Squad,"Yeah yeah, what, Terror Squad
From the streets to the jail cell
I mean, my niggaz is facin' death penalties and all that
Charlie Rock el D
Yeah, yeah, this go out to you my nigga, yo, yo

Ain't no solution for this
Since day one I been true to this shit
Often niggaz try to shoot but they miss
I been provin' to hit so you know it's really real

I went from chillin' on the hills to signin' deals worth fitty mil
Self made millionaire status
We all gettin' money but it's funny how mine makes niggaz maddest
Come at us if you ready for war

Whoever you are
Leave you dead in your hall leakin' red on the floor
Better than y'all
Niggaz need to face the facts

Since the days of crack I been blazin' gats, tryin' to raise my stats
Tracin' back, you could find me at a racin' track
Laced in black, bettin' on a horse called Amazin' Jack
Joey Crack's the illest, fully backed my killaz

Hoppin' outta 18 wheelas, like mad gorillas
Niggaz need to calm they nerves when I'm concerned
'Cause if you didn't know by now, you all gone learn

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

I puts it down with Pun
Now all I do is lounge in the sun
Look what I done from the slums, to sportin' 5 thousand and ones
See the ice glitter, I only walk with them nice niggaz

Sheist niggaz that quit it for doin' life niggaz
You had a judge, we came through in the clutch
Fifty fifth ain't no what to do when I came through wit'cha
The Don Polly, you could find me as fresh as Denali

In times probably even marching at a Shaufton rally
I often carry that's the price of fame
Got precise the fame snipe you with the rifle and unlight your brain
It ain't a game, it's real niggaz with real guns

That still run, caught a box and pump ox by the millions
Before the children that's confusin' life
The voodoo type that'll pull out the Uzi and make you lose your life
The news is tight, I got 'em hangin' by the neck
Man you tanglin' with vets when you bangin' with TS
(What, what the fuck)

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

I ain't know you really want it

Through the levels of hell in this atrocity
Bust my guns at the heavens till an angel fell on top of me
He said his name was Michael and introduced me to evil acts like
Robbin parties and pumpin the shotie to keep em back
Nobody move, nobody get burst open
Just give up the jewels before your purse-totin-

You packin it? Better be bustin, I'm steadily rushin
Up in your crib with a wig and my metal heavenly trusted
You pussed it, but it ain't the cops
Turn your back, and like you saw death
Lost breath, I left you in shock
You was amazed how the glock raised from the waist
Got blazed in your face, was about to drop mace in the place
Chill like I did enough, cause real niggas hit em up
We'll leave it at that for the paramedics to pick it up
This ain't a cartoon, I bring light to the darkroom
And spark boom, step in my path, I leave a heart wound
We pullin out without bustin, no, make no sense

Tell your man in the black van I like it when my canon react

An urban legend, in God's eye the perfect seven
