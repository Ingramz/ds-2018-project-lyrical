Trouble,"Don't cry I know it might be hard
But I won't be very far
Remember how to smile
I need to leave you for a while

There is a way think I found another day
There is a way think I found another day

I hope you know that I love you
So the skies keep turning blue
Stand up and face all your fear
Think of me through the years

There is a way think I found another day
There is a way think I found another day

Live on all things are the same
For my sake and in my name
Never be afraid to die
Cause I'll be waiting in the sky

There is a way think I found another day
There is a way think I found another day",Another Day,1995
Trouble,"I don¦t believe in your opinions
After all you¦re the one who's wrong
Hey man I know what you're sayin
I don¦t care anymore

So how does it feel
Below me

I don¦t believe in your decisions
Another stupid politician
Hey man I know what you're playin
Couldn't take it anymore

So how does it feel
Below me

I don't believe in your religion
After all what makes you so right
Hey man I hear what you are sayin
I don't care anymore

So how does it feel
Below me",Below Me,1995
Trouble,"Flow through my mind love sometimes I forget
Tall tales of once upon a time we might regret
Bug-eyes monsters universal fear
In the mirror he finds himself for real

And the world keeps on return
In the cradle where it lies
Ten years of fire burns
Into the eye

A hand around my eyes lead me I am blind
Still I am delight of everything I find
Animation of souls expressed in dance
Thirty white horses on a red hill in trance

And the world keeps on turnin
In the cradle where it lies
Ten years of fire burns
Into the eye

Repeat 1st verse
Repeat chorus",The Eye,1995
Trouble,"Desperate desire all in tune
By the doors of a legend to
Lonely time eaten towers
Resemble nothing that is ours

Where all the flowers are
Here to greet the sun
Oh no the stars are gone
I know we¦ll see them later on

Drowned in a bath of eternal lust
Sleep sort of a visual dust
Maybe you went too far
I want to be where you are

Where all the flowers are
Here to greet the sun
Oh no the stars are gone
I know we¦ll see them later on

So many years have since gone by
Strangle design how heroes fly
All that remains is true
How the music plays for you

Where all the flowers are
Here to greet the sun
Oh no the stars are gone
I know we¦ll see them later on",Flowers,1995
Trouble,"Scarcely breathing silence
Slowly running out of patience
I know that you want her only
So obscured and lonely

Hear the earth and feel the sun
Who is the unfortunate one

Appearances, all it ever seemed
No inspiration never dreamed
Dripping tears all over my head
Changing places with the dead

Hear the earth and feel the sun
Who is the unfortunate one

Scarcely breathing silence
Ordinary day existence
I know that you want her only
So obscured and lonely

Hear the earth and feel the sun
Who is the unfortunate one",Hear the Earth,1995
Trouble,"On the road of winters misery
Drifting motionless in pain
Enlightened dreams capes are assured
Sad certainty of mine
Hallucinations are clearly all around

Long shadows fallen down
Long shadows fallen down

Desperation bleeds insanity
Disruptive angels haunt my brain
Appealing mercy of the fire
Dances slow on fire
Hallucinations are clearly all around

Long shadows fallen down
Long shadows fallen down

On the road of winters misery
Drifting motionless in pain
Enlightened dreams capes are assured
Sad certainty of mine

They're not exactly what they seem
Night sleeps never bringing me dreams
Soothing sounds of your machine

Hey you Mr. Green Man
Won't you be my friend
Hey you Mr. Green Man
Keep fuckin with my head

Other friends have flown before
Mourning worn by the poor
Misunderstanding keeps knockin at my door
Just the wind and nothing more

Keep fuckin with my head

Trouble,"Memories garden just came true
Now there¦s nothing I can do for you
All the good times we once had
Wonder why I feel so sad

Come on listen to the wind my friend
You can still hear her sing
Come on listen to the wind my friend
She is everywhere

Only trying to get me home
Never felt so alone you know
Now I pray your soul to keep
Closed your eyes get some sleep

Come on listen to the wind my friend
You can still hear her sing
Come on listen to the wind my friend
She is everywhere

I can see you in my mind
All those moments are now lost in time
Requiem can now be sung
Wonder why she died so young

Come on listen to the wind my friend
You can still hear her sing
Come on listen to the wind my friend
She is everywhere",Requiem,1995
Trouble,"I told you the Bastards will pay
Maybe not yet, but they'll see the day
I told you, God tempth no man
And you know we've got to do what we can
I can tell me of you still can't see
When are we going to stop this misery

I asked the assassin, if he has the right
I hope someday, maybe he'll m the light
I asked you all, right from the start
Choose the way chat comes from the heart
I can tell some of you still can't see
When are we going to stop this misery

In these troubled times, you ask me
How can we be saved
Tell all the people, every one you meet
The answer is love

I told you 'bout the wickedness of man
To try and save him. I hope we can
I told you 'bout my, dream of love
And life that only comes from above
I can tell some of you still can't see

I'm bored out of my mind 
There's nothing much to do here
I sit around all day and wish that I was somewhere else

I don't know what I'd do with it

But the cat came back 'cause he wouldn't stay away.

He gave him to a boy goin' out in a boat,
And he gave the boy a dollar
Just to set the cat afloat
Well the boat tipped over and the boy drowned
Two miles away, they picked the boy up drowned,

[Chorus]

And he gave him to a man goin' up in a balloon
And asked him for to leave him with the man in the moon.
Well the balloon burst and back to earth it head,
Six miles away they picked the man up dead.

[Chorus]

And he took him to the butcher when the butcher wasn't around
And he dropped him in the hopper when the butcher wasn't around.
Well the cat let out with a horrible shriek,
And the town's meat tasted furry for a week

[Chorus]

Now old Mr Johnson lived all alone
Had an old yeller cat that wouldn't leave home.
He tried everything she knew
To make the cat go away.

Trout Fishing in America,"If you go out in the woods today
Be sure for a big surprise
If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise

For every bear that ever there was
Will gather there for certain because
Today's the day the teddy bears
Have their picnic

Picnic time for teddy bears
The little teddy bears are havin' a lovely day today
Watch them, catch them, unaware
And see them picnic on their holiday

See them gaily gad about
They love to play and shout
They never have any care

At six o'clock their mommies
And daddies will take them home
To bed because they're
Tired little teddy bears",Teddy Bear's Picnic,1991

I've got a box of old photographs
Mostly pictures of you;
And I never look at those pictures any more,
I guess you got your negatives too.
They're playing oldies on the radio,
Kick the clutch and shift the gears;
You can drive all night long,
But you can't get there from here.
Well there's a place I remember,
And I've been back several times,
Guess I was looking for something,
I don't know what I expected to find.
So I called you on the telephone,
And now it's painfully clear
We can talk all night long
But you can't get there from here.
Bridge: Do you remember the time that you
Told me you loved me?
And I knew I loved you.
Do you remember the time when
We said goodbye?
Well, you can hop on an airplane,
Or buy a ticket for a train;
You can take a trip all around the world,
But you can never get back there again.
Or hit the high-school reunion,
In your twentieth year;
Reminisce all night long,
But you can't get there from here.
Bridge:
I've got a box of old photographs,
And every image came true,
Funny, they almost told the future--
See, I'm not in the picture with you.
They're playing oldies on the radio,
Kick the clutch and shift the gears;
You can drive all night long,
All night long,
You can drive all night long,
But you can't get there from here.

Trout Fishing in America,"A Sultan sat on his oriental mat
In his harem in downtown Persia.

And he said to his servant Kersia,
""Aw curse ya', curse ya', curse ya',
That's the worst cup of coffee in Persia!"" 'cause

Chorus:
All I want is a proper cup of coffee
Made in a proper copper coffee pot.
I may be off my dot, 
But I want a proper coffee in a proper copper pot.
Iron coffee pots and tin coffee pots, they are no use to me.
If I can't have a proper cup of coffee
In a proper copper coffee pot,
I'll have a cup of tea.

In days of old, when knights and men were bold,
And whiskey was much cheaper.

And showed his pistols to the keeper
He said, ""Stand and deliver!
Can't you see that I'm all a quiver?"" 'cause

Am I having with you, sir?"" 'cause

Now King Solomon and his queen would carry on,

Trovante,"Foi sem mais nem menos
Que um dia selei a 125 azul
Foi sem mais nem menos
Que me deu para abalar sem destino nenhum

Foi sem graça nem pensando na desgraça
Que eu entrei pelo calor
Sem pendura que a vida já me foi dura
P'ra insistir na companhia

O tempo não me diz nada
Nem o homem da portagem na entrada da auto-estrada
A ponte ficou deserta nem sei mesmo se Lisboa
Não partiu para parte incerta
Viva o espaço que me fica pela frente e não me deixa recuar
Sem paredes, sem ter portas nem janelas
Nem muros para derrubar

Talvez um dia me encontre
Assim talvez me encontre

Curiosamente dou por mim pensando onde isto me vai levar
De uma forma ou outra há-de haver uma hora para a vontade de parar
Só que à frente o bailado do calor vai-me arrastando para o vazio
E com o ar na cara, vou sentindo desafios que nunca ninguém sentiu

Talvez um dia me encontre
Assim talvez me encontre

Entre as dúvidas do que sou e onde quero chegar
Um ponto preto quebra-me a solidão do olhar
Será que existe em mim um passaporte para sonhar
E a fúria de viver é mesmo fúria de acabar

Foi sem mais nem menos
Que um dia selou a 125 azul
Foi sem mais nem menos
Que partiu sem destino nenhum
Foi com esperança sem ligar muita importância àquilo que a vida quer
Foi com força acabar por se encontrar naquilo que ninguém quer

Mas Deus leva os que ama
Só Deus tem os que mais ama",125 Azul,2000

Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica

Num gesto que podia ser de amor

And she was telling 'bout how she feel and everything
Her name was New York
But she said Troy listen

She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on yo face
'Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

She like my style, she like my flows
It ain’t no chuck involved, she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain’t nobody sound like this
We ain’t the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips

She got the long hair, ain’t nothing fake
Flute glass full of birthday cake
All blue thong with the stars on it
Layin' in my bed and she all on it
Rewind back, before I grind the cat
Two steppin' in the club with my dogs all strapped
There for dough, playin' with the bitches
A flashy young nigga before we took the pictures
I can take ya number, can’t be ya man
But you can act like it in ya Instagram
I like flippin' grams and you like me
And if you into getting money baby you like me
Come on, I’m out here, sound the alarm
I heard one good girl is worth a thousand whores
One good song is worth a thousand tours
So before I leave, proceed wit yo boy

She said yo new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on yo face

We ain’t the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips

It's that NY sound, oh this that new NY sound
Puttin' it down for the town
I used to put them birds in and out of town
But look at me now

One brick at a time on the road to get mine
Spit about it in rhymes now the hustle combined
Pop I'm killin' these bitches I done stayed on my grind
Motivated by money and puttin' on time
To get busy, these other niggas been iffy
They callin' me young Jay, they call me the new 50
Call me what you want except broke, let's toast
Who the fuck I'm supposed to sound like, I'm from New York
Troy Ave got the streets in a frenzy though
I bought the spotlight back, you should thank me no
And if you don't, then we know you a hater bro
""A playa hater"" Biggie quote
I'm on the radio baby everyday, that's my word
I restored the feeling, I kept up my word
The new sheriff in town, the chuck is over

Troy Ave,"I know it's been a while since you heard it like this
The boy can't miss, Rolex on the wrist
Bezel on brisk, 'bout time the real returned, we still exist
Now you weirdos return to when you wasn't risk
Tight jeans for boys wasn't popular
Unless you was in the boy's, man, stop it, bruh
Too much fashion rats sayin' this and that
No clothes in facts, everybody's in the trap
But they ain't never sold no drugs, for really though
'Cause they was dead broke in they first video
YouTube don't lie, sort it like numbers
I been gettin' money for the past eight summers
Bought a Benz all cash, ho picked up a Hummer
And to think, we wasn't even twenty-oner
It's not a word, now you know how I feel when these absurd
Rappers talk about things that never occurred
Damn it, the nerve, you ain't never brandished a bird
Or guns on your enemies and gave them what they deserve
Let a nigga try me, they die, B
Ain't nothin' sweet, I be on it like diabetes
Givin' shots, gave in, was givin' props
Sometimes I had to take them in the form of blocks
Properly, buy and sell like Monopoly
No top hat, top back and she toppin' me
She bein' a vixen, all-star attender
Cake like my birthday, that's in November
23, I'm a Sage, I'm a swerve
Whole lot of horsepower, parkin' on the curb
Hoes want to floss out a coupe wit' a bird
Cold like the Porsche power, meetin' every word
I do this, might change my name to Brutus
Cut down the beef, now the money flow fluid

Bunch of Louis luggage, still your boy never trip
Gettin' chips, so it's only right I come through all dipped
Oppies get the lip and get a whole entire clip
Don't start nothin' and it won't be no shit
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it
I'm 'bout it, and I have no limit when I give it like, 'Uhh'

We made it, yeah, motherfuckers, we made it
I can't believe this shit
A hundred on the wrist, two hundred on the neck
Yo, five on the whip, three milli up in escrow
I been flippin' bricks since Nas was called Esco
(All eyez on me) like a nigga on Death Row
How to ring shots at niggas, the Bronx Lebanon
Draped in the bias, popped the seeds from Lebanon
Joe been a don, shit is realer than you think
Still ain't seen a nigga dive in a pool in a mink
Fuck you done to that shit? That ain't really chinchilla
This is Joey Crack shit, ain't a nigga been realer?
And I'm 'bout it, 'bout it everyday, three burners
Dare touch the powder, or you gon' see murder
Ever had a bitch bustin' off from givin' head?
Woke up in the Ritz, ten bitches in the bed
Niggas rockin' Jordans, but you ain't never meet the brother
You ain't that important, (shit, I still got his beeper number)
Medellin cartel, never leave a witness
Everythin' must go like you're goin' out of business
Trips to Dubai, bedrooms on the first class
Showers in the sky, reminiscenin' on my first pack
Far as projects, tryin' to get it all off
You can get it hard white, or you can get it all soft, it's cold

Bunch of Louis luggage, still your boy never trip
Gettin' chips, so it's only right I come through all dipped
Oppies get the lip and get a whole entire clip
Don't start nothin' and it won't be no shit

Runnin' through a bitch-nigga gauntlet

Cause when I throw shots bones shatter
Break 'em down, break 'em down, break 'em

I'm gettin' ninety-five percent off each
You only gettin' fifteen, that's the difference
I can match most of y'all wit' cars
Fucked half of you niggas' main broads
I spent three-fifty cash on a condo, that's large
Why you mad? It's not my fault
You rather dick-ride than to walk on your own two feet like a man

They actors, they should just act

I barely toked on gats, been a get-money nigga since scratch

You see me stylin' and you just want to parlay in some flicks
Man, you niggas be worse than these hoes and it's a shame
My VIP section is closed to your fake chains and your fake watch
Fake watch busters, look what we got
Another nigga tryin' to be who he not
Big cars and jewels, that's dope boy swag
You ain't street, you a bitch-nigga dressin' in drag
And it's sad, so sad how these junkies try to do you
I put your ass somewhere, boy, where nobody knew you
Don't forget, I'm the dealer, you are the user, but that's straight
I'm a get back to my meal off this Hermes plate
I'm almost at a mil, man, God is great all the time

Let me put it down for town

But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on your face
'Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

Now all you hear is New York this, New York that
Let's keep it real motherfuckers, I brought New York back
G-Unit in the stud' Dipset to, facts
I even got Ma$e and nine-five Puff on the track
Runnin' with the classic feel, nine-five max
Sneak diss, tweet this, no replies you wack
Tables done turned like a DJ gig

I brought the spotlight back, you should thank me no?
I'm coming up though my furs still on the flow
All my stones flawless you see me glow
Now here's what'll probably happen if you mad at this
You might get yourself shot, and make me fuck your bitch
Either way I'm bustin', to end all discussion

You ever made love on a G7?
Told the pilot don't stop till we see heaven
Harlem king with black features
You ever rode on white horses on black beaches
They clear ports we clear portals
Time travel, don't confuse us with mere mortals
You due slippin' we too cool for loose lippin'
Move different, pools on the roof patroose sippin'
Made your life different, blink you might miss it
Even though I hit it first time we kicked it
Who set up plays for you, who coached you in the huddle
Who's penthouse views make the ocean look like a puddle
And I love her cause shorty different
We be hundred and forty fifthin'
I'm just trying to call you my lady
I have you feeling like Harlem in the eighties

Two-forty on my odometer
I don't trick I pimp I give no gift but stick even on Hanukkah
She ask if I'm faithful, I say, ""I promise ya""
If I cheat I'm triple timing ya
'Cause Ma$e don't do no welfare
Pay for no health care, that's what you got Obama for
I got my CPs from CP, got my Yeezys from Yeezy
The chick with my umbrella she look like Ri-Ri
You don't believe me, you ask PD
Getting money for me too easy
I feel like Holyfield
I got them Brooklyn broads biting
Already got my cake I'm just here for icing
My nigga Cudda tried to school me to the game
We was balling so much they try to boo us at the game

And that TK went down smelling like some loud huh
Well fucking with your friend I did her foul huh
But even still she fuck me now if I'd allow her
I get the money and the power too much to resist
Ain't even menage with the broad and she take a pic, thirsty bitch
Tell her fuck you with a dirty dick
Up the asshole and ain't locked up yet you already lettin' that ass go
She said your case too complicated before trial
I had her eight more other ladies, you know how
Missionary, doggystyle I ain't with you though
No matter how you slice it our destinys in the writing
Written on the wall you fuck with them other guys and
You can stand to lose it all
Talking now it's enticing
Gave you somethin' paper gon' make you revoke your license

You know how we do, 
Catch a body then we go party
We used to be in billyway, church and jail 
 
Me and capone smoke weed till I burnt my nail 
I used to cut niggas faces 
Smoke weed out of bible papers 
The Knicks and the Lakers
See me with a Northface, facing the north
Drinking Schmirnoff and taking niggas face right off
N.O.R., and shit ain't really change that much 
Except I smoke a Philly can't fuck wit her guts
I eat aunties food, the best in new york 
Boneless chicken, and she don't cook no pork
I got some Chardonnay, nigga go and pop the cork
Me and Capone made up, everytime we fought

From out the dark into the lights on the streets
Slugs pop when slugs meet

Yo outlaw, hit me 1-6-0-9
Cock back and bust nines, this bitch nigga plotting on mom
My fam too, 'cause god niggas body your crew
Bitches will never come between the life of two
And ain't nothin gonna change but my age
My attitude is deep, I get it from my peoples in graves

Yo me and you, been together like tango and ??
Like Capone-N-Noreaga like the weed and hash
We stick together like coke, like we still sell drugs 
Bad seeds from the ghetto but we still get love
We just trying to make it, while other niggas fake it
We blow your cool like we chill now its time to take it 
Like you never had it, you don't deserve it 
Fake niggas getting jealous 
But these hoes be giving cervix

Real niggas selling that crack
Busting their cap, know what i'm saying?

Take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes. I still see your ghost

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

I don't keep love around
I don't keep love around
Ooh yeah, I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

They can't stand, I handstand
Don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall Flash Dance
Only A1 and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
Because failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I’m still sane
Right, because that's enough
When the light on and you don't keep love

'Distance makes the heart grow fonder'
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now?
Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep

I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrew

Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

Used to give each other the world, every bit
Used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trust

And I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
And feel myself turn to stone

Till the nigga rucked up,
This fine bitch had walked up.
I say what's your name, do ya got a name,
And since she crossing the street
Can a mack hold ya fuckin hand?
But this shit had fucked me up at first,
Because she smiled with a smurf and turned
Around and said that will work.
She was a perfect 36, 24, 36.
She had ass like a stalion bro.
She kept this muthafuckin look in her eye,
We jumped in a ride.
She started rubbin on a niggaz thy.
I put her to the floor,
Took of my shirt and my pance
And let my feet hang out the car door.
She said you're kinda fast, and I knew it.
I said ya like me,
I like you so let's do it.

See I'm a playa,
A pimp, so let's do it.

Thinkin bout this girl the and way she make me spit.
It feels kinda strange, because it's like I knew her,
But all I really knew was her name.

But she make me feel logic.
Now I'm in the sneakin, niggaz into creeping.
Hey p, man ain't that yo beeper beepin?

Let me call this girl back.

You know what I'm saying? hello? hello,

But I was thinkin and just wonderin how you feel bout me?
You know what baby I was thinkin bout you too.
You know what I'm sayin?
I like you a lot and I was hoping I could see you tonight.

I'm in this dice game.
Silkk got my 97, 211's coming out my hands.
I'm hating them bitch's like hoes.
But that was my girl so you know a nigga gotta go.
When niggaz started acting funny talking shit
Bout your one and only chance to win back his money.
I had to put this punk in line,
And when he turn his back I told silkk to pass me my fuckin 9.
Because I ain't the one to be fucked with,
And you know that the p don't take no bull shit.
But I live kinda strange,
But you know there aren't no fuckin rules in this fucking game.
But can't a gansta fall in love,
I don't know. because niggaz only serving fiends and thugs.

I gives a damn about you cum catchers
And I betcha thought that it was just another dog a bitch rhyme
But mia keeps it on her mind and I don't mind tryin'
A whole heap of niggas runnin' off at the pussy eaters
Sisters don't give a fuck about you and we damn sure don't need ya
Frontin' ass always tryin' clown
But be the main mother fucker havin' dinner downtown
Mounds of niggas talkin' 'bout who got a funky cat
But that's because the fact is that their nose be in the crack
Yeah reppin' on your dick bitch you needs to be smacked
Cause doin' that ride is like sittin' on a tic tac
Black mother fuckers always quick to trip
But know they came up on welfare and shit
Food stamps, medicade and commodities
Section 8 in projects so how you knockin' me
And claimin' you don't trip bitch you know you breaks me off
Before you give your boys or your messy ass moan
At salon shoppin' mall and nail shop here I go
Once my pussy hairs leave your teeth lookin' like a piano
So, I don't give a fuck about them niggas
Talkin' that shit cause you know you gonna pay a bitch
So playa you can talk what you want to yo niggas
But when it all boils down you know your
Bitch ass gonna pay a bitch
I said I don't give a fuck about you niggas

-all these niggaz dead we grew up with bro baby, daniel
-damn, bro, this shit daily, constantly happenin
-so what, we next or what?
-nigga, we tryin to come up and raise them little ones
-well, let's find a way out this shit
-well, let's do dat there

[master p]
Niggaz dat want to space age hustle
Catch that rocket to the fuckin moon
That be yo final ship, bitch, cause yo ass is doomed
Ain't no comin back, livin in the dope game
Cause once you die, nigga you slangin rocks, then that's yo name
On the wall when they run up,
I got killas coming trough with bubble ups to pick up double ups
And put him in that muthafuckin long black hearse
I mean, once you gone nigga you layin in the dirt
Ain't no love in new orleans,
All the way to richmond, california
Niggaz livin for ghetto dreams
And the ghetto get so crazy
I seen a little bitty baby suckin on daisies
Caught two to the chest, one to the head
5 niggaz walked behind him dressed in red
With ski masks, but niggaz thought it was a clown show
Witches in the st. bernard projects, downed a hoe
And it's sad cause niggaz claimin 3rd ward
9th ward and niggaz claimin 10th ward
All my homies be dyin down south
Run around, talkin shit, killas with gold in they mouth
But I'm a soldier, a rolla, give me ten
I'd rather die than go to the fuckin pen
My partna bos looked to my eyes and said, ""nigga
Is it time for change, niggaz ain't livin in this dope game""
So we jumped into this rap game
And laid it down to all my killas
That tried to teach my nigga the game
Cause once you gone, ain't no comin back
Talked to randall and t-dove
They say, ""p, the streets ain't all that.""
I mean the calliope projects done change
Right from roges tablet you find the fuckin police man
And niggaz still servin bubble ups
Big mo in the projects rappin, and niggas=z tryin to come up
And with this new wave dope game,
I mean this rap game, niggaz tryin to get out to make some change
But down south my homies dyin, niggaz fryin
But stories we ain't buyin

Chorus: repeat 2x

Who (2pac gone, but what rapper) gon be next
To take that final ride (I hope it ain't me who)
Get cashed like a bad check (slammin cadillac doors)
Black hearses when they should be 6-0's

[silkk]
I often wonder wonder if there's a heaven or a hell
Rest in peace to my niggaz that died
Too bad when they died they couldn't come back and tell
If they really is another side, I seen his mother cry
I just wanna know where he went when my cousin died
That last step, then it's yo debt, yo last breath
Then it's the moment you fear
Just think, by the day over, one of us ain't gon be here
Used to ride with a bunch of niggaz, now he's ridin solo
He's dressed up in a suit, when he used to wear polos
I wonder if there's a heaven for a gangsta, a killa, and a shoota
I wish some nigga gunned john gotti had went in the chamber
Moms say my days are numbered cause I live wrong
Even scarface made a song, gangstas really don't live long
I'm tryin to live to a rock candy painted cadillac like outkast say
Ride on them thangs like mack 10, from back side to side like u.g.k.
Convertible lexus like eightball, mjg
500 like my brother master p, I'm a shock the world if I see 23
Maybe not today, but tomorrow off into the funeral parlor
Take pause to bury my boy, as we roll up to the grave yard

Who gon be next...to take that final ride?

Chorus

[c-murder]
I done seen mo crime than a crime lord
Sometimes I sit back and think I seen more death than god
Just last week a nigga got shot up and burned
But me I take heed to shit like that, and I learned
How can I not end up like that nigga?
What the fuck I got to do not to get banged up by that trigga?
Cause in the projects, ain't no love
Niggaz will split yo wig cause they gon on drugs (her-oin)
I hope you feel me, cause I feel the pain of others
I feel for every nigga that got to go on without they brother
But like the game, what goes around comes around
Next week that could be your muthafuckin hearse ridin through that town
That could be yo mama cryin in that steeple
Better yet, that could be you mornin the death of yo people
In the hood, I'm known for peelin caps, so I'm a cap peela
The police know me for sellin drugs, so I'm a drug deala
I reverse the game cause ain't no love for a black man
13 years old, my little cousin got juvenile life for takin a stand
It's a never endin game of death, do or die
So if you kill, be prepared for that final ride

Chorus (2x)

R.i.p. 2pac, nigga, eazy-e, segram, mr. see
And my little brother kevin
Miller, and all y'all tru niggaz and bitches
That done died out there on these streets
And took that final ride
Y'all niggaz ain't forgotten
Cause tru niggaz live forever
Tru niggaz like us
Ya heard me? it's real nigga
We gon see y'all fools in the crossroads

I shouldn't rob a nigga , i might kill yah
See up on the block i rides deep on gold thangs
These niggaz be trippin up on my shit and they'll jack you like it ain't no
Thang
See I'm from the city where niggaz be salty and they stay faulty like wires
And i ain't seen a gangsta retire yet
On a bet , threw my cothes up on the floor and i sweat
Trust nobody cause these niggaz today will smoke you like a cigarette
Now bet , rest in peace to all homies that didn't make it
Took life for granted , an i panic while seeing niggaz with ski masks
We blast with ski masks and bust a cap into they weak ass
Everyday struggle and i stay hustlin like a pan handler

I'm 24 and since birth I've served hard time
In this concrete jungle , a war zone , many of my peers die
Finally made it back home
Self preservation is a thing for me
Duckin and dodgin bullets stone faces on the ones who pulled it

And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains
You know the name mia x the biggest momma
Ghetto sara lee at the store
Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho'
The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always
Tryin to get in the best players spot and knockin'
Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin
Throw in mo salt than martin
When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones
They try to get me slung on my back
Got to watch the jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin'
For all them crooks that be out creepin'

Pause for a second when I see the cops
Rocks of candy, whatever you wanna call it
But when I get you hooked, it's like a muthafuckin alcoholic

Candy I have move em fast like ? ? ?
Knick knack paddy whack, give a fiend a fast sack
9 times outta 10, he'll tell his friends and they'll be right back
Whole bunch a niggaz, and just one fiend
They come to me for less cut, cause I boast bigger cream
And them fiends come back cause they understand me,
I open up shop, open up shop cause I got candy

Got this ho that said she wanna suck my dick for candy
Gotta watch out for these dope fiends cause they be runnin tricks,

I keep a stash for the drought,
But the shit I sling daily in plastic out my mouth
My homies use code names,
Like l.d., big champ, slim, t dove, and big mann
I take penetentiary chances to make a livin,
Every 1st of the month, is like thanksgiving
Fiends hug me like they miss me
Hoes see me rollin in my car, and wanna be with me
I get my candy from california by the keys
Ship it in boats and trains back to new orleans
And open up shop like mr. rogers,
But sell mo hits than the dodgers
And fiends holla ""ungh!"" cause it's all good
From the triple beam, straight to the neighborhood
And when you sellin candy trust nobody
Cause niggaz even snitched on john gotti
Niggaz stay tru to the g-zame,
Never front on muthafuckin candy in the dope game
And never go to the fedz on ya folks
Cause punks get fucked with the soap

Yea son. Let me see this. Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son, 
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it. Son, the first question is, 
If you rap about another 

Rapper on a record, what are you? 

You a sucka! 
Aha, you got that right son. Next question. If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 
You mean like, you rollin in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you, 
The pigs be pulling you over cause you 

be black and you be sittin on triple gold, like the niggas in the ghetto be hatin on you cause you made it out? 

-Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 

-Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA. 

-Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test, 
But I got one more question for you. Son, if 
Any man depends on another man and can't think on his own, 
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

family, you know what I mean son. I mean, you were put in this world by yourself, 
You're supposed to depend on you 

and nobody else. 
I mean son, when a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man, son, what type 

of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 
Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy. 
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though. 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life. Fuck you hatas, cause we have millions.",Intro,1997
Tru,"Nigga, I'm bustin me locs, but I'm hittin em down with jokes
Y'all niggas on the rope, got your ho on da scope
Bitches watching me, jockin me, nigga blockin me, cockin me
Cause I'm the HARDEST motherfucker, out here rockin
I got the game in shades, got the niggas in blades
I got them hoes on a raid, because the nigga gettin paid
I've got, niggas from coast, slangin my dope
Got niggas and G's, and rollin keys keys to record sto's
Get paid wit fatals, niggas harder than Cato
Nigga turnin the tables, but niggas livin like potatoes
Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin
I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that
Down for whatever, niggas straight rowdy
Ask any motherfucker in America they'll tell ya, we bout it
Soldiers out there tech, bustin don't think
Lose ya life if you blink
Fuckin with them soldiers on the tank, cause

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Let's get ready to rumble, them niggas stumble
Hit em with left blows
Fuck it got death blows
Ready to got to war? Let's go!
We killas and realas, drug dealers and killers, fuck it
No Limit soldiers, close your eyes
Now picture me foldin dollar bills
I stay fuckin Tru, nigga fuck it, nigga do ya
Nigga I come to life and I scare all y'all bustas like Freddy Kruger
Gangstafied nigga, true to the game nigga
Stay fuckin pullin triggas, fuck up all y'all niggas
Cause I'm so fuckin T-R-U, representin I thought you knew
Cause killas killas killas
That's all I be around, nigga fuckin fool
About face, this No Limit soldier
One to the two to the three (hah hah)
Nigga I tried to told ya
Everybody quiet, while I load up this rifle (attention!)
Now all my soldiers start fightin
It's time to go deep cover
Lethal Weapon like Danny Glover, smother like jelly
Really, go deep like Jim Kelly
Fuck it, all y'all bustas open up y'all belly
Think we playin bitch, well we ain't
I heard we had drama motherfucker
Put up the Benz and now we drive the tank
Cause all I want to be was a soldier
All I want to be was a soldier, soldier

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

I'm a No Limit motherfuckin soldier till I die
We run this place, and I say the same shit, with a gun up in my face
I ain't scared to die, bitch like I said before, ho
3rd Ward, I'm from that motherfuckin Calliope
Projects supported worldwide by drug dealers
Transformin wimpy ass niggas into killers
Taking over, worldwide, doin shows oversea
Bringing bitches to the telly, put them hoes upon they knees
Gangstafied, like my motherfuckin homies Kane and Abel
No Limit, the world's number one fuckin rap label (worldwide)
Competition get smoked like we smokin blunts
I take a playa hata and knock out his fuckin fronts
Dope slanga, now I'm slangin CD's
A million records (platinum), it used to be some quarter keys
TRU tattooed on my back bitch thats my click
Ready to hop into some motherfuckin gangsta shit
I say No Limit loud, cause we ain't scared of nobody
Organized by P or should I say, John Gotti
Real niggas, put ya guns up if ya feel me
But if ya talk shit, bitch ya betta kill me
Like Skull I'm a hoodlum 4 life, I told ya
We be some motherfuckin No Limit TRU soldiers

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

187 khadafi
Jumpin' on ghetto dope with these gangster topics
Still makin scrilla
Your neighborhood drug dealer
Ice cream slaingin'
Tattooed up real nigga
In the rap game pushin' quarters
Flippin' the water, from texas to florida
Choppin' game to the knuckleheads
And spittin voodoo on the motherfuckin' chichenheads
Down south hustlin', to the west coast
Got nigga choppin' game, I mean this rap shit in to dope
Puttin' them in packages, independent spittin' shit
Standing on stages with bullet-proof vestes, lookin' for other cliques
But who gon' be the next nigga to die in this rap game
Or drop a hit on the wrong man?
'cause they talkin' shit about other niggas
Now it's a war zone, in this rap game

Ready to block like a football player
Got these 17 rounds for y'all haters
So jump on this ghetto shit and come get this wicked shit
And jump up on this rap game and watch a nigga spit

For runnin' my own shit
Niggas sellin' their company like the slaves sold their souls to 30 cents

Just keep it wild, so just pimp it on
I said just pimp it on

Mama gave me free game
Long before was I was true
Break Jhaz? Never, back it up
And break yourself, fool
Play my hand the tightest
Had this nigga think he bawlin'
(You ain't bawlin', you ain't bawlin')
Pinnin' never, yo
This Jhaz doin' the shot-callin'
People tendin' to think that
Women only gettin' tricked
It's ninety-eight why'all
And women out here now as pimps
Every women knows all men carry egos
Number one reason why they ass
So susceptible, feel me though
Make him think he all that, in fact
Use your talent: every woman born knowin' how to act
Female macks (female mackin')
Just tell this nigga what to do
Play it off like it's a question
At the end of it say, ""Boo, I love you, too.""
When I get through
why'all best believe we violent
'Til he break hisself, dog

Pimpin' ain't never been easy
For a lady until you met this new breed
Ain't takin' no shorts from these chumps
Make playas follow my lead
Got money to make with no intentions on settlin' for broke
Commitments from cluckers, countin' my riches
Call me 'Brina, pimpin' this bitch
Brothers gon' splurge on his last piece cash
He got (that's right) in his pockets
Keep bustin', but best believe no strings attached
So my ass gonna clock a sack
And stay by bein' in charge
I'm a play my cards to my advantage
Pimp niggas run the game and leave room
For me to use your scant-ass
You gonna treat me like a lady? (That's right)
The question is: is you gon' pay me?
You could front for ya balls
In reality we makin' babies
That's shadspspeecghey, knowin' behind doors
Only thing we do is sit and trip
Never once with that speech
Can we kick it on me, you're 'bout to hit
This pimpin' ain't easy, but I'm all about it
Straight pickin', keep clockin' so I'm strong
Better bring me all my damn money

There's two pimps on the scene for sure
And they pimpin' on
I say they pimpin' strong

[Jhaz]
Pimpin' never easy for a woman
It gets worse these knuckle-head-ass niggas
Only make my job the tougher;
Boy, you's a worker
So don't act funny 'bout my cash
Bring it home to mama
Before I eighty-six that ass, and do it fast
Don't play me like you didn't know
You's a male hood rat
How could you ever be my ho?
Really, though, I know
You thought you had me in a trance...

['Brina]
Goin' all out to please me
And want to be the one to get the pants
Understand: what's yours is mine
And what's mine and mine
Ain't got no time to settle down
Before you know it, I'm dippin' outta town
It'd be lyin' if it ain't about the money
Call me a gold digger
Don't be caught sleepin' try to run game on me, sonny
Pimps act is: attract niggas to females
But the catch is reverse roles
Keep male hoes on they toes in 'Brina's pimp biz

I got so many questions I don't know where to start 
[ Wellwhy don't you start from the pain that runs deep in your heart] 
(Is that you? God is that you? ....... It's me) 
Is there a heaven or a hell  if so is that theory true? 
[Yes my son] 
Why go through so much? 
[It's a test my son] 
So I guess it was you when ?? gave me the last second to run 
[Yes] 
And I don't know why I shed so many tears 
Forgive my God, I haven't been to church in months 
[Aww son you haven't been to church in years] 
Some times I rob, steal and kill, just to eat 
I popped him, I don't know if I killed him but somebody died in my building D 
[He's here with me] 
You think you can forgive me for my sins? 
If so hold up, another homie died ?? you think you can forgive me again? 
[I don't know] 
Some times I feel like death is chasing me but just ain't catch me yet 
I'm wondering if he is going to catch me when I stop to catch my breath 
They say days are cut shorter from the things that you did 
And if so then why take the kids? 
[Hold up, hold up my son] 
Huh? 
[It seems like some puzzle to you, if you got something to ask me, ask me] 
Why is it racism? Where did drugs come from? 
Why is it so much death where I live? Who idea was it to make guns? 
[Y'all] 
And why my grandparents was slaves? 
And why is is diseases with no cure like cancer and aids? 
Why is it rich and poor? 
Why is it a death row? [For real] 
[That was y'all I ain't have nothing to do with it that was never my will] 
And though I try and do everything, I just want to know if it is worth it 
[It was] 
Sometime I feel like I'm doing it all, sometime I just don't feel like I 
serve my purpose 
[Keep your head up] 
Nigga scared of the past 
All my homies want to know but scared to ask 
[Tell them to ask] 
God everybody for they self Sometime I don't feel like I'm all alone 
[Feel you] 
Don't worry bout me if I have to go so watch my brother them when I'm gone 
And what about when I couldn't pay my bills I was almost kicked out where I 
lived 
[I just wanted to see if you'll break] 
And everything happened at the same time 
[I just wanted to see how much pain you can take] 
And you must know my lifestyle 
[I do] 
Knowing I can't change my life 
[I don't want you to, do what you gotta do anything not neccassary you'll pay 
the price] 
So why did my homie die instead of me? 
[Because I had bigger plans] 
I don't understand 
[I'll explain, see I wanted you to grow up and be a better man] 
I want to know, how you determine who dies and who stays living? 
[The day I made the world my son, it was written] 
Look I gotta couple mo' questions I need to know 
[What?] 
God, can you tell me, when is it my time to go? 
(everything goes silent)

We shed all our hurt and tears (and tears)
No matter what the weather, what the weather
We were always togerther (always together)
We grew up as time went on
We became separated (seperated)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)

Kevin life ain't tha even tho we gots tah change
See momma don't understand how you died in tha game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he's a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for tha rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said ""P be strong"" with out you we all alone
I know its been a few years you your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Look, just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean I'm hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
And when you left, part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin shhh ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember tha last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton 'cause on your birthday I go and put flowers on your
Grave
I still remember when P and see broke tha news to me at school about your death
Told me ""Silkk time would heal our wounds""
It's been oh five years and I ain't healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong
I know moms tryin to hold on
Even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, that's why I can't move on
(It's somthing about you)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Now as I could remember (remember)
A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take tha pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson, could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood don't show that man no love
'Cause kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of you're real homies is wit ya
And its sad can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up 'cause when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)

Check this out, boo
The only thing that matters is if you happy and I'm happy
You know what I'm saying?
We know this real ghetto love
After the fronting and fighting, 
That's where the love making begins real good baby
But our friends ain't our friends
Your mama in our business, 'n' your sister in our business
The media in our business
These motherfuckers don't understand

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson:]
You said you're a friend of mine, it turned out you crossed the line
I forgive you I don't know why, you said you're a friend of mine
You said you're a friend of mine, it turned out to be a lie
I forgive you I don't know why, you said you're a friend of mine

[Master P:]
Call the cops for nothing, all the jumping and stunting
It should be kissing and hugging, I mean loving and rubbing
I'm on your team, you're on my team, I'm your king, you my queen
I'm the ice, you the cream, but your friends love the scheme
Even I told you you was special, see these hoes will sweat you
The niggas will wet you, but the ghetto is pressure
No more fighting in front of the kids, it's time to live big
Build a family tree of figs, and let the haters dig
You my rose I'm your flower, I think about you ever hour
Keep them hoes out our business, if you need me just holla

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg:]
I tell you all my problems, share my deepest secrets with ya
Hit ya on the side, girl you down to ride
I feel so safe with ya, get cha what you need
A condo in the valley with the keys, palm trees, jet skies
Fly you over seas, it's silly how we did it
Really we committed
I'm dippin' out the studio with the too faking 
My heart just uh aching, while I'm shaking and snaking
You tell me take a chance, so I dance with the devil
I kiss you on the cheek, and now we sneak into the bedroom
Tossing and turning, burning, yearning for love
And you supposed to be in love with my young 'cause
What's love got to do with this? And it's all based on friendship
Ain't that twisted, somebody told my boo and I think it was you
Had to be, 'cause I ain't heard from you or seen you, so it must be true

Eye blood red shot nigga smokin dank weed
And quick to slap a bitch in a minute
Fiends better have my money, I mean every penny
Youngsta, kickin with the hustlas
Fuck school, tryin to serve a clucka
And moms, wish she never had me
Cause I'm a nigga on the block slangin candy
Ready to die for this true shit
Takin penetentiary chances tryin to get rich
My role models frank nitti, scarface, and john gotti
Real gangstas, that's bout it, bout it

Chorus

Throw your muthafuckin guns up (tru!)
Cause I represent gangsta day (uh-huh)
A g-a-n-g-s to the t-a
Ain't lookin for no shit but if shit comes (what's up, what's up)
Ready to turn your muthafuckin body numb
And fuck the pen, cause if I go to jail again
I pop a plea, and I'm free, in 5 to 10 (outee)
A nigga talk shit so I banged and I step
Another notch upon my rep (killa)
Like the last tape a nigga say fuck you hoes,
Now I'm turnin bustas, into john does
I'm the nigga with tru upon my back (c-murder)
A gangsta that's strapped so you can't jack
Ain't nuthin but killas on my team, (soldiers)
And I'm hangin with the shocker and the ice cream
Beware, my mental status is flawed, (crazy)
Start bangin and muthafuckas get lost,
You got drama with this muthafuckin tru click? (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Big worm, this nigga need his wig split
Take him to the river, cut his head off (cut it)
Target practice for my goddam sawed off
That's how we handle shit, in my town
Cause gangstas make the muthafuckin world go round

Round and round you go,
Now tell me who's the realest muthafucka that you know
Black lucianio, hangin niggaz out the window

Winnin gun battles like geronimo
Say hello to my new friend, mr. mac-10,
With the infrared grin, I can't pretend,
Who I be, the s-e-are-v aka billy badgate
Jack you for your safe, with guns in your daughters face
Catchin chase for my case for murder, you ain't never heard of a

And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe   
Pac, jinte, the gats go pow
But my homies got caught up
Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money
that's why my heroes live for drug money

I watched em live fast, I watched em die slow

What you mean I need a hero
A hero is a zero to me
The only hero that I know is them niggas in my hood G
They gave me the game so I enhanced the gat
Than I took the game, and ripped it out the frame
I tried and told ya
A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me
that nigga MoXs on the Howard J G

And y'all other niggas that's still livin
That want to be a hero but can't be givin
Yo life up for these streets
But this goin out to my homies out there slangin D
That still hustlin in the game tryin to make it
But y'all niggas better realize you can't fake it
You either in or out ain't no halfway in
'cause when you die in the end you go to the pen
And its realer than you real niggas feel me
This for my niggas that are heroes in my hood G",My Ghetto Heroes,2013

All y'all gangster niggas
Y'all motherfucking gangsta bitches out there (the dope game) 
I'm a let y'all know something (welcome to the dope game)
Something that'll never end, this shit is going on like fucking numbers
Black on black crime, nigga it go like this here
We live an eye for an eye

You kill me, I kill you, my partners kill your partners
And you dead ain't no love on my spot
Me and my partners pushing rocks
Got them 17 round glocks at your ass spitting like loogies
We packing heat, 32 round clips, my automatic uzi
But I look into the eyes and I stare, I see death
Goddamn thinking ""the fuck?"", it could be me
My little homie on the ground crying
I'm thinking I'm gone, Oh my lord
My little homie Tony's dying (ripped his heart out)
He never had a chance to see his life glow
And he never had a chance to see his wife bro
And his little kid is only 8
It ain't about me or you motherfucker 
You gone peep defeat off the tree  
Cause you die and you murder, how could you live on the streets
And you never hurt, another nigga with a glock G
I'm thinking about Tic-Toc Boom, there goes another one
Send him to the moon
Ain't no rocket ship bitch, it's the temple of doom
I mean the ghetto, cause it's wicked
Most niggas out there in the hood, trying to get a chicken
But never even seen a bird
They die for that cain and that weed and they water
And they to fucking high, to see the enemy
Niggas that pretend to be, fools don't come close to me
Your best friend will kill you
I'm from that 3rd Ward, Caliope Projects 
Where they peel your caps like bananas
Police trying to stand on them buildings with them radars and scanners
But they can't stop the murders 
That's happening in my hood motherfuckers
Cause everybody study capping in this
Everyday, all day niggas dying, mothers crying
But y'all niggas ain't realizing that the hood is murder
Find your ass in a 6 inch gurder
Cause niggas banging like Charlie Chan
You'd better pack a piece nigga 
And welcome to the never ending game

The never ending game, (the dope game) the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep, or die on these streets
Cause the ghetto ain't no joke
Niggas in my hood everyday getting smoked
Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies
Y'all can't stop a nigga please, even if I'm dead G

Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up

Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold

Mounds of niggas talkin' 'bout who got a funky cat
But that's because the fact is that their nose be in the crack
Yeah reppin' on your dick bitch you needs to be smacked
Cause doin' that ride is like sittin' on a tic tac
Black mother fuckers always quick to trip
But know they came up on welfare and shit
Food stamps, medicade and commodities
Section 8 in projects so how you knockin' me
And claimin' you don't trip bitch you know you breaks me off
Before you give your boys or your messy ass moan
At salon shoppin' mall and nail shop here I go
Once my pussy hairs leave your teeth lookin' like a piano
So, I don't give a fuck about them niggas
Talkin' that shit cause you know you gonna pay a bitch
So playa you can talk what you want to yo niggas

Now I'm turnin bustas, into john does
I'm the nigga with tru upon my back (c-murder)
A gangsta that's strapped so you can't jack
Ain't nuthin but killas on my team, (soldiers)
And I'm hangin with the shocker and the ice cream
Beware, my mental status is flawed, (crazy)
Start bangin and muthafuckas get lost,
You got drama with this muthafuckin tru click? (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Big worm, this nigga need his wig split
Take him to the river, cut his head off (cut it)
Target practice for my goddam sawed off
That's how we handle shit, in my town
Cause gangstas make the muthafuckin world go round

[mr. serv-on]
Round and round you go,
Now tell me who's the realest muthafucka that you know
Black lucianio, hangin niggaz out the window
Like a fat pig and ? ferejano?
Winnin gun battles like geronimo
Say hello to my new friend, mr. mac-10,
With the infrared grin, I can't pretend,
Who I be, the s-e-are-v aka billy badgate
Jack you for your safe, with guns in your daughters face
Catchin chase for my case for murder, you ain't never heard of a
Nigga, with nuts big like bison,
Unified, gangstafied champ like tyson, world introducin
Young billy blast em up, I gives a fuck, all about my double up

See y'all true niggas
One reason I'm spiitin' this game to y'all niggas
Nigga cause 'I want y'all niggas to watch ya motherfuckin' self
Motherfuckin' f-e-d's be followin' niggas out in the projects
All in a niggas car, all on planes and boats
Just like deez niggas and deez hoes
Tired of motherfuckers followin' me man take another route
Nigga somebody else, keep ya eyes open fool

[Chorus: x2]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
I'm paranoid I can't sleep I'm in this dope game
I think these hoes and these niggas out to get me man

I ain't never had nothing in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid, I can't sleep cause I done stole a key
Peep out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie down stairs hollerin' 5.0
But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks
I got the a-k spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holler God damn, hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac
They said p where ya going man get in
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off while I do a trick
Take me to the project to meet my bitch
100 g's, 2 keys, and a bullet-proof vest, like
Billy the kid I got some pussy and headed to the west

Chorus

I was pullin up out the driveway
Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
But I saw him followin on the highway
And I today know that I'm gonna blast
See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted
And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

[Chorus]

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains
You know the name mia x the biggest momma
Ghetto sara lee at the store
Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho'
The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always
Tryin to get in the best players spot and knockin'
Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin
Throw in mo salt than martin
When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones
They try to get me slung on my back
Got to watch the jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin'
For all them crooks that be out creepin'
I feel they watchin' me

They watchin' but true soldiers don't die they multiply
Keep an open eye for all them haters

I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed

No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open

Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist

The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest

And everybody in the ghetto use nicknames 

Like V-90, Master P, Boz, and Big Man 

My little homies posted up 

some hang, hang, and some slangin' 

Others gang bangin' 

I'm tryin' to make it out the hood with this gangsta rap 

And stay TRU to the game, and put the town on the map 

But haters hate me and niggas try to talk shit 

Cause I done made, a dollar out of 15 cents 

On the curb, posted up with them bouldas 

And servin' fiends, A-1 yola 

And still tryin' stay true with my frist meal 

Cause in the ghetto, you got money, you might get killed 

And stayin' TRU to the game, is a part of life 

And if you don't player, you might lose your life

But politicians run for office 

They rather me bust a cap in a rat, cause they both gonna try and stop

When will it stop 

I guess when they leave me lyin' on the block 

With tears on my glock 

A pocket full of lemon drops, laughin' at crooked cops 

I guess I'm doin' what I gotta do 

As long as I stay TRU, until they put me through 

I know its a shame, things'll never change 

I hope I live long enough to see my daughter spell my name 

I'm TRU 2 Da Game

I dream of colours to be what i would be

Some real f'ing things going down low so,
Who lookin' for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here
Screamin' ""fuck the mayor""
He see the faces at the bottom of the welfare
They act like I'm somethin' to fear
Trapped in urban warfare
And pullin' triggers at a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild
That's drawin' 'em near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off
Still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere
Break the law, yeah

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
Who wanna challenge mine?
I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes
That's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spittin' them sentences
To senseless experience is the difference
You can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen
Still livin' but gettin' benefits
Put emphasis on hittin' my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that
Remember nights I used to sleep wit a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack and raid me
It took a week for that
Beat the rat, but you're sayin' ""look, he think he the mack""
Fuck yall!
Niggas who thinkin' they might try us
Watch us inside riots
Blue cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus, cops rush to brutalize us
America's polluted by lust
Who could I trust?
If I can't trust you, then I might touch you
If I ain't got love for you
Then fuck you!

Days are living fast, moves in misery

[P.O.R.N.]
Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Stars are made to shine

I’m in the double G, three-piece tux

Hope somebody call my bluff

Two queens is on my cuffs
Good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time
I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think
How do you find this upper echelon this time
Let’s toast to better days, a beautiful mind, and a flow that never age

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precedes me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies
Holdin' fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers
Rich but never famous
Hustle anonymous still remain nameless
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide right pursuers tried like
To no avail and a heroes what they died like
I’ve got em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
Not in the lime light or needed for the crime right
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line tight

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun
Have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese
Free falling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap for all the years
That we spent in luxuries lap
Without looking back
Cause memories could sting like hornet
Damn it felt good to see people up on it

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
how long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled 
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

A million handsome guys
With longing in their eyes
And all you had to do was pick the age, the weight, the size

Bring happy times

For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

True Image,"My sister, my sister, tell me what the trouble is
I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
so, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
there's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-are-O-be	-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dumb dumb and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
and you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

And they ain't got no problem spraying your ass, like disinfectant
So if I feel disrespected, I promise you family
Your body gon' be hollow tip infested
I come from the slums of the 212
H-Dub, Lennox Ave, fuck you gon' do?
We got wild clips duke, with things that'll hit you
And leave a hole so big your moms could put a whole wrist through
Homes, you don't want to push me there
To the point, I gotta leave you in a bush somewhere
Nah, you don't want to push me there
It ain't worth it, dog, homeboy you better - better, huh
Before I aim in you -- huh, it's real
You heard Millz real, and better believe it stupid 'cause --
Nah, come on, Slay you know who to holla at

Bomb up, as I conduct, this is Ang' furry, huh

And bake berry, the H jerry's is so sweet
So brief, aim's gone, in the building

That push the breathe, for the best to colide
Better yet, I put the X in define
Never fret, when it's beef, I put the pep' in the nine

So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man, True Mast', collabora-tion

[Chorus:]

Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs

[Verse One: True Master]

Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
And exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter

[Verse Two: Method Man]

Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
Or here lie, another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
To get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies
Turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, yo

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Prodigal Sunn]

I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth
I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mindstate
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?

[Verse Four: Hell Razah]

This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
? of Islam, keeps me calm
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
? , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I separate your Adam's Apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack

[Chorus]

[Johnny Blaze]
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice

We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you

Funny now there’s nothing left to say
We had our share of days in the sun
But we let the clouds get in the way

Who knew how high we could climb
‘Til we got to the top and we saw how far we could fall?
Now that you’re gone, it’s all I can do
To keep from losing it all

Tell me, what do we wish on now
Now that our star has fallen from the sky?
And where did we go so wrong in this love
And how do I kiss you goodbye?

Letters and cards, pictures of you
I never thought they would look so old
Must have been fools but we had it all
But it fell apart when our love grew cold

Standing with you in the rain
Only now in the end, can we drop
Our guard and be real wishing you well, watching you go
I don’t know how I should feel

Tell me, what do we wish on now
Now that our star has fallen from the sky?
And where did we go so wrong in this love
And how do I kiss you goodbye?

I still can’t believe that you’re gone
But, baby, my mind keeps telling me that we are through
And telling my heart to move on

And for choices made
There's a price I've paid

But God, I pray
That there's a way
To bridge the distance now
And get to me somehow

Lord, I'm crying out
I know You hear my heart
Once again I'm asking
Will You reach this far?

I need to see You
I want Your love to break through
Please let me hear You
I fall down at Your feet

I need to know You
Not just know about You
I need to feel You
In You I am complete

You're everything I'm needing
Everything missing in me

I'm all I'm meant to be

Believe that you were sent to set me free

And I am forgiven
Yes I know you are risen
And open up the door
Into to heaven
I m forgiven

What a lord you are, a savior full of life
Everlasting king of kings
What a price you paid, to save the souls that took your life
The very ones that you forgave
With your blood you wash me white as snow
And I don't worry where I'll go
No power can seperate me from your love

On a low-down Sunday afternoon;

Drowning in a sea of tears

Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns

Ludicrous, we speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo

On my never ending quest to get the paper on the caper

I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo

Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that

Top notch baby, never coming less

Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's the dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can the steps
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when the Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh

Junior High, do it fly, fuck in grade Summer school
Comin' through, get me drunk, blunted too, every month
Hundred shoes, every son, wanted jewels, never front
Got older, hunger grew, watched most the younger fools
Squat out from the guns they usin', not close to the most of them
Quarter rolls, microphones, one, two, revolution
Sons due, evolution, in a rhyme, ghetto music
In the mind, 'cause I'm movin, in time, intwine
Lines all out of ideas, thoughts expose the road
Painted pictures, mask very clear, like a spear
Fallin' from the atmos, my raps soaked in the pages
Kids I play with, different flavors, instant paper
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I just breathe, the breathe of life in the mics
Feel my notepads with sites, now, guide you like God did to Israelites
I just breathe, the breathe'll in whole tap
Into my cassettes, fate awakin' you, holdin' in like herb in your chest

Love our mothers, love our dads, sister drug out on that glass
You ain't mad when they ain't sell refer, jump out the window, chasin' Jesus
Hunt me in the garbage, told me, he's a prophet
Used to recite scriptures, and dust, now our skin poppin'

Sold it, soak in dreams, felt guilty but the feelin' passed
Learned to put, all my feelings in my past
Kids that had a thinking, took my books and bring
Gave you read, all these laws
Blow coasts, smoke spliff, old flicks, focused
Flip cake, chicks scrape, that's me, thick braids
Swift blade, in the pockets, sick days in the projects
Slick way, I'm the stocking cap, I just got in rap

Trummy Young,"Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies 'round this rockin' chair

My dear old aunt Harriet--in Heaven she be
Send me, sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rockin' chair gets it--Judgement Day is here
Chained to my rockin' chair

Old rockin' chair's got me, son, (rocking chair got you, father)
My cane by my side, (Yes, your cane by your side)
Now fetch me a little gin, son (ain't got no gin, father)
What? 'Fore I tan your hide, now, (you're gonna tan my hide)

You know I can't get from this old cabin (What cabin? Joking)

Trummy Young,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,1991
Trummy Young,"Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?

Trummy Young,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!","Just You, Just Me",1998
