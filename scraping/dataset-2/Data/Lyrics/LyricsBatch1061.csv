Sum 41,"So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction

So tell me what would you say
I'd say its up, to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance and Understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left? To stop the pleading
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the sickness

So tell me what would you say
I'd say its up... to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
Tell me, so

What have we done
We're in a war that can't be won
This can't be real
I don't know what to feel

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in",Still Waiting (Video),2002
Sum 41,"I've said this before no matter how hard I try.
I can't stop being bored while this world passes by.

So!
These people, they just have no meaning.
We've lost it all in hopeless dreaming.

Well I've just lost my grip!
Paint it black and just forget me.
This world just makes me sick!
Turn the pleading into envy.

I'm just stunned believing that nothing's to be said.
What are we achieving with the bull shit that was fed.
I don't want to hear what's said or live to see the dead.
Cause what comes to me is a resignation for me.
A resignation for me.
A resignation for me.

I've said this before no matter how hard I try.
I can't stop being bored while this world passes by.

Don't tell me what's wrong with something that we don't even understand.

My brain's just too hollow!
Some might say we're all to blame.
The outside's so unknown!
I don't want you to complain.

I can't find the answers to see through parity.
I can't find my anger.
It's a resignation for me.
A resignation for me. [Repeat: x4]",Mr. Amsterdam,2002
Sum 41,"Another day wasted out of time
I can't get out of this
Altered state of mind
I'm going overboard
My conscience meets decline
Into Reality
I know this can't be fine

[Chorus]
Cause I'm all messed up
Making prefect nonsense
Drowning in my doubt too well
Cause I'm all messed up
Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
So blind

Who are these voices in my head
I can't go on like this
Living like the dead
I haven't slept so long
Feeling sad I dread
I'm talking to myself
Forgot what I just said

[Chorus]
Well I hold my only enemy as closely as a friend
And I sold my own reality to further my descent

Self-destruction taking over it's so easy to pretend
Introduction to this nightmare may never end

Can anyone help me drag my heels
I'm running overtime
I can't hold down my meals
My mind is racing by
Staring blankly feels
Like pulling out my teeth
While this engine winds",A.N.I.C.,2002

I don't want to hear it
I found my way again
It's hard to explain it

I don't feel this could be real

Its so hard to find a simple reason

Nothing to lose
Cause when everything has fallen to the ground
Gonna knock it down
Just believe me when I tell you its alright

This time were on our way to tragedy
Forever bored and outside from the in crowd
I've come to grips with confronting my reality
Numbstruck its me against the world now

Sum 41,"Perfection is my direction,
Even if that's all I had.
It's not like I need no correction,

Sum 41,"What happened to you
You've played the victim for so long now in this game
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same

But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

Now I'm in over my head
with something I said
Completely misread
I'm better off dead
And now I can see
How fake you can be
This hypocrisy is beginning to get to me

It's none of my concern
Don't look to me because I don't believe in fame
I guess you never heard
I've met our makers they don't even know your name

But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'

Now I'm in over my head
with something I said
Completely misread
I'm better off dead
And now I can see
How fake you can be
This hypocrisy is beginning to get to me

This came long before
Those who suffer more
I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare

What's with my disgrace
I lost the human race
No one plans for it to blow up in their face

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces
Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces

Now I'm in over my head
with something I said
Completely misread
I'm better off dead
And now I can see
How fake you can be

A time that's way too old

Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right

Sum 41,"[Unwritten Law]
Remember when, I was ten, 
Lookin forward to Christmas again, 
Everything, I enjoy, 
Like the family Christmas tree and the toys, 
And I?d wake up early morning 
While mom and dad still snored in bed, 
So I crept, down the steps,
Couldn't wait to see what Santa had left now

[Chorus]
I could not wait for Christmas day,
Wait for Christmas day now

[Unwritten Law]
Don't want to wait, gettin late, 
March up stairs to give my parents a shake, 
Get out of bed, sleepy heads,
Christmas doesn't start till you are awake, 
As we gather around the tree 
I open everything they gave to me, 
So I stay, end up late, 
Why can't it be Christmas everyday now

I could not wait for Christmas day, 
Wait for Christmas day now, 
But I, but I, will have to wait for Christmas,
I will hafta wait for Christmas,

Not naughty 'cause, Santa knows karate, he's on the cross Vader, 
Hip hop hoorayder , got wade on the beats,

Or bad like the Beev, only Santa know the score

Sum 41,"Nevertheless am I dressed for the occasion 
It's number 32 now here's the situation 
If the beat moves your feet then don't change the station 
Now pack your bags cause we're leaving on a permanent vacation 
Well, I'm a disaster 
A microphone master 
Put on your tape and rock your ghetto blaster 
It's not about the money, cars, hotels, or resorts
About sweating all the bitches in the biker shorts 
I'm Dave Brown Sound and you see me running late 
Cause I'm always making time to make your girlie feel great 
And I'm Bizzy D from way down town
I'm known to rock a mic like a king was a crown 
When I'm on top I'm gonna borrow that bootie 
Hustling deals like Mickey Macoote
When I wake up I like a pound of bacon
Start off the day with my arteries shaking

[Chorus: x4]
Rock! It's what we're all about
It's what we live for
see'mon shout it out

Well I bring down the house in every city we play
Just from pickin' up the mic' in a usual way
We rock guitars with a bass that's funny
We could even tear it up at a grade school party
Well I can keep the beat but I can't break dance
It's hard to look cool in crazy pants
But I wear 'em anyway even when they look whack
It's my personal way to bring the 80's back
Gave up the life of servin' burger and fries
High cholesterol gettin' grease in my eyes
I was drinkin' underage I belong on stage
Hello rock 'n' roll goodbye minimum wage
I'm teachin' you a lesson in mic' control
Makin' rhymes with my letters in my cereal bowl
Lucky number seven every dice I roll
Sum 41 to the power as the poon patrol

[Chorus: x4]

Well let's avoid confusion by makin' one thing clear
The rock we're bringin' is gonna instill fear
and the power we control should be revered
We sold our soul to Satan two times last year
Take a look to the point, to the point I'm makin'
We rock the oven when we're stone cold bakin' 
And we get outta hand and bust up the room
JD is to blame for the Legion of Doom
'Cause I'm the B-I double Z-Y
You ain't better than me, I ain't your average guy
I like to watch girls shake with a kung fu grip (wah)
Well the goon platoon is on the flavor trip
We beat down London, we slayed LA
Got an APB on the jams we play
So when you're on the stage cold grabbin' your cock
Pledge allegiance to the sum the new kings of rock

But I say we need an exorcist

Under God and above us all

Im Fernsehen seh' ich Leute, die schon alles haben
Ich mach' sechs Kreuze, verlier' 'ne Wette
Und denk' an all die schönen Dinge, die ich gerne hätte
Und manchmal in der Nacht träum' ich von 'ner Yacht
Fliege weit, weit weg in 'nem eignen Jet
Doch wenn ich ehrlich bin, dann brauche ich das nicht
Denn das wär' alles nichts wert ohne dich

Ich feier' uns so, wie wir sind
Wir sind keine Royals oder Kings
Doch dafür sind wir frei, wir sind niemals allein
Wer braucht 'n Rolls-Royce oder 'n Schloss von Versailles?
Wir sind so, wie wir sind
Wir sind keine Royals oder Kings
Unsre Omas nicht Queen, müssen Konten überziehen
Doch ich find', alles stimmt, ganz genau so, wie wir sind

Ich feier' uns so, wie wir sind
Ganz genau so, wie wir sind

Sie feiern meine Tracks (Tracks), meine Zeit ist jetzt (oh)
Scheiß auf eure Propz, ich zeig' keinerlei Respekt (no)
Brennen lichterloh, wenn Cem ein bisschen flowt (yo)
Keine Konkurrenz, denn mein Level ist zu hoch
Die falschen Worte sind tödlich (tödlich)
Ich komm' mir vor wie ein König
Farid sagte, „Nimm dir Geld, Bro!“
Doch ich hab' den Vorschuss nicht nötig
Damals noch 'n Haufen Sorgen
Heute will ich mehr als nur ein Haus und Porsche (skrrt)
Ich versuche auszusorgen, now we're talking

Ich feier' uns so, wie wir sind

Ich feier' uns so, wie wir sind
Ganz genau so, wie wir sind

Alle fragen, wo will ich hin
Doch ich feier' mich so, wie ich bin
Heute läuft das Business von allein
Bin immer noch nicht reich, doch hab' das Million-Dollar-Smile
Million-Dollar-Smile, nur noch Sonnenschein (yeah)
Weil sogar der Bankdirektor mich willkommen heißt (huh)
Million-Dollar-Smile, Hits auf Spotify (jaa)
Um Rolls-Royce zu fahren, musst du kein Royal sein

Million-Dollar-Smile, Million-Dollar-Smile
Um Rolls-Royce zu fahren, musst du kein Royal sein
Ganz genau so, ganz genau so, g-g-ganz genau so
Ich feier' uns so, wie wir sind

ich hab standhaft gefastet der Mann ist bewaffnet
er kam aus der Klapse wer will mich ficken?
und ich frag ob ein neuer überzeugt hat
du bist ein Hurensohn rap bei Feuer über Deutschland
Amerikas feind und ich ficke eure Botschaften

E-e-e-e-ey
Der Grund dafür dass deutsche Crews jetzt enttäuscht sind,
Weil sie in die Staaten wollten, wie der Flug 93
Meine Kugeln sind teuflich, weil auf dein Cap New Era steht,
Fühle mich sexuell erregt, wenn ich ein Gangsterrapper seh
Asphalt Massaka 2, der große Hype,
Man trifft euch im Fundbüro, weil ihr verloren seid
Mutterficker, ihr habt Paras, weil ihr euch Hero gabt,
Und Filme fahrt/Fard wie der Kameramann von Terrorbars
Von Tag zu Tag sinkt das Niveau von einem Bettler tiefer, doch das ist mir egal, denn ich hab im Bett Latifah
Deutscher Rap ist ein Schlachtfeld; Farid hat Hunger, und isst/ist Snacks (Snaga)
Wie der Rapper aus Gladbeck

Du machst Rap für Kiffer, meine Hörer sind Hoes,
In körperbetonten Burberry-Hosen
Es ist Kollegah der Macdaddy,
Rapper mit dem Black Cadillac
An der Westside von Germany posend
Ich verkaufe das Koka, deal am Block, während dein Team paar Trottel sind, traurige Poser,
Die zu Hause auf dem Sofa mit Shisha hocken, und Fifa (Vieh ver-) zocken, wie Bauern beim Pokern
Du Häufchen Elend, mit Säuglingen ähnelnden,
Mickrigen Armen, chillst mit Kräutertee und Räucherstäbchen
In deinem Billigapartment, nichts schlimmes ahnend, und Däumchen drehend,
Wirst unverhofft, umgeboxt, stehst dann nicht mehr auf den Beinen, sondern unter Schock,
Kid, ich komme und führe deine Freundin in die hohe Kunst der Blowjobs ein und gebe der Nutte Cock,
Und du Bitch sagst: ""Fuck auf Bullen!"", aber solange wir in deiner Stadt chillen, hast du eins eins schon gewählt, und den Finger an der null,
Ey, das ist Hustlerrap, ich mach mein Cash, verticke in deiner City jede Nacht das Crack, koche es, und dann wird es in den Straßen abgesetzt, wie Taxigäste

Ich steige mit Kumpels aus dem A6,
Nehme dir Hundesohn dein Gras weg,
Ein osmanischer Tokat, was jetzt?
Bungalows und Barchecks,
Sitz mit Onkels im Cafe, und schaue zu wie mein Vater Fünfhunderter auf Schwarz setzt
Du hängst mit Abschaum,
Rauchst deinen Joint, und hast Pappmaul
Ich komm nachts raus, mit 8 Frauen,
Die genüsslich an meinem Sack kauen,
Ich ficke deine Lache denn ich tickte Weiß und machte
Para, als Savas noch einen Mittelscheitel hatte,
Damals, als man mich täglich noch am Block finden konnte,
Ich mein die Zeit als Curse sich noch nen Zopf binden konnte
Sag wie willst du Junkie dich in mein Geschäft einbau'n?
Hol die Papers, halt die Schnauze, du kannst mir ein' bau'n

Als ich geboren wurd' sagte Gott zu sich, man der wird mal ein böser Mensch sein,
Heute fick ich Weiber, und creme mir den Schwanz mit Löwensenf ein, rolle ihn aus mit Kabeltrommel
Flagge aufs Gesicht, ich fick das Vaterland und salutier wenn ich auf die Fahne komme
Ragazzi ah!
Schreit besser, weil es reicht nur ein Treffer
Denn ich schmeiß Messer auf euch schweinehässlichen scheiß Rapper,
Reihenweise schneid ich euch Scheiße in Scheiben, so wie ein Häcksler,
Nein besser, mein Sippii gleitet vorbei, wie Clyde Drechsler
Als kleines Kind war ich mal ein süßer Kacker,
Doch mit 13 Jahren hat' ich 'nen Schnurrbart, sowie Müslüm Baba,
Denk ruhig du wärst hart, doch dein Leben steht auf der Kippe,
In kalten Zeiten bleib ich hart, so wie ein Nippel auf 'ner Titte

Der Junge der nicht tanzt, gesunde Arroganz,
Das Alphatier spricht und alle Hunde haben Angst
Ich kenne keine Furcht, glaub mir, ich greife durch,
Ich will 'ne Frau die Whisky schwitzt und Hunderteuroscheine furzt
Komm vorbei, wir klären das Ganze alleine,
Frauen und Geld hab ich, aber Angst hab ich keine, Ghettoromantik
Ich steck den Schwanz in die Scheide,
Mein Tascheninhalt sorgt für tanzende Beine
Ich bin nicht Max Herre,
Doch Weiber lieben mich, weil ich mir vor dem Fickengehen meinen Sack kämme
Jungs aus der Unterschicht, ihr Bonzenkids habt keine Klasse,
Und feiert impotente Scheisse für die breite Masse,
Seitdem ich rappe, brauch ich keinen Plan B,
Ich schlag dir die Zähne aus, und ficke anschließend die Zahnfee",Terrorbars Infinity,2010
Summer Cem,"Ich ficke die Nutten die denken sie können jetzt blasen
Und müssen nicht schlucken
Denn wenn ich im Club bin
Dann will ich die Flaschen sehn
Ey siehst du den Haftbefehl
Für was willst du hier Wache stehen
Wenn der Kanacke Waffen trägt
Buenos días, Matthias fick die Quanten-Physik
So kommst du nie in 'ne Disco du Asylantengesicht
Sag mal wer hat an der Uhr gedreht
Denn endlich ist es Summertime
Deine Ma lässt heißes Wasser in die Wanne ein Babe
Ich find deine Rundungen schön
Doch ich bin Keiner der dich dafür rundum verwöhnt
Jetzt ist der Mythos am rappen, ey sag mal ist das Sperma
Oder hast du Nutte grade Gyros gegessen
Denn ich spupupupucke diese Wörter im Takt
S-U-Doppel-M-E-R Nutten suchen Körperkontakt
Was für'n Palaber du Clown, ich komm mit Arabern die hauen
Laber nicht, zieh mal lieber deine Armbanduhr aus
Summer Cem und das hier ist mein Eingangstitel
Weil ich ab heute diese Szene im Alleingang ficke

Es hieß es wird mal einer kommen wenn der Zeitpunkt perfekt ist
Viele kamen vor mir doch die Eins kommt als letztes
Plötzlich wird dir kalt als ob die Heizung defekt ist
Ihr wolltet mir nicht glauben doch die Eins kommt als letztes
Klingelingeling auch wenn die Leitung besetzt ist
Du kennst die Nummer denn die Eins kommt als letztes
Ich hab's gesagt es gibt kein Grund zur Skepsis
Fünf, Vier, Drei, Zwei die Eins kommt als letztes

Salz in meine Wunden, Gewalt und ich sind Kumpels
Eyo ihr kleinen Bitchs eure scheiß Disses halten mich nicht unten
Das ist Kinoreifer Shit, so wie De Niro, Guy und Pitt
Und ich schieße weiter kiloweise Nitro, Blei und Gift
Die Ollen lieben meinen Mist doch ich feature keinen Fisch
Und ich liefer weiter miesenweitern riesengeile Hits
Und während du Pisser nur pleite bist
Zeig ich dir wie man die Scheine kriegt
Doch vorher muss ich strullern zeig mir mal den Kiefer deiner Bitch
Jetzt bist du Penner voller Frust doch das Beste kommt zum Schluss
Ich fahr die S-Klasse all die andern Rapper kommen im Bus
Denn dein Konto hier wird kontrolliert verzichte auf Geld
Und wenn du mit mir ficken willst eyo dann fickst du dich selbst
Ich hab die Gangsta im Rücken du hast die Gangster im Nacken
War schon im Kindergarten frühreif wie Benjamin Button
Ey und dieses Album es bleibt als Vermächtnis

Rheydt-Wester Bundeswehr, wo kommen all die Hunnies her
Wenn du in meiner Liga fickst brauchst du keine Gummis mehr
Partys in der Limousine, Nase voll mit Vitaminen
Schau mich an du siehst, dass sich die Straße in mir widerspiegelt
Mich muss man nicht lieb haben, mich kannst du nach Weed fragen
Du würdest gern Jeep fahren, doch das ist kein Mietwagen
Lass dir nix vorgaukeln sieh die Rapper über Bord laufen
Ey ich lasse meine Eier in den Schock schaukeln
Jeder will dir was zeigen Labels die dir Platz weisen
Suchen Gespräche doch ich reagiere abweisend
Stehe früh auf mit einer dicken Morgenlatte
Denn was ich gestern noch getan hab ist mir morgen Latte
Es gibt keine Warnschüsse MC's suchen sich ein Image
Doch ich suche immer noch den Generalschlüssel
Meinen Namen kennt ihr denn er bleibt im Gedächtnis

Ihr wolltet mir nicht glauben, doch die Wahrheit kommt ans Tageslicht
2010, Deutscher HipHop wird in Arsch gefickt
Deutschland, ich will eure Mittelfinger sehen
Eure Mittelfinger sehen, eure Mittelfinger sehen

Ey, alles was ich will, ist Hugo Boss und Donatella Versace
Tausende Euros und einen Dönerteller mit Raki
Denn die Straßen, die Ghettos, von denen wir zwei erzählen
Sind wie Frauen in der Schwangerschaft, denn sie haben keine Regel
Und während Öko-Rapper wie Marteria auf Sieben gehen
Frage ich mich, wovon der Penner Reason lebt
Gas, Wasser, Strom und wie es um die Miete steht
Ob er das Merchandise macht oder die Fliesen legt
Ihr kommt mit Schwächlingen, ich komme mit Häftlingen
Die die Zelle schließen und dich zum oralen Sex zwingen
Deine Fans schreien „Cem, kopf Hoch du Spinner
Die Hauptsache ist, du bist nicht gottlos wie Silla!“
Rapper wollen Smalltalk wie Letterman und Oprah
Doch ich muss leider kacken also pass mir mal dein Poster
Setz dich doch aufs Sofa, mach Geschäfte mit dem Koka
Und das geht reibungslos so wie Sex mit einer Oma

Alter fick auf Rap, ich bin back im Drogengeschäft
Und mache Kohle mit Pep, Schore und Crack
Zahl' im Rotlicht für Sex, werd' als Killer gesucht
Und ihr wisst, dass ich zäh bin, wie der Finger im Fuß
Als ich noch Straßendieb war
Sahst du den Dietrich im Schloss,
Als wäre er ein Adeliger
Und als ich Gras gedealt hab, mit dem Messer in der Jeans
Wollten Rapper noch kein Beef mit den Gangstern aus der Street
Ruth Moschner ruft an, denn sie hätte gern nen Gee
Kurz darauf bin ich bei Ruth wie der Backup von Massiv
Deutschen Rappern das Leben mit ner Kugel nehmen
Is ein Kinderspiel wie Reise nach Jerusalem
Souverän werde ich dich Hundesohn wichsen
Ich geh zum Grab deiner Mutter um die Nutte zu ficken
Denn Papa wartete auf mich nachdem die Cops daheim waren
Mit dem Gürtel in der Hand wie Boxweltmeister

Während ihr nach den Sternen greift wie Ninjakämpfer
Fick ich Kinderschänder, ich bleib' für immer Gangster

Und da diese Prominutten gerne vögeln und Schwanz saugen
Fick' ich Gülcan und lasse sie Brötchen bei Kamps kaufen

Gerade raus aus dem Knast, wird das Rauschgift verpackt
Ich bin dein Idol, weil ich keine Ausbildung hab'

Ey, jetzt kommen die beiden Ticker, wir haben die Scheine sicher
Denn du liegst nur auf der faulen Haut, so wie Leichenficker

Das ich hundert fahr' in der Dreißiger-Zone
Da leg' ich Wert drauf, wie auf meine Schreibtischkomode

Ey ich habe die Schore mit meinem Freund Ismet im Angebot
Doch du bist im Real und fragst „Is' Mett im Angebot?“
Und im Sommer fährst du Segeln mit nem Wohnwagen
Doch was meine Kindheit prägte
Waren die Schläge mit dem Stromkabel

Farid trägt Waffe, C-Klasse, was willst du Pimmel
Denn wer nix zu verlieren hat, der kann nur gewinnen

Feierabend Mutterficker, wir sind mitten im Geschehen

Und bin nur auf dem Holzweg, wenn ich auf Parkett geh,

Du Penner kommst im missratenen Mazda. Summer, der König, der Capo, der Chief, deine Frau sagt, sie habe mich lieb. Es gibt kein Beef, keiner bumst mein Team, komme mit Jungs, die mit deiner Gesundheit spieln. Mit erhobenem Haupt hab ich Drogen verkauft, doch hier is mein Album der Ofen is aus. Ey, Lady Ray hat einen Sexy Arsch doch is ne Bitch die mit Schlägern kommt wie Steffi Graf. An alle Frauen, Cem hatte es mit euch nicht leicht, denn er musste früh erkennen, dass sein deutsch nicht reicht. Ich lege Wert auf Körperpflege und auf Häuslichkeit, mein Schwanz ist wie Nivea, er spendet Feuchtigkeit. Du machst auf Talibanen- Tracks mit deinen Radikalen Raps, doch bist eigentlich ne Fotze mit Vaginalinfekt. Mein Körper entspricht nicht dem optinalen Bodymaß- Index, trotzdem krig ich deine Mum durch meine assiart ins Bett. Ey, fick die Cover- Girls, ich weiß, dass ihr Summer hört.

Hey Summer, wie gehts?
Danke gut, ich habe kranke lust, laufe mit dem Ballermann auf den Beamten zu
Wieso machst du das denn?
Weil der Hundesohn auf Kante tut, gestern Nacht noch hab ich deine Tante besucht, doch keine Sorge man der Schlampe gehts gut
Step in die Booth und misshandel die Crews
Doch bin leider immer noch nicht relevant für die Juice
Ey, dieses Jahr geht ihr leer aus, gestern Tanja, heute Tina, morgen gehe ich mit Lea aus. Damals holt ich die Notebooks aus dem Alianzgebäude, doch Bullen kamen und drückten mich und Ali ans Gebäude. Jetzt sitz ich im Auto und hör Königin der Nacht und frage mich nehm ich heut lieber den Föhn oder das Wachs. Mein Talent in der Schule konnte ich nicht umsetzen, denn der Lehrer meinte immer komm du musst dich umsetzen. Und genau aus diesem Grund verhaute ich die Schulnoten und mein Zeugnis, es sah aus wie ne Stuhlprobe.

Summer Cem,"Ihr Name war Anabell , doch sie hört auf den Namen Aisha
Sie liebte den Namen denn den bekam sie von Isa
Isa war weder Schläger noch ein Dealer
Nur ein Junge der sein Abitur macht und kurz vor dem Ziel war
Er wollte Arzt werden Inschallah Hoffentlich
Und sprach so gutes Deutsch das selbst der Lehrer aus den Socken kippt
Aishas Vater Frank der eigentlich ein Trottel ist
Vertraute Isas langem Bart und den Locken nicht
Aisha das Mädchen das man nie auf Partys sah
Verliebte sich in den Jungen aus Afghanistan
Das letzte mal vor 10 Jahren die Heimat gesehen
Er war gläubig und verpasste nie ein Freitags Gebet
Doch Isa macht ihr klar sie sei zu nichts verpflichtet
Denn nur wegen ihm hatte sie auf Schweinefleisch verzichtet
Von anderen wurde sie aufgezogen
Weil sie kein Bock hatte sich auszutoben
Denn nur für Isa hat sie sich aufgehoben 

Es ist schicksal, Es ist kismet
Mal bist du oben mal am Boden und du frisst Dreck was für eine kranke Welt
Sie hat doch nichts angestellt
Alles nur damit sie ihrem Mann gefällt
Oh Aisha
Nie wieder Partys und Feten
Salami und Bacon
Haramoaleykum
Warst du zu naiv oder einfach nur verliebt
Oh Aisha ich hoffe das du uns vergibst

Es war Anabell die Jüngste Tochter von Familie Klein
Papa Manager, Mama intressierte Malerei
Isa hingegen wohnt nicht grade in einem Traumhaus..
Papa Fabrikarbeiter, Mama Hausfrau
Seine Eltern waren eher konservativ
Und wollten nie das er sich in eine Blonde verliebt
Doch aus Liebe zu Isa konventiert sie zum islam
Und das obwohl Familie Klein nicht viel hielt von dem Koran
Öf und an Ramazan fastet sie geheim
Sie sagt, ich habe keinen Hunger, Mama lass mich jetzt allein
Aisha sagt diese Liebe hier hält Gott zusammen
Und für meinen Mann ziehe ich auch ein Kopftuch an
Keiner wollte helfen, keiner wollte es einsehen
Sie taten doch nichts Schlimmes, doch mussten sich geheim sehen
Und sie wurden schwach sie konnten nicht mher länger
Mitten in der Nacht und dann hat er sie geschwängert

Es ist schicksal, Es ist kismet
Mal bist du oben mal am Boden und du frisst Dreck was für eine kranke Welt
Sie hat doch nichts angestellt
Alles nur damit sie ihrem Mann gefällt
Oh Aisha
Nie wieder Partys und Feten
Salami und Bacon
Haramoaleykum
Warst du zu naiv oder einfach nur verliebt
Oh Aisha ich hoffe das du uns vergibst

Nach 3 Wochen war die Schwangerschaft bestätigt
Und Isa wurde klar jetzt ist er erledigt
Also ging er zu seinem Vater und fragte ihn nach Rat
Doch der Vater sagt, „Haram ab nach Afghanistan“
Isa ahnt was kommt und verflucht sein Leben
Ruft Aisha an und sagt, alles wird gut, mein Baby
Er verspricht ihr den allerersten Flug zunehmen
Wenn er zürück ist, ziehen sie in eine gute Gegend
Doch er konnte seinem Vater keine Widerworte geben
Und arrangierte Ehen waren in ihrem dorf die Regel
Er wusste von der Tradition doch hat er sowas nicht erwartet
Zwangsehe mit der Cousine 3. Grades
Und als Isa aus dem Flieger steigt, sieht man Aisha weinen
Gott sei dank, endlich kommst du wieder heim

Doch bemerkt dann seinen Ring am Finger",Aisha,2012

Geh mit deiner Visakarte shoppen und du unterschreibst

Steige in den Jet und fick in Katar Ina

Mache Cash mit der Mentalität von Michaels Vater
Sitze im Café mit Babbos aus Batman und Muş ili

Hör durch den Streifenwagen Funk BTM (BTM)
Ich greif zu meiner voll verchromten Knarre unterm Sitz
Schieb die BGB in den Player, voll relaxter Amoklauf
Die Frontscheibe platzt, guck, der Bastard verpasst knapp
Ramm ihn mit der Motorhaube, Rest in Peace, kratzt ab
Alarmstufe Rot, entweder Knast oder Zaster
Es fließt durch die Street und explodiert wie Magma
Gib dem Penner die Platten, wir sind Schwarzkopf-Kanacken
Die euch mit den Fahrradketten eure Schädeldecken knacken
Deinen Eierstock brat ich auf der Polizei-Haube
Ich spritz mit mei'm beschnittenen Schwanz den Illuminaten in das Auge
Deiner Mutter 'nen V12 Motoblock ?
Gebärmutter wird ?  Meine Kahba
Ihr habt 'ne Sturmmaske an und 'ne Gun in der Hand
Aber leider macht euch HDF nicht zu 'nem Mann

Ey, was du willst, ist bedeutungslos
Kleiner Pic, nimm die Fäuste hoch
In meinem Block ist der Teufel los
(Guck, der Seytan beschenkt uns
Er lenkt uns ab und verbrennt uns)
Guck nicht weg, Junge, duck dich jetzt
Denn die Kugeln fliegen low (komm!)
(Komm, spür den Asphalt, ein Knall
Und die Kugel fliegt durch dein Hals)

Früher wollte mein Lehrer, dass ich 'ne Malerlehre mach'
Ich bin am Start, bin am Start, das ist alles, was ich hab', Babe
Und ich merk' wie dir gerade einer abgeht
Keine Sorge Süße, du hast keinen Mundgeruch

Vieles kommt und geht, doch die Erinnerung bleibt bestehen
Den ersten Tokat von mei'm Vater werd ich nie vergessen
Baba, wie oft hast du mich erwischt mit Zigaretten, heh?
Die erste Schlägerei, „Was guckst du, Junge?“
Es war Janina und mein allererster Kuss mit Zunge
Mein Bruder Erdin stiel auf Kombi dieses Gras jacked
Und mein allererster Johnny auf dem Parkdeck
Danke Mama, vallah, denn die Eins bist Du
Ich hab ihn so geliebt, mein' allerersten Nike-Schuh
Das erste Mal, dass ich auf Party war
Mein Onkel starb und mein allerstes ruhuna al fatiha, ah

Ich denke über alte Zeiten nach
Nichts kommt dem ersten Mal so nah
Egal ob es richtig oder falsch war
Du liebst und Du lernst durch das erste Mal
Das erste Mal, das erste Mal
Das erste Mal, erste Mal, erste Mal

Nie werd ich's vergessen, manche Dinge bleiben einfach hängen
Du willst den Scheiß verdrängen, doch so leicht wird es nicht enden
Nicht nur Siege, auch die Niederlagen kommen vor
Wie das erste Mal, als Papa seinen Job verlor
Das erste Mal, als das Cash für die Miete fehlte
Inshallah kommt auch irgendwann die Siegessträhne
Auch wenn sie nichts von meinen kriminellen Jobs wissen
Den ersten Hunni legt ich Mama unter's Kopfkissen
Mercedes E-Klasse war mein erster Mietwagen
Sibel, das erste Mädchen, in das ich mich verliebt habe
Der erste blaue Brief, das erste Mal sitzen bleiben
Und das erste Mal den Bullen meinen Ficker zeigen - Summer

Ob ich es will oder nicht, denn es liegt nicht in meiner Macht
Wie zum Beispiel meine allererste sechs in Chemie
Der erste Beat, den ich hörte, der erste Text, den ich schrieb
Das erste Autogramm, die allerersten Kritiken
Das erste Mal, dass die Juice über Summer Cem berichtete
Der erste Schmuck, drei Düsen für 'ne Kette
Und das allererste Mal auf einer Bühne stehen und rappen
Das erste Mic, das erste Studio mit Eierschal'n
Dann kam mein allererstes Album: Feierabend
Der erste Fan, der schreit „Für dich würd ich sterben, Summer!“
Und der erste Feind, der meint „In Kürze wirst du sterben, Summer.“

Ich denke über alte Zeiten nach
Nichts kommt dem ersten Mal so nah
Egal ob es richtig oder falsch war
Du liebst und Du lernst durch das erste Mal
Das erste Mal, das erste Mal
Das erste Mal, erste Mal, erste Mal

Schritt für Schritt, Du gibst nie auf
Fällst oft hin, doch stehst wieder auf
Schritt für Schritt, Du suchst dein Glück
Es geht nach vorn, es gibt kein zurück

Ich denke über alte Zeiten nach
Nichts kommt dem ersten Mal so nah
Egal ob es richtig oder falsch war

Wurde gestochen und es tat nicht weh.

Ich komm nicht vom Fleck denn deine Liebe ist gottlos.
Sie ist gottlos. Ich verliere die Hoffnung. Denn sie ist gottlos.

Vor etwa einer Stunde hab ich dich das erste Mal gesehen und schon kribbelt es im Bauch, etc. PP. Ich würde dir die Wünsche von den Lippen lesen; nichts könnte ich dir abschlagen. Für dich geh ich lächelnd in den Knast und sitze 8 Jahre. Lass uns weg von hier, lass uns die Segeln hissen. Obwohl ich jetzt schon weiß du wirst mein Leben ficken. Du kannst erzählen was du willst; ich glaube dir jede Scheiße und ich habe Angst davor, dass ich noch auf dich kleben bleiben. Ich bin wie ein Räuber ohne Maske, wie ein Killer ohne Waffe. Ich sollte die Finger von dir lassen. Ich will bleiben - ich will gehen - lass mich doch los! Verliere meinen Glauben denn deine Liebe ist gottlos !

Ich war der Mann am Block, doch vor dir habe ich Angst, 
Denn du hast keine Angst vor Gott.

Ich hab mich geprügelt und alles ausgeknockt
Wie viele Typen hauten mir auf den Kopf. 
Wurde gestochen und es tat nicht weh. 
Ich will gerade stehen doch doch doch

Bei dir wurde ich schwach und vor dir laufe ich weg. 
Denn vor dir habe ich Angst. 
Ich komm nicht vom Fleck denn deine Liebe ist gottlos.
Sie ist gottlos. Ich verliere die Hoffnung. Denn sie ist gottlos.",Gottlos,2013

Rache ist süß, komm mit mir, komm, wir tun ihm weh
Ich weiß genau, er hat dich gekränkt, er war so gemein
Doch jetzt bin ich bei dir, komm mit mir und wir zahlen's ihm heim
Dein Ex ist ein Hurensohn
Ein richtiger Hurensohn
Was ist dein Ex für ein Hurensohn
Ich klatsch ihn weg, diesen Hurensohn

Viele machen Faxen, doch grinsen in den Pump-Lauf. 
Bei dir bricht die Angst aus, 
wie bei einem Bankraub, denn wenn ich bei euch lang lauf', hälst du deine Fresse. Hurensohn ich komme mit Faysal, Ilyas, Ferdi, Ayhan.

Seht her, denn immer wenn mir ein Pisser über den Weg fährt, sich aufspielt, schau-spielt und tut als ob er Paket wär, kriegt er einen Tokat und geht danach schwimmen als wäre er eine Seepferd.

Doch hör mein Album und auf einmal wird gewarnt ums Herz.
Die ander'n machen nur Show, man. Bluffen, sowie beim Pokern.
Doch ich kann euch nicht fühlen, als hätt' ich ein zweites Kondom an.
Scheiss' auf die Wichsers, du gibst Gas und die Lichter, sie strahlen hell
Und wenn du auf die Nase fällst, dann musst du wieder aufstehen.
Viele wollen dich oftmals unten halten und jammern sehen.
Und es ist Winter in deinem Herz, wenn der Summer fehlt.
Die langersehnte Wärme, noch bis du am Zittern.
Und die ander'n seh'n es gerne, doch ich bin auf dem Weg zu dir.

Wenn der Baum seine Blätter verliert,
Ist es Herbst und ein Schmetterling friert.
Und du rufst sein Namen laut,
Denn dein Leben ist sein Tagen grau.
Du willst in einen Winter Schlaf
Und wachst nicht mehr auf.
Doch irgendwann ist Frühling
Und erzeugt sich wieder auf.
Du zählst sehnsuchtig die Tage,
Bald wird alles wieder gut.
So geht es schon seit Jahren;
Hab etwas Geduld, denn erst kommt

Summer Cem,"Sein Name war Tim
Er war noch ein Kind
Hat seine Lieblingsschuhe an, steht im Garten und winkt
Vanessa zu das Mädchen aus dem Nebenhaus
Sie sagt, lass uns ne Runde drehen, ich kenn' mich in der Gegend aus
Denn Tim war gerade hergezogen und weil er keine Freunde hat
War es Vanessa und sein erster Sommer in der neuen Stadt
Selbe Schule, selber Pausenhof, er hat ihr Kakao geholt
Doch sie steht bei den Älteren und raucht sich eine Marlboro
Vanni war gerade vierzehn als sie schon auf der Piste hing
Denn sie war in der Achten als er noch in die Siebte ging
Armer Tim, er war verliebt auch wenn es witzig klingt
Nicht mehr lange bis sie mit dem ersten in die Kiste springt
Denn sie war reifer, weiter, höher und nicht greifbar
Doch man gewöhnt sich dran zu scheitern
Sie wollte feiern, immer wieder feiern und sie schoss sich ab, ab, ab
Hoch zu den Sternen. Auf der Mädchentoilette hat sie das koksen gelernt
Tim fragt was los ist, doch sie log das nichts wär
Er macht sich Sorgen er will sie nicht verlieren. Verstehste?
Er schwänzt mit Vanni die Schule doch ist dann wenigstens bei Ihr verstehste?
Ein 10er Gras von den Jungs die vor der Hauswand dealen, doch dann sagt er
Moment ich will auch mal ziehen
Er war Fußballer, talentiert im Auswahlteam, wenn alles klappt können wir beide bald ins Ausland ziehen

Jahre sind vergangen, Tim legte eine Pause ein
Ich spiele die nächste Saison Mama, nicht traurig sein
Kannst du mir nen 10er leihen? Ich hab da noch was offen
Ich schwörs ich gib's dir wieder Mama Ehrenwort, versprochen
Die Jeans sind zerrissen, Dreck unter den Fingernägeln
Er muss sich mit Vanessa treffen Dinge regeln
Er war so ein guter Junge dieser Tim
Doch sein Verhängnis war das er mit Ungeziefer hing
Siehst du die Sternschnuppen schweifen in der Ferne?
Wind pfeifft ihm ins Gesicht Zeitung schenkt im Wärme
Blech rauchen im miesen Regen alles der Liebe wegen
Und die Karriere im Auswahlteam ist nie gewesen
Wann bricht es ein dieses wackelige Kartenhaus
Vanni schläft auf der Bank während du noch ihre Haare kraulst
Junkielove in jedem Morgen wird sie wachgeküsst
Das Mädchen dass den Namen jungen Tim mit in den Abgrund riss
Und es ist soweit heute ist sein letzter Tag
Hätte er es gewusst hätte er Mama nochmal fest umarmt
Es war Sonntag doch der Tod hat keine Öffnungszeiten
Du siehst sein Feuerzeug unter seinem Löffel kreisen
Er lag am Boden lief rot an und zuckte schon
Vanessa kriegt nix mit sie hat geschossen und fliegt Richtung Mond
Die anderen Jungs von der Marktplatte schreien: Der ist tot
Das war die Story von Tim Mamas einzigen Sohn

Nach dem Gig ins Hotel, stepp durch die Lobby mit 'ner Braut
Drück im Aufzug die Taste, fahr mit ihr rauf in den Achten
Die Kleine fragt mich, wie viel Zigtausend Frauen ich schon hatte
Ich lass sie Spliff rauchen, Dick saugen auf der Terasse
Sie wimmert „Mir ist kalt.“ Theh, ich sage „Kauf dir 'ne Jacke.“
Ey, das ist Bossplayer-Rapshit, Bo-Bo-Bossplayer-Rapshit
Ich smoke die John Player Special, baller durch dein Tom Tailor jacket
Und lass vor Afrikareisen die Slums niederreißen
Denn sie beißen sich stilistisch mit meinen Platinarmreifen

Kleine Frage, ist deine Schwester, die Ebru, da?“

Besser sie gewöhnen sich, der Bösewicht mit königlichem Firmensitz
Mein Schwanz ist auf der Suche nach 'nem Mund, der auf französich spricht

Kurze Pause, im Gedenken an die Rapper von gestern
Mr. Schnabel, Cappuchino, hab den Rest schon vergessen
Große Trauer, denn sie hausen nun in Plattenbauten
Die sie aus tausenden von unverkauften Platten bauten
Ich kenn im Biz nur Lügner
Sie streiten sich um Schnitten wie die Klitschko-Brüder
Ich mach Hits wie am Fließband, werd niemals müde
Mit Vergnügen kack ich Beats aus und piss dann drüber
Häng in den States rum-rum, date Frauen
Du auf Facebook-book - Faceaccounts
Kobain in der Playlist
Fuck, fuck, Jay Z, RAF, RAF Numero Uno, frag, frag KC, ah
Mit 5 km/h fahr' ich unfassbar träge
Und wie Kollegah hat mein schwarzer Wagen Alphagene
Ficke Katzenbergers Popo mit Creme
Auf dem Couchtisch von POCO Domäne, ohne Probleme

Gib der Szene, bis sie kotzt, tief in den Rachen, was will sie machen?

Ah, alles begann mit einem Stift und 'nem dreckigen Beat
Giftige Sätze mit Stil, spit in den Nächten und flieg

Weit von dem Kuchen entfernt, mussten in Studios penn
Und lernten dabei den ein oder anderen Hurensohn kenn
Ich bleibe bis Mitternacht wach, sniper die Pisser vom Dach

Das sind wahre Wunder, jetzt hör mein Album bis zum Ende
Fall auf die Knie, und sprich ein Vaterunser

Alle beten dass ich scheiter
Doch deswegen mach ich weiter
Von wegen es ist einfach
Doch Ich komme immer weiter
Sie beten, dass ich scheiter
Diese Hurensöhne werden immer dreister
Ich seh‘ die Knete und die Weiber
Und ich mache immer weiter

Ich hab weiter gemacht, ich hab weiter gemacht
Ich bin ein Meisterreifer Schreiber voll mit eiserner Kraft
Denn ich ? es hat einfach geklappt
Seh‘ wie du Biter Scheiter tighter für die Heimreise packst
Denn ich bin einfach zu krass, wenn ich die Bars schreib fürs Internet
Wissen meine Fans wieviel Arbeit dahinter steckt
Ich gab ihm damals schon viele Tracks im GD Forum
Garkein verdientes Cash, schlief in einer miesen Wohnung
Wollte angeln es war keiner am Moor
Ey außer Kena Amoa, die Zeit war nicht grad lustig so wie Omar Epps
Doch heute zeig ich meiner Oma Apps
Wer will mit Borak Stress, Mich dissen lange keine Kinder mehr
Denn das wird schmerzhaft wie durch den Schwanz ein Kind gebären
Antigaranti, deine Ohren werd ich dir mit der Hand lieber langziehen, du ganz fieser Junkie

Alle beten dass ich scheiter
Doch deswegen mach ich weiter
Von wegen es ist einfach
Doch Ich komme immer weiter
Sie beten, dass ich scheiter
Diese Hurensöhne werden immer dreister
Ich seh‘ die Knete und die Weiber
Und ich mache immer weiter",Weiter,2013
Summer Cem,"Ah, SC

An alle Rapper, die noch immer auf die Eins warten
Ich lass' einen ziehen und ihr dürft einatmen
Jedes Wort, jeder Satz lässt mich einschlafen
Alles was ihr heute macht, macht' ich schon vor drei Jahren
Schau nach oben und du siehst uns von den Dächern winken
Sucuk und Champagner, der Kanak trägt die Cap nach hinten
Und nicht, dass du's vergisst mein Dawg
Du kannst die Vorhaut zurückziehen aber nicht dein Wort
Sollt' ich am Boden sein oder on top der Hitlist
Rheyd-West ich leb immer noch am Block, ihr wisst es
Alte Freunde dachten, ich werd' wie die Promibitches
Doch wen rufen sie an, wenn der Kopf gefickt ist
Offensichtlich hast du vergessen wer der Typ war
Sie mögen dich nicht, trotzdem lächeln diese Lügner
Damals holt' ich halbe Hähnchen ab aus Eindhoven
Deutsche Rapper sind am Fliegen, doch ich bleib Boden
Und weil ich das gewisse Feeling hab in meinen Strophen
Trifft man dich bei Lidl und mich bei Ralph-Lauren
Ha, Team Summer für die Ewigkeit Brudi, ah

Klar, dass diese Welt mich zum Lachen bringt
Ich hab Geld und die Kasse stimmt
Ich lass mich nicht mehr aus der Fassung bringen
Jeder weiß, dass ich Thema bin
Ich bin vielleicht noch nicht der größte doch ich mach mich auf den Weg dahin
Ich schreib ein Buch es hält dich Wach, wenn du müde bist
Ich hole mir mein HAK, ist die Überschrift
Ich bin in freier Wildbahn
Und gib mich nur mit Leuten, die den selben Film fahren
Du musst Filtern
Ein bisschen Trinken, ein bisschen am Joint puffen
Ich lege keinen Wert auf Instagram-Freundschaften
SC, der Kanacke, den hier jeder liebt
Damals war ich auf der Jagd, nach dem Mega-Deal
Doch heute sind sie alle neidisch auf den Lebensstil
Scheiß drauf, meine Tante Songül hat den Krebs besiegt
Während ihr euch abends am zudröhnen seid
Hör ich wie sie meinen Namen auf Schulhöfen schreien

Wär' meine Family nicht hier, würd ich zehn mal auf die Stadt scheißen
Auf euer rumgeschleime reagier ich abweisend
Denn wenn wir kommen, kassieren Hater viele Backpfeifen
Doch egal, ich darf vom Thema hier nicht abweichen
Summer Cem, ich grüße euch, bei dem Typen läuft
Bevor mir die Worte fehlen, wird's in der Wüste feucht
Du rutschst aus und deine Zukunft ist gefickt
Denn auf der Treppe zum Erfolg sind die Stufen frisch gewischt
Umgeben von Escheks, die reden durchs Headset
Für ein bisschen Fame hast du dein leben gehashtagt
Und auf der Suche, nach 'ner Fehlerlosen Frau
Ist alles was du findest, eine ehrenlose Sau

Sag wie kannst du diesem Mädel bloß vertrauen
Denn nach zwei Gläsern, zieht sie sich die Lederhosen aus
Ich weiß, du bist mit dem Thema schon vertraut
Damals habt ihr über mich und E-K-O gestaunt
Alles beim alten, ich hab das Label nicht getauscht
Banger Musik, ich leb den deutschen Traum
Und diesen Song widme ich meinen Fans
Meinen Brüdern, meinen Schwestern, meinem Team, meiner Gang

Wir laufen zusammen
Hunderttausende Mal
Sprühes auf jede Wand

Wir laufen zusammen
Hunderttausende Mal
Sprühes auf jede Wand

Summer Cem,"I found it an impossible task
To figure out
Which of friend's smile is the best
Dignity

100 Bars, die Reise zum Mars
Ich weiß, ihr wart alle von Zweifeln geplagt
Hält dieser Summer auch ein, was er sagt
Oder hat dieser Rheydter uns einfach verarscht
(Ha, ha!) scheiße, das war's
Ihr hört diesen Song hier auf eigene Gefahr
Ich nehme den Stift, unterschreib' den Vertrag
Banger Musik, der Hype-Apparat

In der Booth und ich flow, uff, es geht los
Vergangenheit, Gegenwart, Zukunft und so
Ich steig' in die Limo und smile in die Cam
Der Kanacke, den ihr von Weitem erkennt
Ich sag nicht, ich tu's (tu's)
Denn „Ich fick deine Mutter“ ist bei mir kein Marketing-Move
Summer, der Hammer, der Killer, der Chief
Hör erst auf zu rappen, wenn Silla nicht schielt

Am Strand eine Villa, ich chille am Beach
Okay, du machst Cash, ich mach zehnmal so viel
Ich bin 2,3 Millimeter vor'm Ziel
Und passe perfekt in das Täter-Profil
Schnapp' mir die Gun, ab in die Bank
Nie wieder Peace oder Waffenstillstand
Wen willst du dissen und ficken in Songs
Jesus Maria im Himmel, ich komm'
(Bomb) Und selbst unter Eid würd' ich schwören
Ich schreib jeden Verse geistesgestört
Glaub nicht alles, was man aus den Zeitungen hört
Die Maskulin-Crew, ich feier die Girls

Als kleines Kind hattest du modischen Style
Dein Vater schickte dich zu Toni & Guy
Mein Vater schickte mich zu „Kodi“ in Rheydt
Denn er leidet an chronischem Geiz
Bei dir gab's Kobe und Reis
Fasülye, bei mir gab's Bohnen mit Fleisch
Wurde groß mit ein paar Sozis im Heim (ah)
Ta Qifsha nonen, du weißt

Damals hat Para für Miete gefehlt
Doch heute muss Mama sich nie wieder quälen
Papa spielt Karten im Lieblingscafe
Ich muss nie wieder Drinks aus der Minibar stehlen
Das Çoban-Prinzip, Bon appetit
Sag wer von euch will jetzt den totalen Beef
Du denkst du bist safe mit der Weste am Block
Sie schützt deine Brust, aber nicht deinen Kopf
Farid, gib mir die Glock, ich visiere und schieß'
Denn deutscher Rap hat keinen Frieden verdient
Bar-Geld, mein Themenbereich
Du hast ein Problem, das regeln wir gleich
Ich zähle bis drei und dein Leben zu ficken
Ist für mich nicht mehr als 'ne Trainingseinheit
Du stempelst die Karten von Zugfahrten ab
Doch sie riegeln für mich grad den Flughafen ab
Klar können wir reden du son of a bitch
Doch erst, wenn du in meiner Gehaltsklasse bist
Ich schreib' so perfekt, jede Line ist ein Brett
Jeder fragt mich nach meinem geheimen Rezept
Nein, du hast kein Zeichen gesetzt
Du hast dich nur auf meinen Steifen gesetzt
Wo ist mein Hak, ich hol es mir jetzt
Als hätt' ich das Land in Narkose versetzt
Keiner, der dope ist wie Summer Cem
Roly am Handgelenk, hol mir die anderen, ah
Ich werd' sie am Mikro misshandel-en
Arriba muchachos ándale ándale, ah

Summer, die anderen Rapper sind fail
Ein rappender Rüpel mit schlechtem Benehmen
Stempel im Pass, ich wechsel die Gates
Muhammed Ali Cem Cassius Clay
Uns geht es offenbar noch 'n Jahr gut
Rapp und sorg aus, toller Beruf
Kommst du nach Haus, sind die Rollladen zu
Weil ich zwei mal am Tag deine Tochter besuch'
Rapper-Karrieren zum Ende zu führen
Glaub mir, ich habe ein Händchen dafür
Der Summer, der euch auch im Winter gefällt
Ich bin nur ich selbst im Chinchilla-Pelz
Hab 'ne Villa gebaut, ein Schiff ist mein Traum
Ich geh' dabei nur von dem Minimum aus
Vorbei ist die Zeit, wo ich Pillen verkauf'
Mein Kontostand löscht die Erinnerung aus

Du bist nicht Drake, nur die deutsche Kopie
Deshalb sind auch die Verkäufe so mies
(Mies!) bei dir läuft, bei mir fliegt
Summer Cem CO2 Neurologie
Während du Pisser ein Nickerchen hältst
Geh' ich nach der Show mit deiner Sis ins Hotel
Ich wollt' mich nur zu ihrem Kitzler gesell'n
Doch es riecht, als hätt' jemand 'nen Fishmac bestellt
Rapper, die sich so wie Hunde benehmen
Sag, wer will uns stoppen auf unserem Weg
Steig in den Mercedes, um Runden zu drehen
Und ficke das Flensburger Punktesystem

Nach diesem Track sind die elenden Pisser
Atemlos so wie Helene Fischer
Und ich bring' frischen Wind in die Stadt
Wie Lotion am Pimmel Vanillegeschmack
Dein Girl hat sich vor Schreck in die Binde gekackt
Als hätt' ich den Code von Da Vinci geknackt
Sie schlafen am Boden, ich stapel Millionen
Und wusste genau, ich wurd' dafür geboren

Geboren als Penner, doch sterben als King

Ständig lächeln Rapper einen an
Doch die Texte die ich rappe kommen nicht vom Herzen
Sondern direkt aus meinem Schwanz – KILLA!
Der Kanacke der vor deine Füße kackt
Es ist SC die 1 ich hab Hype in jeder Stadt
Clubshows, dicke Gage ich mach Scheine über Nacht
Lederjacke so schwer, bis der Kleiderbügel knackt!
Ich komm zwar rüber wie ´ne geldgeile Sau
Doch meine Alben lösen bei den anderen Selbstzweifel aus, Brudi!
Bitches sind mir über iPhone am texten
Während ich im Flieger sitze und die Zeitzone wechsle
Du willst einmal wie ein Star ins rechte Licht drücken?
Doch ich will einfach meinen Arsch in dein Gesicht drücken!

Nur weil ich die Frau des ein oder anderen MC‘ hämmer!

Denk ich mir ich Kanone
Alle schreiben auf den Beat aber ich kann ohne!
Ich komm mit acht Ochsen rum
Und du schreist Abow jedes Mal wenn meine Stimme durch die Bassboxen brummt!
Handtuch du kennst mich, von Frankfurt nach Venice
Alles was ich mach‘ Brudi ist ganz großes Tennis
Jetzt macht da draußen jeder Schwanz Welle
Doch das kann ich nicht zulassen wie 'ne Autobahntankstelle
Bedanke dich wenn dieser Cem deine Schlampe fickt
Keiner kennt dich doch dann stehst du Penner mal im Rampenlicht!
Nichts hat sich geändert von Grund auf asozial
Deine Mom will blasen? Mund auf – Sagrotan!
Du findest Leichen im Kanal
Vielleicht fick ich anal vielleicht aber auch nicht
Ah, du schreist Abow wenn du mich siehst
Hurensöhne wollen reden, geht und holt euch ´nen Termin! Ha!

Summer Cem,"OK, los geht's
Du machst vor den Fans auf Prophet
Doch vor ein paar Jahren da kannte dich keiner
Denn da warst du Hänger noch No Name
Doch wenn Eko und Cem dir die Show stehlen
Heißt es für dich wieder Straßen Cypher
Bin ich am Rappen sind die Fans am Becken wie Bademeister
Naber kleiner
Ich bin wieder am Mic mit Freezy
Du siehst uns vielleicht im TV
Bevor ich dich feature beiß' ich in eine Bifi
Never ever
Ich komme mit Bora so wie Black & Decker
Cemo can der beste Mann
Ollum ihr seid schlechte Rapper
Wenn ich ficken will ist deine Bitch parat
Wenn ich von Eisberg rede mein ich nicht Salat
Aufgewachsen in Mitten von Ratten
Doch wenn ich mir heute nen 6er hole
Mein ich nicht die Chicken Mc Nuggets
Keine Zeit für die Testfahrt zeig mir die Extras
Frag nur soll ich Bar oder mit Check zahlen, weg da
Wenn du Rapstar bist
Erklär mir warum du in einem Vectra sitzt?
Fakt ist dein Image juckt mich nicht
Doch wenn du mal in meiner Hood bist Bitch
Duckst du dich

Ich bin ein abgefuckter Eselfickender
Basyschwingender, ladykillener

Chef der gesamten Menschheit

Titten sind handsigniert
Du bist kein Mann wie wir
Also ruf an wenn dir Bars fehlen
Platz ich in die Bude rein, hörst du die Groupies schrein
Besser du suchst dir einen Plan B

Es waren mal zwei Rheydter Jungs und 15 Jahre später
Waren sie für deine Lieblingsstraßenkünstler ihre Väter
Von der Decke kommt der Putz runter
Rappe immer putzmunter
Ihr wiegt euch in Sicherheit
Wie Fette in 'nem Schutzbunker
Freezy dieser Penner Mönchengladbach represent
Glaub mir wenn er sprechen könnte
Sagt mein yarak bei mir renn
Eure Mamas sind gebangt
Ich bums heute wieder 'ne Frau tot
Die Schuhe kosten viel wie ein Auto
Heb für die Kunst, die sie lieben, die Faust hoch
Ich bin 31 Jahr, Du bist 31er
Wichse 31 mal und sie hat weißen Schleim im Haar
Fahre einen weißen Q7
Alle die meine Crew lieben
Wissen ich hab keinen Bock zu zählen
Und fange an die Scheine zu wiegen
Eko da, Eko hier
Ghettostar, respektiert
Ladies lassen sich meinen gottverdammten Namen tätowieren
Bismillah, ich bin da
Füll schonmal das Whisky Glas
Sie legen sich vor mich und spreizen die Beine
Und zeigen mir das ich mal fisten darf
Du bist Armani Boss, ich trag die gute Levis
Denn ich bin haya, sogar Bruce Lee weiß
Manche ziehen weiß, aber Ekrem Bora nicht
Rap mich in die Oberschicht, der Backstage in die Cola pisst
Viele sind hängen geblieben auf Cordon Sport und Testo Kur
Man ich hab ne top Figur, ich ficke deine Box Frisur
Eure Majestät, nenn' mich Eule oder Fake
Mache nach all diesen Jahren mit Summer und Farid immer noch Euros wie es geht

Und hab dein jährliches Einkommen am Finger.(Finger)
Du erzählst uns von deiner Vorliebe für Chicks
Doch in Wirklichkeit hast du die Dorfziege gefickt
Ich bin die 1 hier, behalt deine Wortspiele für dich
Ich bleibe King und sitz weiterhin vorm Spiegel und wichs
Zu viele kleine Bitches
Im Publikum deine Nichte
Ah, gib mir 'nen ? Und ich schreib Geschichte

Heute geb ich Gas und sitz Late-Night in nem Porsche

Heute danke ich ihnen für ihre wegweisenden Worte
Auf dem Weg zu dem Mio
Geh und ließ meine Bio 
Ich kann mich nicht entscheiden, LA oder Rio

Langweilige Strophen, von diesen Hipster Rappern
Gestern Rapstar, doch heute Pizzabäcker
Denn dir fehlt zum Mic checken die Luft
Nach zwei Sätzen ist Schluss, deine Reimketten sind Schmutz
Du meinst du legst den Fokus auf eingängige Hooks
Während dessen bläst deine Mutter freihändig und schluckt
Lange Zeit war es am regnen, ich greif mir die Moneten
Mit mir ficken ist wie mit einer Beinprothese breaken
Ich hab's mir geschworen, heut ist mein Keller voller Prada

Wenn du gelenkig bist könn' wir's auch im Porsche machen
Das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte!
Ich hab die Sahne Baby
Du musst nur die Torte backen!
Das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte!
Du kannst es nicht erwarten mir mal in die Shorts zu fassen
Schöne Grüße, das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte!

Ah, wenn du morgen neben mir wach wirst
Das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte
Und du spürst was Hartes an deinem Rücken
Das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte
Und du denkst echt das ist die Universalfernbedienung
von gestern Abend noch (Das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte)
Nein, das bin ich man, ich geh in Rücken rein
Das bin ich und meine Morgenlatte
Ah Summer, ha!",Ich & meine Morgenlatte,2014
Summer Cem,"Ah, SC, Haa!
Ich schreib ein Buch es hält dich wach wenn du müde bist
„ich hole mir mein HAK“ ist die Überschrift
Ich wusste irgendwann fangen sie zu pöbeln an
Doch da wo ich gerade bin kriegst du Höhenangst
Hände nach oben, denn Cem hat's befohlen
Der Weltuntergang wurd auf November verschoben
(Ha) Ich hab ein Mörderalbum eingerappt
(Ha) Plötzlich wird die Körperhaltung steif vor Schreck
Auch wenn dieser Hayvan in den Käfig rein gehört
Sind sie erleichtert wenn sie von mir ein Lebenszeichen hören
Es ist mein Name den die Mädels schreien in Chören
Und ich hab den Tunnelblick wie Lady Di's Chauffeur
Klar dass deine Futt grade bläst
Immer wenn der Wind durch meine Brusthaare weht
Du schaust zu, Summer macht's, Boomshakalak
Weil ich zu schwarze Haare für das „Juice“-Cover hab
Mein Opa kam auf einem Esel doch jetzt rollt Cem im Benz
Und die Goldkette glänzt durch das Holzfäller-Hemd
Guck mal ich bin ausser Reichweite
Und deine Videos auf Youtube haben Alles
Alles ausser Reichweite, Banger Musik
Jetzt kommt der Neue rein
Rapper küssen meine Hand und schwören mir den Treueeid
Huh, mein lieber Herr Gesangsverein
Das Leben ist 'ne Bitch lass dich niemals auf die Schlampe ein
Ah, damit sie kurz den Penis saugt
Ah, brauch ich keinen durchtrainierten Bauch
Familienstatus „du kannst die Kindersitze rauswerfen“
Ich zähle Para bis die Fingerspitzen taub werden
Wer will Beef? Hand hoch du fällst
Manchmal hör ich meine Disstracks und hab Angst vor mir selbst
Ich hab den Besserwisser-Flow und sitz lächelnd auf dem Thron
Fliegen wie ein Schmetterling, Stechen wie 'n Skorpion
Und jetzt steht er da, direkt vor deiner Nase
S-U-Doppel-M Pünktchen Pünktchen Komma Blasen
Deine Mama wollt mit Summer nur ein Wort wechseln
Doch 2 Minuten später knabbert sie am Ohrläppchen
Ha, jeder Part von mir scheppert
Bei dir ist jede Bar für 'n Arsch, wie der Stepper
Du vermisst den Summer erst wenn du im Winter frierst
Klar kannst du dich melden, aber nicht bei mir
Besten Dank auf einmal hat das Leben Sektempfang
Für 'ne saubere Zukunft bin ich durch den Dreck gegangen
Das Leben schenkt mir keine Pause
Und das was für dich Chaos ist, nenn' ich mein Zuhause
Sie fühlen nichts außer Eifersucht
Immer wenn der Beat durch den iPod pumpt
100.000 Platten, du bließt für das Gold
Mein Schwanz in deinem Mund ist der Weg zum Erfolg
Es gibt bei deinen Alben keinen Trommelwirbel
Denn du setzt sie in den Sand, wie Sonnenschirme
Steig aus der Karre zieh die Knarre und erschiess Hunde
Kläre deine Mama und sammle mir Sympathie-Punkte
Ha, nachdem wir eure Schwestern blasen lassen
Machen sie uns eine Szene, wie Fatih Akin
Du hältst die Fresse wenn der König zu der Masse spricht
Und machst große Geschäfte höchstens wenn du Kacken bist
Dieses Intro fühlt sich an wie 31 Türkenschwänze
Und du zeigst keinerlei Berührungsängste
Ich hab die Guett dabei, Skimaske, Gangsterstyle
Und hol mein Hak als wär Deutscher Rap 'ne Metzgerei

Hak",Intro,2014
Summer Cem,"Yao, ah

Ich schreib deiner Schwester bei Facebook „Hi, Flittchen“
Sie fragt „Hast du mich vermisst, Schatz?“ „Kein bisschen!“
Denn mein Tag beginnt mit O-Saft und leichtem Jogging
Instagram-Fotos gucken, Cybermobbing
Ah, ich hab den Ballermann am Start (klick klick)
Er macht Baratatatata (schip schip)
Halt schon mal die Kamera parat (Knips knips)
Ich servier den Yarrak a la carte

Ich hab so viele Probleme, aber Geld ist keins davon
Packe meine Rolex in den Safe, sonst rennt mir die Zeit davon
Mein Name spricht Bände in hellen Farben an Wänden
Und an dem Tag, an dem ich sterbe, liegt im Sarg 'ne Legende
Viele wollen mich stoppen auf meinem Weg
Bekommen dann Faust in ihr Face
Guck, deine Frau, wie sie bläst
Ich zeig ihr den Cock, bitte mach's dir bequem
Und jetzt habt ihr gesehen
Ich kann jeden ficken, aber bitte sagt mir nur wen
Du musst die Lage verstehen
S zu dem Cem, Kawasaki im Game

Ich mach den Tank voll

Drei, zwei Sekunden von null auf hundert
Ich fahr' vorbei, sie schreien „Wir lieben diesen Summer Abi“

Mein Sportauto in der Einfahrt
Fortlaufende Einnahmen
Dich trifft man mit siebzehn Mann beim Vorsaufen mit Ayran
Wenn ich spitz bin, will ich nicht schwimmen
Und zieh die Shorts aus im Freibad
Und such mir eine Mordsbraut
Die mein Rohr kaut, wenn ich einschlaf
Ah, ich hab die Scharfe grade eingesteckt
Wir sind Wölfe, holt die Schafe von der Weide weg
Alle fragen, wo gerade deine Leiche steckt
Meine Brüder tragen Bart nicht aus dem Style-Aspekt

Komm in dein Dorf mit den Bangern
Du kommst dir vor wie ein Penner
Okay, dein Golf ist schnell
Aber der Porsche ist schneller
Ich will deine Frau nur ficken
Ich hab nicht vor, sie zu schwängern
Denn eigentlich bin ich zurückhaltend wie Pornodarsteller
Jeder meiner Feinde wünscht mir den Tod
Geht und wünscht euch 'nen Flow
Ich hab eine Bombe gelegt und die Zündung geht los
Klar, dass meine Feinde schon verzweifeln und am Schießen sind wie Paparazzi

Ich mein'
Du wirst jetzt denken ich bin ein Höhlenmensch oder so
Aber ich sag's dir einfach wie es ist
Ich bin nicht altmodisch, garnicht
Aber

Ich kann dir sagen wie sich Bitch definieren lässt
Dein Macker babysittet, du dagegen hast auf allen Vieren Sex
Die Bahn geschnappt, kommst nach Hause, guten Abend Schatz
Küsst ihn mit dem Mund, mit dem du grade erst geblasen hast
Du lässt dich von acht Dödeln durch die halbe Stadt vögeln
Ausgelatschte Ballerinas, Nagellack am abbröseln
Du hast ein' Faible für Kanacken mit 'nem Boxerschnitt
Und bist die Eins, in der Kategorie Opferfick
Hast keine Pille und nie ein Kondom in deiner Tasche
Denn für dich ist Verhütung nur eine Timing-Sache
Hol ihn einfach raus, komm auf meinem Bauch
Nur du, deine Kollegen und ich auf deiner Couch
Und weil du so vielen Männern auf die Mailbox sprichst
In der Hoffnung, dass dir einer in den Kehlkopf fickt
Kriegst du nie einen Mann, aller höchstens einen Otto
You only live once, ist das Motto, Kopf hoch

Ein One-Night-Stand im Fahrradkeller, das Licht brennt
Und du fragst dich, warum sie dich Bitch nennen
So viele Männer, die die Farbe deines Slips kennen
Und du fragst dich, warum sie dich Bitch nennen
Durex, Billyboy, London und Big Ben
Und du fragst dich, warum sie dich Bitch nennen
Vier Kinder von drei Männern, du fickst fremd
Und du fragst noch, warum sie dich Bitch nennen

Ich glaube nicht, dass ich Bitch definieren muss
Dein Macker ist am Babysitten, während du auf allen Vieren lutschst
Bei dir haben alle Typen Freifahrt
Jeder darf dich ficken aber grüßen tut dich keiner
Denn jeden Abend wird gebangt
Mit Jungs deren Namen du nicht kennst
Ich hab dir ein Tagebuch geschenkt
Bitch, mach dir eine Strichliste oder mach dir lieber eine Fickliste
In deiner Blickdichten Strumpfhose rumposen
Auf Instagram den kompletten Winter lang die ganze Stadt gebummst
Der Schwanz-Geschmack im Mund mit Airwaves gemischt
Denn du gibst jedem, der in einem Mercedes sitzt
Per se 'nen Fick, ah
Und dein Bruder sagt, dass du im falschen Kreis verkehrst
Weil du bei Gangbang-Runden im Kreis verkehrst
So kriegst du nie 'nen Mann, aller höchstens einen Otto
You only live once, ist das Motto, Kopf hoch

Ein One-Night-Stand im Fahrradkeller, das Licht brennt
Und du fragst dich, warum sie dich Bitch nennen
So viele Männer, die die Farbe deines Slips kennen
Und du fragst dich, warum sie dich Bitch nennen
Durex, Billyboy, London und Big Ben
Und du fragst dich, warum sie dich Bitch nennen
Vier Kinder von drei Männern, du fickst fremd
Und du fragst noch, warum sie dich Bitch nennen

Das Wort Bitch hab ich schon oft gebraucht
Wenn der Macker Babysittet während du an einem Knochen kaust
Wie ein räudiger Hund, kleine Frage, heut schon gebummst
Ich bin grade mit 'nem Freund und komm' rum
Ich lad dich ein, nicht dass ich geizig oder großkotzig wär
Doch ein ganzes Hüftsteak ist mir der Blowjob nicht wert
So kriegst du nie einen Mann, aller höchstens einen Otto
You only live once, ist das Motto, Kopf hoch

Ach, wenn ihr Kerle alle Frauen fickt, ist das in Ordnung
Aber wenn ich auf jeden Schwanz springe, bin ich 'ne Schlampe
Ich bin keine Bitch, ich bin 'ne Playerin, Wichser",Kopf hoch Bitch,2014
Summer Cem,"Und deine Bitch weiß, ich fick gleich
Und hab in meinem Dick Power
Neben Burj Khalifa sieht er aus wie sein Twin Tower
Und wieso ich mit den Bastarden Beef hab?
Weil sie mehr auf Gangster machen als ein Knasttätowierer
Farid Bang, sprich mich mit „Eure Hoheit“ an
Denn ich bin der Typ, der nach dem Sex aus Gewohnheit zahlt
Ich koks zwei Gramm und werde Bitches klatschen
Wenn sie während der Fernsehwerbung dazwischen quatschen
Rapper gehen zum Major, denn sie sind unbekannt
Werden fame, doch riechen aus dem Mund nach Schwanz
Das ist dein Untergang, heute kriegst du in die Fresse
Und du hältst den Rand wie ein Nichtschwimmer im Becken
Stichsichere Weste hab ich in meinem Kofferraum
Und Siggi, wieso sieht dein Dick wie eine Pommes aus
Ich fick deine Fotzen-Frau, gib ihr im Mercedes Schwanz
Farid Bang, Tag-Team, ein Leben lang

Was ihr braucht, damit ich etwas gegen eure Mütter sage?
Ein bisschen Flow und einen Künstlernamen, ah
Nur weil auf meinem Brötchen Helal-Schinken war
(Ah) Stellen sie mich als Salafisten dar

Es ist wieder so weit, das ist Mafia-Musik
Helal-money-gang, welcher Bastard will Beef?
Ich bin immer noch nicht müde, selbst nach acht Jahren Krieg

Zieh den Kopf ein, wenn der Kanakk aus dem Lastwagen schießt

Sie nennen mich Doktor Sommer auch wenn mir der Doktortitel fehlt
Banger-Musik, deutscher Rap ist für mich offenes Buffet
Rapper tun, als ob sie Knete haben und die Gewehre laden
Und schwören auf Koran, bevor sie ihn gelesen haben
Ah, ich lauf mit Vollbart durch Amerika
Deine dicke Kette ist nicht aus Gold, sondern aus Edelstahl
Auch wenn mir mein Feind vor Gericht über den Weg läuft (Weg läuft)
Werd' ich dichthalten wie Haze-Joints
Und mein Name bringt Bordell-Fotzen zum Blasen
Rapper fahren nur 'nen Kombi um Hotelkosten zu sparen
Mein Schwanz macht den Teenie-Mösen sorgen
Denn er entspricht in etwa der Zucchini-Größenordnung
Klar, dass sich die Kohle gerade häuft
Oğlum, bei mir läuft

Lade nochmal nach und gebe meiner Uzi Futter

Selbst der BND, Mossad und Scotland Yard
Kommen anscheinend nicht auf mein Hugo Boss-Hemd klar
Beim Pokern fragen sie mich, wie kann man so viel Knete setzen?
Tja, mein Vater er will jeden Tag Garnelen essen
Über die Grenze schmuggeln meine Jungs Tonnen
Drogendeals sind wie Caipi, den dabei muss was rumkommen
Fick die Armut, lang hab ich es versucht
Doch diesen Weg geh ich ganz bestimmt nicht barfuß
Sollt ich mir bei Zalando Schuhe holen
Gib ich die Rechnung deinem Vater zahl an du Hurensohn
Klatsch meinen Schwanz in die Fresse deiner Freundin
Neureich, Handinnenflächen wie ein Säugling
Noch nie gejobbt doch er fährt mit dem Volltank ins Magic Casino

Pscht, Mocassins, helle Jeans
Kurdo, Summer Cem, echte Männer-Stil
Banger Beats, schnelle Deals
Die dich aus der Menge ziehen, wenn du Bastard Welle schiebst
Ich nehm euch Schwuchteln sowieso nicht ernst in enge Jeans
Mach mir nicht auf krassen Hardrocker, du Zahnstocher
Mein Ziel war es schon damals alles selbst machen
Label gründen, in Benz ficken, Geld waschen
Ich muss lachen wenn Frauen einen auf eng machen
Mit Chanel-Taschen, gefälschte Pelzjacken
Rapper rappen seit Jahren, dass es ihnen schlecht geht
Kommen auf's Konzert und wollen belesh in mein Backstage
Oman Gees auf Tilidin, aus Gaziantep
In schwarzen Lackschuhen, weißes Hemd, Klassik-Mantel
Schwarzgeld zurück schicken an die Verwandten
Mit Kopfnicken, sich beim Bandit bedanken

Summer Cem,"Ha, ein paar Hunde wollen dissen
Und nennen es danach noch gesunde Competition
Beef mit mir, da gibt's nix zu quatschen
Das ist wie 'n Swingerclub, du fickst mit dem falschen
Meine Jungs sind aus der Kanalisation
Klar können wir reden, aber nicht in diesem Ton
Keiner, der die Rapper fickt
Meine Brüder haben Messer mit
Und sitzen lebenslänglich wie Professor X
Zehnmal Summer in dem zehnfach-CD-Wechsler
Diese Szene wird rasiert, Mähdrescher
Sitze vor dem Lenkrad winkend aus dem Benz fahren
Wicked, ich bin Gangster, Rhythm is a Dancer
Und weil ich jeden Tag zu Gott bete
Soll ich im Höllenfeuer brennen, wenn ich einem Rapper Props gebe
Okay, du bist auf dem Pfadfindertrip
Doch vergiss nicht, ich hab dein Arschloch gefickt
Jedes Wort, was sie sagt, brennt
Wie Benzin in meiner Lunge meine Hintergedanken liegen auf der Zunge
Ich weiß, du machst dir Kopf, Brudi, dich bringen die Sorgen um
Doch uns're Mucke ist dein Heilmittel, Morphium

Keine Musterknaben, wir sind nicht die Sorte Jungs
Wir entsprechen leider nicht euren Forderungen
Bis in die Morgenstunden fahren wir im Porsche rum
Gefühlslos und kalt, Morphium
Morphium, ich hab das Gefühl, sie orten uns
Wir inhalieren das Gift und wir torkeln rum
Bis in die Morgenstunden, schrauben an Akkorden rum
Uns're Mucke, sie ist Gift, Morphium

Dieser Cem ist nice, ich häng' in Rheydt
Hier siehst du Deutsche konvertieren wie MP3s
Hol deine Freunde, doch ich regel meine Dinge selbst
Denn ich hab die Cojones, Jinglebells
Keinen Ausweg, es gibt keinen Plan B
Meine Faust trägt den Spitznamen Zahnfee
Und sag mir bitte einen hier, der Cem bedroht
Und ich lass ihn heute direkt bluten in Magenta-Rot
Auf die linke Tour mit Summer, dieses Geld ist nichts
Ich ess' den Oktopus, als hätt' ich ihn selbst gefischt
Tic-tac, ich komm in 'nem X6
Die Bullen, sie wollen einen Pisstest
Doch können mir gerne mal einen blasen mit Blistex
Gott weiß, ich komm aus dem Blocklife ins Spotlight
Okay, du schlägst ein Buch auf, aber ich dir dein Jochbein
Augen zu, denn diesen Weg hab ich nicht ausgesucht
Früher hab ich uns're Siedlung und das Haus verflucht
Meine Jungs haben den Tod in der Fresse
Und deine Jungs haben nur Kot in der Fresse

Zwei Schüsse ohne Plan und verwirrt

Nicht, weil's mich zu 'nem besseren Menschen macht
Sondern weil es mich vergessen lässt
Ich war frech zu Baba und hört leider oft nicht
Doch diesmal soll es ein Gucci-Gürtel sein, der meinen Kopf trifft
Merke, wie sie auf das Doppel-G auf meinem Polo blicken
Nie wieder Bus und Bahn fahren mit einem SchokoTicket
Ich hab' leider noch nie eine Musikschule besucht
Aber gib mir 'nen Beat und ich bring Dynamit mit in die Booth
300-Gramm-Goldkette wie ein Sultan uff
Symbolisch für die Last, die ich auf meinen Schultern trug
Ich hab die „Ich geb' keinen Fick“-Attitüde mir nicht ausgesucht
Doch heute fächert mir das Leben gute Laune zu

Und jeder Millimeter, den ich gehen kann in den Nike Airs
War den Scheiß wert, denn irgendwann schmilzt der Eisberg
Und das ist meine momentane Sicht
Ich bin am Scheinen und muss nicht mehr darauf warten
Bis ein Sonnenstrahl mich trifft

Ich hör nur auf mein Herz, komme von weit her
Gib nicht auf, wisch den Staub von den Nike Airs
Meine Beine schwer, als ob sie aus Blei wären
Komm, steh auf, wisch den Staub von den Nike Airs
Auch wenn die Welt für mich mittlerweile hell aussieht
Werd' ich nie die Zeit vergessen, als das Geld ausblieb
Raus aus der Kanalisation, rein in die Penthouse-Suite
Denn wer hoch fliegt, fliegt, der fällt auch tief

Ich hab' so viele Bündel Geld, die aus meiner Tasche rauspack
Für jedes Mal, als sie auf uns von oben herabgeschaut hat
Und meine Kindheit, sie war ätzend, Brudi
Da wo ich herkomm', kriegst du nichts, nur Komplexe Brudi
Etwas Flex und Shuvi
heut' bau ich ein Haus für sie, denn uns geht es dufte
Für jeden Cent, den meine Mama umdrehen musste
Alle machen große Augen, scheiße, so wird's laufen
Kannst du die Sterne sehen, wenn nicht, guck auf meine Motorhaube
Damals musst' ich Radios aus den Wagen klauen
Weil mir das Geld gefehlt hat für den Macchiato-Schaum
Doch heute steigt der Flieger erst, wenn ich an Bord bin
Das sind die Karten, die das Leben mir verteilt hat, ich bin All-In

Und jeder Millimeter, den ich gehen kann in den Nike Airs
War den Scheiß wert, denn irgendwann schmilzt der Eisberg
Und ich geb auf dein Kommentar 'nen Fick
Ich bin am Scheinen und muss nicht mehr darauf warten

Ich erkämpfe mir den Weg, egal wo du bist
Ich hab dich so vermisst, ich hol mir dich

Wie viele Männer sind für dich schon in den Bau gegangen?

Doch ich wollte mehr von dir als ein paar Tausender
Immer wenn ich fiel, hast du mich aufgefangen
Doch irgendwie ist zwischen uns das Feuer ausgegangen

Du warst mein bester Freund, doch bist jetzt mein Feind
Mein Kissen riecht nach dir, wir haben ein Bett geteilt
Erinner mich an jedes dieser Details
Deine braune Haut, grüne Augen, lilanes Kleid
Und so schön wie du bist, glaub mir zöger ich nicht
Wenn es sein muss, töt ich für dich
Weil du meine Königin bist

Nacht für Nacht hab ich Jagd auf dich gemacht
Sag wie oft noch scheitern wie vergebens an dem Hindernis?
Doch jeder Hunni ist mir ein Teelicht in der Finsternis
Ich hab von dir geträumt, in meinem Kinderzimmer
Du und ich für immer immer, für immer immer?
Ich liebe dich, du musst es endlich akzeptieren
Am liebsten würd ich mit dir die Wände tapezieren
Komm zu mir mein Schatz, du musst keine Angst haben
Ich lass dich in mein Bett, du musst nicht auf der Bank schlafen
Nur dir mein Baby, widme ich diese Liebesstrophen
Ich hab dich aufgerollt, und durch dich Kokain gezogen
Gern können sie mich mit Blei durchsieben
Wenn ich dich nicht haben kann, soll dich keiner kriegen (Bang,Bang)

Ich hab dich schon geliebt mit 16
Jetzt wollen sie dich mir wegnehmen (Bang,Bang)
Doch ich lass diesen Scheiß nicht zu
Ich putz die Knarre mit nem Seidentuch (Bang,Bang)
Siehst du Kugeln durch die Scheiben fliegen?
Wenn nicht ich, soll dich keiner kriegen (Bang,Bang)

Die anderen Spinner sind keine Gefahr

Sie schaufeln sich grade ihr eigenes Grab

Wenn jeder Rapper mir nur ehrenlos am Schwanz hängt

Sind der Grund, warum wir immer unsere Nummern wechseln

Deine Mutter fick, als wären wir Leistungssportler

Summer der Killer, es sei dir gesagt
Die anderen Spinner sind keine Gefahr
Die Rapper die dissen, sollten besser wissen
Sie schaufeln sich grade ihr eigenes Grab

Wer kann mir sagen, wo ein Regenbogen anfängt
Wenn jeder Rapper mir nur ehrenlos am Schwanz hängt
Rapper die so tun, als ob sie grad mit ihrem Kumpel sprechen
Sind der Grund, warum wir immer unsere Nummern wechseln
(Ayo ayo) Spiel den King hier weit und breit, du kennst meinen Vibe

Wer brachte euch den großen Gangster Sound?
Ich geh 'ne Runde kacken um mein Monument zu bauen
Vielleicht hält's du diesen Summer für 'nen miesen Wichser
Ich komm vorbei, 8 Kanacken in nem 7-Sitzer
Sc, Der Schwarzkopf, den die Medien hypen
Ich kam vom Eselreiten zu Segelreisen
Ich mach die Flocken während du in deiner Bude chillst
Stell dich hinten an, wenn du ein Stück vom Kuchen willst
Viele Bitches sehen den Schmuck an diesem Mann
Und denken sich dann, den rupf ich wie 'ne Gans
Die sorte Frau die man liebhaben muss
Die nie in deine Augen sondern auf Kreditkarten guckt, sie
Wünschen sie Männer die sie tragen auf Händen
Und tun so als ob sie unsre Rappernamen nicht kennen (Summer Cem? Ah hh)
Sagt mir nix, echt nicht
In Wahrheit hat sie jeden meiner Parts in Gedächtnis
Und sie sagt, privat hört sie Nickleback
Nur damit ich denke, das sie sich nicht ficken lässt
Was du meinst Nutte, schön am Wein nuckeln
Angeblich lässt du dich von Geld nicht beeindrucken
Geld ist dir egal, du guckst nur auf Charakter
Warum steigst du Nutte dann nicht in 'nen Mazda?
Warum muss ich dich in nen Jeep abholen?
Tu nicht so, ich weiß du stehst auf dieses Pi Pa Po
Erst sagen sie, sie wären von den stilvollen
Doch sind die ersten, die dann in den VIP wollen
Egal was du denkst, Summer macht es richtig
Es ist immer noch, Para over Bitches

Aha, jetzt beginnt die Talfahrt
Ihr wollt Loyalität obwohl ihr nie loyal wart
Doch diese Kugeln töten
Ich hab lieber eine Hand voll Brüder
Als ein Rudel voller Hurensöhne
Glaub mir Homie dieser Sound hat seine Richtigkeit
Denn du brauchst keine Fotze um ne Bitch zu sein
Denn du bist auch ne Bitch wenn du für bisschen Geld
Deinen Bruder in den Rücken fällst
Sie wollen wissen was du in der Geldbörse hast
Das ding das sogar taube Menschen, hellhörig macht
Doch keiner von ihnen will was wissen von deinen Battle-Songs
Bis du mit deinem dicken Schlitten um die Ecke kommst
Alle sagen, Salam Brudi, was geht Chef
Und auf einmal ist jeder zweite dein Bf
Hör mal wenn du Flaschen öffnest, siehst du die Rattenköpfe
Blutsauger, die von deinem Geld naschen möchten
Geier, die sich als deine Cousins ausgeben
Wollen neben dir nicht mal einen Cent ausgeben
Am liebsten würden sie mit dir in deinem Penthouse leben
Und es ist dein Geld mit dem sie aus dem Benz rauswedeln
Heut sagt jeder, du bist der Chief auf den Songs
Damals C&A, heut Eve Soloro
Ich erkenn die kleinen Lügner
Du kannst vielleicht dein Polohemd wechseln
Aber niemals deine Brüder
Auf den weg zum Reichtum und dicken Jeeps
Para over Bitches, meine Philosophie
Denn egal was du tust, vergiss bitte nie

Fick ich Eva Mendes als wär mein Name Ryan Gosling
Du lebst dein Leben zwischen Schäferhund und Traktor
Bei deiner Frau darf jeder rein, Wlan ohne Passwort, Homes
Weil die Meisten mich zur Siegersorte zählen
Bin ich ein Drahtzieher, wie Kieferorthopäden

Und dann hat dieses Ganze ein Ende
Hoffentlich gibt's nur Freudestränen

Sahst du Licht, egal wie dicht die Bäume stehen?
Würde es bedeuten, du hast nichts bereut im Leben
Die Zeit kommt und du musst einsehen
Nur Glück, Family und die Gesundheit zählen

Materielles ist vergänglich
Gut, dass in dein Leben ein paar der Heuchler kamen
Somit weißt du, wer die wahren Freunde waren, ah
Was hast du viel gelacht
Was wohl deine erste Liebe macht?
Warst dir sicher, dass sie einfach perfekt ist
Was ist, wenn du sie geheiratet hättest?
Du denkst dir „Bitte lass mich verschont“

Auch, wenn er nicht auf der Gästeliste steht
Schau auf deine Uhr, deine Zeit tickt, tickt
Dem Tod ist egal, ob du 30 bist
Vierzig, fünfzig, Oder nur acht

Ich nehm's in Kauf sollt ich nachts auf meiner Route frieren
Bestellt den Helikopter ab, ich komm zu Fuß zu dir
Du bist für mich da auch wenn ich mal schlecht gelaunt bin
Wenn du das Nikotin bist, dann will ich in Ketten rauchen
Ich bleib wach wenn du müde bist und pennst
Wenn das hier unser Tempel ist bist du das Fundament
Ich will dich lachen sehen und gib dir keinen Grund zum Weinen
Wenn du das Salz bist dann lass mich die Wunde sein
Ich will dich wie du bist mit allem was dazugehört
Als ich vom Weg abkam warst du mein Google Earth
Ich wollte Twittern doch ich wusste es wird nicht reichen
Denn meine Liebe passt leider nicht in hundertvierzig Zeichen
Ohne dich bin ich nicht komplett
Was würd'' ich machen wenn ich dich nicht hätt'?

Ich bleib bei dir solang du mich lässt
Du bist meine Sucht, mein Crystal Meth
Ich lass nicht zu, dass man dich verletzt
Ohne dich bin ich nicht komplett
Was würd' ich tun wenn ich dich nicht hätt'?

Ich war mein halbes Leben lang schon auf dem falschen Weg
Als mir die Worte fehlten warst du mein Alphabet
Halt dir die Ohren zu mein Schatz denn sie reden wieder
Du bist das Original die Anderen sind nur Made in China
Du kannst mir glauben für dich sitz' ich gern im Todestrakt
Wenn ich Da Vinci bin, dann hast du meinen Code geknackt
Ich hab gesehen dass du die Chance nie bekommen hast
Wenn deine Liebe blind macht bin ich gerne Stevie Wonder
Denn mit dir bin ich komplett, du bist der allerletzte Baustein
Wenn du ein Stern bist, dann will ich Astronaut sein
Du musst nur ja sagen, denk dran
Ich will nicht dich nur deinen Nachnamen ändern
Ich könnt nicht mal einen Moment auf dich verzichten
Denn du bist das Ende meiner unendlichen Geschichte
Ohne dich bin ich nicht komplett
Was würd'' ich machen wenn ich dich nicht hätt'?

Ich bleib bei dir solang du mich lässt
Du bist meine Sucht, mein Crystal Meth
Ich lass nicht zu dass man dich verletzt

Summer Cem,"Das ist mein Lebenslauf, lauf um dein Leben, lauf
Weit entfernt sind die Dinge, die ich am nächsten brauch
Um mich rum ist dichter Nebel, doch ich muss nicht mehr rätseln
Als hätt' man mir aus der Goldkette 'nen Strick gehäkelt
Nacht für Nacht war ich kopfgefickt und platt
Oft versucht, es hat trotzdem nicht geklappt
Negativität, Optimisten-Hass, oh bitte lieber Gott gib mir die Kraft
Hallo ihr salutiert, als hätte die Straße mich adoptiert
Home Sweet Home, ich lebe, stehe und falle hier
Der rechte Pfad ist nichts für Cem, denn
Meine Navigation sagt, bitte wenden
Als hätt' ich die Welt in den Händen
Versuch, meine Eltern in Geld zu ertränken
Auch wenns erst beginnt, kann ich das kranke Ende sehen
Als hätt' ich mir die Rolex an mein Handgelenk genäht
Ich komm nicht vor auf eurer Titelseite
Doch alles ist echt, als würd ich mir Wort für Wort aus meiner Rippe schneiden
Soll ich bleiben um zu sehen? Meine Brüder Faysel und Huseyin
Gehen leider einen anderen Weg, die Zeit rennt, aber du stehst

Sind deine Segel schon gehisst, als gäb' es kein Zurück
Dem Himmel so nah´, doch noch siehst du kein Licht
Denn auf dem Weg, auf dem du bist, zähl ich jeden Schritt
Wenn du gehst, nimm mich mit
Nimm mich mit, nimm mich mit
Ich kann dich verstehen, aber nimm mich mit
Egal, wohin die Reise geht, bitte nimm mich mit
Nimm mich mit
Nimm mich mit 
Nimm mich mit 

Alle wollen in die Zeitung
Jeder würde gerne Star sein
Schlagzeilen, aber sitze bei der Arbeit
Kein Bock, aber nicht, dass dir die Wahl bleibt
Schlaf ein, aber träume, wenn ich wach bin
Fakt ist, wir sind alle hier belastet
Wie Ein Mann, der mit einer Pumpgun eine Bank rippt
Oder eine Nutte bei der Nachtschicht
Es ist kalt und ich frier'
Nimm mich mit, denn ich bleibe nicht hier
Ich hab scheinbar kapiert
Bon Appetit, wenn das Leben die wiedermal Scheiße serviert
Wo willst du hin, Scheiße verdammt
Betreten verboten, du weißt nicht wo lang
Sammel dein Mut und such deine Zukunft 
Nur in dir selbst, keiner reicht dir die Hand
Auch wenn die Sonne heut' am hellsten scheint
Ertränkst du dich gleich in Selbstmitleid
Du ist nichts, was am Ende dir bleibt
Probleme sind groß, doch die Welt ist zu klein
Irgendwann mal beginnt der Wahnsinn
Keiner da, der dich in den Arm nimmt
Enttäuscht von so vielen
Doch du hast nicht Laufen gelernt, um heute zu kriechen

Sind deine Segel schon gehisst, als gäb' es kein Zurück
Dem Himmel so nah´, doch noch siehst du kein Licht
Denn auf dem Weg, auf dem du bist, zähl ich jeden Schritt
Wenn du gehst, nimm mich mit
Nimm mich mit, nimm mich mit
Ich kann dich verstehen, aber nimm mich mit
Egal, wohin die Reise geht, bitte nimm mich mit
Nimm mich mit
Nimm mich mit 
Nimm mich mit 

Du bist allein in dieser Stadt, stehst immer noch am Treffpunkt
Keiner holt dich ab, keine Hilfe, keine Rettung
Lass nicht zu, dass das Leben dich fickt
Sag mir einfach nur, wohin und ich nehme dich mit",Nimm Mich Mit,2016
Summer Cem,"Dein innerer Kern ist weich, trotz harter Schale
Dein Kopf macht Randale, ein paar kostbare Jahre
Die du noch hast du hast nicht vor, auf deinem Sofa zu gammeln
Lass uns an die frische Luft und ein paar Vorstrafen sammeln
Deine Ex schreibt SMSen, warum lässt du dich so stressen?
Ich kenn' Dinge, die dir helfen, dein Gedächtnis zu resetten
Lösch den Chatverlauf und setz ein Lächeln auf
Auch wenn du die Kippen jetzt in Ketten rauchst
Ja, die Welt, sie dreht sich weiter, du weißt ganz genau, das stimmt schon
Gedanken spielen Ping-Pong, jedes Mal, wenn frischer Wind kommt
Vergiss nicht, ich bin dein einzig wahrer Freund draußen
Deine Nadel im Heuhaufen

Ich will fliegen
Dann komm, lass uns fliegen
Ich will fliegen
Dann komm, lass uns fliegen

Du paddelst Richtung Horizont und willst die Sorgen alle mitnehmen
Doch sie passen nicht ins Boot rein
Ich bin der Wind in deinen Segeln, die Kraft in deinen Flügeln
Komm, lass mich dein Pilot sein
Ein bisschen Mondschein, ein bisschen Rotwein
Bitte lass mich dein Pilot sein
Jetzt kommt der Durchzug, schnall den Gurt zu
Bitte lass mich dein Pilot sein

Mein Spiegel ist staubbedeckt
Die Wohnung vercrackt, so wie ein Gasherd
Ich nehm' so viel Speed auf, da, wo ich rolle, wächst kein Gras mehr
Kristallhagelnde Tropfen auf die knallfarbene Jordans
Die Schlagader am pochen und an die Wand male ich Hoffnung
Ich will weiter, will höher, will mehr, ich will solche Sachen
An den Wolken kratzen, ich will den Erfolg in Kapseln
Mit so viel Treibstoff schießt du dich gleich ins All
Doch wenn alle Stricke reißen, genieße den freien Fall
Die Zunge kreist umher, ich spür' mein' Mund und wein' nicht mehr
Mein Hund heißt Heisenberg, was bin ich alleine wert?
Du bist mein Pilot, mein einzig wahrer Freund draußen
Meine Nadel im Heuhaufen

Ich will fliegen
Dann komm, lass uns fliegen
Ich will fliegen
Dann komm, lass uns fliegen

Du paddelst Richtung Horizont und willst die Sorgen alle mitnehmen

Ein bisschen Mondschein, ein bisschen Rotwein
Bitte lass mich dein Pilot sein
Jetzt kommt der Durchzug, schnall den Gurt zu
Bitte lass mich dein Pilot sein

Ich war viel zu lang am Boden
Ich will die Stadt von oben sehen
Also flieg' ich jetzt nach oben
Und ich mach's mir dort bequem
Bist du bereit, heut Nacht mit mir über Leichen zu gehen?
Alles und jeden um dich rum nur noch in Zeitlupe sehen

Ich will fliegen
Dann komm, lass uns fliegen
Ich will fliegen

Junge, brich deiner Mutter nicht das Herz
Huh huh huh huh

Die Möglichkeiten lagen in meiner Hand
Aus mir hätte alles werden können
Astronaut, Quantenphysiker, Rechtsanwalt
Poli-ne, Polizist nicht
Aber aus mir hätte so viel werden können 
und ich hab’ es mir geschworen
Diese Hände wurden nicht zum Arbeiten gemacht!
Eh eh Niemals!

Mama sagte „Jungs, macht die Schule fertig!“
Also machte ich die Jungs in der Schule fertig
Doktoranden müssen wählen zwischen Yale oder Harvard
Ich musst’ nur wählen zwischen Gel oder Haarwachs
Die andern sind am Monatsende blank
Doch ich kauf’ dir ein Auto, Mama, auch ohne Diplom an meiner Wand
Denn ich fühl’ mich wohl in diesem Rappergeschäft
Mittags wach werden, ohne dass der Wecker mich weckt
Ich packte meine Kraft in jedes Wort, das ich schrieb
Denn rappen ist ein Knochenjob Orthopädie
Und ich mach’ lieber das, was ich am besten kann
Mein Leben ist ein Film und das hier sind die Actionstunts

Hoch will ich hinaus, die Kohle geb’ ich aus
Ich hab’ keine Rente, doch ich fühl’ mich wohl in meiner Haut
Ich will nicht angeben, aber mein Ansehen ist baba
Wer ist dieser Pink Floyd? Lang lebe Summer!

Du zahlst nichts in deine Rente
Aber Nächte in Hotels
Für Tattoos auf den Armen
Ach, dafür hast du Geld
Wenn deine Oma das hier sehen könnt’
Wär’ sie so enttäuscht
Junge, treib es nicht zu bunt
Das ist uns ’n Hauch zu viel Pink Floyd!

Am Ende hat sich diese ganze Sache noch gelohnt
Komm’ ich auf die Bühne, gehen alle Flossen hoch
Die andern fühlen sich in ihrer Spasti-Rolle wohl
Der Heavymetal-Kanak was ist Rock ’n’ Roll?
Ich könnt’ die Berge besteigen, ich könnt’ die Erde umkreisen
Aber eins könnt’ ich nicht, Bewerbungen schreiben
Wenn du jetzt von mir enttäuscht bist, dann tut es mir leid
Aber ich hatt’ eh nie Ambitionen auf den Pulitzer-Preis
Ich hab’ alles getan, um nicht so wie sie zu sein
Habe ’ne Burg gebaut, nur aus einem Ziegelstein
Ihr wollte ganz nach oben, ich bring’ euch das Fliegen bei
Wenn sie mich heute hassen, muss es wohl aus Liebe sein

Hoch will ich hinaus, die Kohle geb’ ich aus

Ich weiß, dass sie reden, Mama, ach, vergess das
Bla bla, lass die Nachbarn lästern
Obwohl sie einen Scheiß wissen, wollen sie sich einmischen
Aber ich bereu’ es noch nicht mal ein bisschen
Ich bin auf meinem Weg, wohin die Reise geht
Kann ich noch nicht sagen, doch ich bleibe nicht stehen
Ich hoffe ihr versteht, vielleicht ist er nicht okay
Doch ich bin auf meinem Weg, meinem Weg, meinem Weg

Ich steig’ die Siegertreppe rauf, setz’ mein Siegerlächeln auf
Meine Augen funkeln durch den Zigarettenrauch
Sie sind Brüder, wenn ich Porsche fahr’, Brüder, wenn ich Flaschen köpfe
So viele Geschwister, jedes Mal, wenn ich die Kasse öffne
Aber wenn nichts geht, sind sie nun mal nicht in Sicht
Nicht zu finden, selbst wenn du sie in ’ne Suchmaschine tippst, he
Und warum du so ein Judas für mich bist?
Weil ich nichts fühle jedes Mal, wenn du von Bruderliebe sprichst
Wenn ein bisschen Geld in bar genügt, damit du deine Ma’ belügst
Erzähl mir, was du willst, aber erzähl mir nichts von Schamgefühl
Kugeln kosten Leben aber Karma ist umsonst
„Wenn du fällst, fang’ ich dich auf!“, sagte der Beton

An alle Pisser ich sag’ euch, wie der Hase läuft
Ich wurd’ schon mal enttäuscht, doch heute Nacht begrab’ ich euch
Hake dich von der Liste ab, bis Mitternacht, ich töte auf mei’m Siegeszug
Möget ihr in Frieden ruhen! SC!

Falsche Frauen mit falschen Wimpern und falschen Mienen
Sind sich sicher, Natürlichkeit sei die halbe Miete
Sie machen auf First-Lady, sie machen auf Traumfrau
Bitch, ist das Schminke oder trittst du heut als Clown auf?
Verlogen und verdreckt, aber modisch und perfekt
Weil sich ihr hässlicher Charakter leider nicht photoshoppen lässt
Das Leben ist wie Lose ziehen du kannst morgen schon draufgehen!
Aber wer die Rosen liebt, muss die Dornen in Kauf nehmen
Immer wenn es eklig wird (eklig wird), beten wir
Karma ist nicht weit entfernt, sondern auf dem Weg zu dir
Und was ich sage, kann ein Knick in deiner Würde sein
Wenn ihr kein’ Respekt kennt, bring’ ich euch das Fürchten bei

An alle Pisser ich sag’ euch, wie der Hase läuft

Glaub mir, Kecko, du willst nicht in meinen Schuhen stecken
Denn was du siehst sind echte Narben, keine Knutschflecken
Rapper machen Ansagen von NRW bis Memphis
Doch im Nachhinein behaupten sie, es sei ein Missverständnis
Im Endeffekt sind sie am kleben und am gammeln
Ich setze die Szene unter Flammen als würd’ ich Payback-Punkte sammeln
Soll jeder taub werden, der die Mucke von Cem nicht liebt
Trotzdem wird mein Album ausgecheckt wie ’ne Präsidentensuite
Eure fünf Minuten Fame sind euch zu Kopf gestiegen
Ich meine, letztes Jahr noch habt ihr meinen Cock bestiegen
Jetzt, wo es zu spät ist, rufst du an und fragst „Verstehst du mich?“
Weil du weißt, dass der gewünschte Gesprächspartner dein Leben fickt

Es kommt der Tag und du verstehst
Dass du mich unterschätzt hast, doch dann ist es zu spät
Ich hoffe, Gott kann euch verzeihen
Denn ich, ich werde es nie wieder tun
Es tut mir leid!
Ich hoffe, Gott kann euch verzeihen

„Und als ich durch das Tal der Dunkelheit lief, da sah ich sie
Junkies, Zuhälter, Nutten und Schläger
Sie nennen dich Bruder 
Was ist das für ein Bruder, der mit dir am Tisch sitzt
Dir einen guten Appetit wünscht und im selben Moment auf deinen Teller schielt? 
Oh Gott, bitte verzeih ihnen! Sei ihrer Seelen barmherzig 
Denn sie wissen ganz genau was sie tun
Bitte schenk mir die Kraft
Denn ich weiß nicht wie ich meine Nächsten lieben soll
Wenn diese Rapper in ihren Texten deinen unbefleckten Jungen scharfe Irre führen wollen
Mit ihren geliehenen Rolex-Uhren in Videos protzen
Aber nicht wissen, dass die Zeit gekommen ist, um Rechenschaft abzulegen
Führe sie auf den rechten Weg und damit mein’ ich nicht die A40 Richtung Venlo, Gott
Oh nein, ich meine deinen rechten Weg! Oh Schwester
Bist du dir denn selbst nicht zu schade für Duckface-Fotos auf Facebook? 
Und du kleiner Bruder lass dich nicht lenken von diesen Hurensohn-Rappern
Verzeih mir meine Ausdrucksweise, oh Herr
Lasst uns beten für all die verlorenen Seelen
Um sie endlich zu erleuchten
Wie viel kann ein Mensch tragen, wenn er kein Rückgrat hat? 
Bitte Herr, vergib ihnen! Hab Gnade!

Mit Gewichten, die sonst nur ein Gabelstapler hebt
Auf der Straße hab ich fame, ich mach' G-Rap mit Flow
Für ein' Rear Naked Choke ist mein Bizeps zu groß
Ah, ich mach' der Sängerin Ciara Kids
Und danach fick ich eine Bitch, und zwar Sierra Kidds
Kurz darauf hat die Bitch in ihrem Hintern Penis drin
Und ich 'ne Anzeige - Verführung von Minderjährigen
Bin im Zerlegen King und geh' ich scheißen in 'nem Zug
Bringt es mir mehr als eine Seite in der JUICE
Und warum sich die Kugeln in deiner Brust befinden
Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort im Bus ganz hinten
Hunde, die bellen, beißen nicht, sagen ein paar im Viertel
Doch Hunde, die bellen, werden am meisten gefürchtet
Asphalt Massaka, der Pate 5, Bitch
2 Milionen Euro, mein Jahresrückblick

Asphalt Massaka, die Trilogie, ich steche dir in deine Givenchy
Ich hab gehört, dass du in Wien auf krass Kanake da machst
Aber in Deutschland bleibst du 'ne Fliege, wie'n Krawattenersatz
Alles Fotzen, außer KC Danke für die Props
Und diese Aussage, doch ihr bleibt Fotzen, ohne Ausnahme
Die Fans haben es gemerkt, dass ihr Heuchler seid
Ihr habt null Loyalität in eurem Freundeskreis
Ihr zeigt euch gegenseitig an und so'n Scheiß
Also irgendwie müsst ihr doch charakterlos sein
Banger-Bro, jeder meiner Crew ist krasser
Die Rebell-Lounge wischt sich mit der JUICE den Arsch ab
Hip-Hop-Medien supporten sanftere Kerle
Denn unsere Schwänze sind zu lang für ihre Ärsche
Ihr unterschreibt bei 'nem Major 'n Deal (Ah, SC, ah)
Und verkauft dann die Hälfte von mir

Jeder hält ein Gewehr, B-A-N-G-E-R
Hurensohn, du machst auf Moslem mit dei'm Bart
Doch wenn's um's Eingemachte geht
Bestellst du dir das Schweinenackensteak
Der King, der Champ, der Chief, sitze mit der Gang im Jeep
Fahren nach Berlin, 'ne Runde Klingelmännchen spiel'n
Merhaba, ich komm' mit annormalen Songs
Und begrüße Rapper mit einem Scha-la-la-la-la-lom
Das ist nicht der Thron, auf dem du Penner grad sitzt
Rapper brauche keinen Flow, sondern 'nen Herrenhaarschnitt
Aha, aha, jeder, der denkt, dass er im Showbiz on top sei
Kriegt von mir das Solingen rostfrei
Oglum, du willst Stress
Ich steh' vor deiner Wohnung mit der Tec
Du kleine Fotze mit Napoleon-Komplex
Bestell' Champagner, denn er ist nach acht Gläsern leer
Dankeschön an unser'n Gastgeber Fler, yeah

Jasko, es ist immer noch der Dreckskanake
Ich ficke B-Tights Mutter wie auf meiner letzten Platte
Der Betrugo hier ist immer noch G
Und deine Mom ist wie Boom Beach, ich hab die Finger im Spiel
Ich seh' nur reihenweise Lutscher, und ich rede nicht von Facebook
Wenn ich sage, wir teilen deine Mutter
Crackdealer Sound für den Häftling im Bau
Ich hol' mehr Fotzen vor die Kamera als Backspin TV
Eine Gatling im Bau, ich mach' alles, außer Spaß
G-Hot, deine Mutter, sie macht alles, außer Arsch
Die Bitch gibt sich Becks in der Wohnung wie ein Penner
Und dein Vater ist 'ne ipne, Homosexueller
Ich zog Novoline im Keller und hab Titten in der Hand
Etwas Lippenstift am Schwanz, ich muss ficken wie ein Mann
Yeah, Banger Musik, echter G-Rap auf deutsch
Fler bleibt ein Hurensohn, auch wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft

Yeah, eyo, Asphalt Massaka 3, ich hab wieder Blut geleckt
Milfhunter-Style, reife Mütter suchen guten Sex
Im Mund von dieser Gina ficken und zwar so tief, bis meine Eier
An ihrem Kinn hängen und sie aussieht wie Peter Griffin
Wieder spitten, du sitzt ahnungslos auf dem Sofa
Willst deine Bitch zurückerobern und trinkst Pisse mit Cola
(Haha) Fick auf Schule, Bruder, jetzt sind Wörter meine Waffe
Als ich wusste, wie man Geld zählt, hab ich aufgehört mit Mathe
Oberbilk, Mann, hier laufen keine Gangs auf Straßen
Um deine Bitch zu haben, muss man mit Paypal zahlen
Denn sie macht Cybersex für Kokaina
Und ist jederzeit eh on, wie Stromanbieter
Finanzamt fickt, doch ich bin am Tricksen - Uri Geller
Und mit Absätzen beschäftigt, wie ein Damenschuhhersteller
Fick die Stars von heute und dein Alter Ego
Ich fick Nazibräute auf Pegida-Demos

M-A-J, ich schieß' auf Schore-Junks
Meine Frau trägt nur noch Röcke
Damit keiner behauptet, sie hätte die Hosen an
Komm' ich mit Turban, du Homo, dann wird es eskalieren
Wie der erfinder vom Sturmstaffel-Logo
Packe die Langhantelstange, habe die Kur in mir drin
Und klatsche deine gesamte Bande im Uhrzeigersinn
Dieser MOK klaut wieder Chips liegt auf der Couch und er frisst
Weil sein Bauch fetter ist als der Mount Everest
Merk' dir, dass dich das Label mit dem Boxhandschuh killt
Er ist so fett, dass ihn nicht einmal die Bosst-TraFo hilft
Bitch, mein Herz ist aus Stahl, sag mir, wer macht auf hart?
Dann beißt er halt ins Gras, wie'n Pferd oder Schaf
Du würdest gern in meiner Haut stecken, so wie Testo-Spritzen
Ich bin auf 180, wie ein gestreckter Winkel

Summer Cem,"Nach den Talfahrten beginnen die schönen Zeiten
Dieses Land bietet jedem Mensch die Möglichkeiten
Es gibt keinen Ansporn in Hamborn, der Fokus fehlt
Alle wollen sogesehen ohne 'nen Job die Kronjuwelen
Wenn du durch Disziplin und Fleiß mal dein Ziel erreichst
Ist es Zufriedenheit, was dir der Spiegel zeigt
Hast du dir diese Frage heut schon gestellt, hast du? 
Warst du treu zu dir selbst, hä?
Wieso sollte ich mich eigentlich beschweren, wieso?
Vielleicht bin ich schon mit dreißig Millionär, vielleicht
Mag schon sein, dass es eh nicht funktioniert, mag sein
Ich hab' es wenigstens probiert

Brudi, ich bin seit Jahren bei Arge
Du fragst, wie es läuft? Ich lauf in Cani-Versace
Ich zähle jeden Cent, jeden Euro, jeden Dollar
Der Weg, auf dem ich mich befinde, ist kein ehrenvoller
Wen ich mal heirate, hängt ab von den Miss-Wahlen
Wenn ich mein Leben schon verpenne, dann im Ritz-Carlton
Ich lass mir nichts mehr von 'nem Bastard erzählen
Der weder 'ne Goldgette noch 'ne Yachtmaster trägt
Nichts baut dich auf, nur das Geld kann dir Halt schenken (Nur das Geld!)
Ich wuchs auf mit Makhluqs und mit Halbmenschen (Whooh!)
Warum sollt' ich spar'n? Auf die Rente scheiß' ich!
Denn Leute meiner Sorte sterben schon Ende dreißig

Sag mir, warum du so blind bist!
Wo willst du hin mit dieser Lebensart?
Alles dreht sich, mir wird schwindlig
Reiß' meine Augen auf, doch ich sehe nur schwarz
Dunkles Schwarz ist, was ich seh, ständig komm' ich ab vom Weg
Deine Richtung ist 'ne and're, also bitte lass mich gehen!
Du siehst immer nur Profit, alles dreht sich um Gewinn
Doch ich weiß, dass du verlierst, denn im Kopf bist du ein Kind
Warum bist du nur so blind?
Warum bist du nur so blind?
Warum bist du nur so blind?
Warum bist du nur so blind?

Brudi, wie läuft's? Wie soll es laufen? Standard!
Lang nicht gesehen! Wir dachten, du wärst ausgewandert
Ich komm' grad aus Mailand vom Shoppen mit den Weibern
Was geht bei dir? Ich hab' am Wochenende Freigang!
Für ein Strandhaus mit Pool hab' ich ein'n Bankraub versucht
Mittlerweile bin ich mit jedem Pfandhaus perdu
Warum hast du nichts gesagt? Ich hätte dich im Knast doch besucht
Ach, ist nicht schlimm, Bruder, leih mal jetzt ein'n Fuffziger, wa-llāh, kriegste nächste Woche
Hier hast du fünfhundert gegen die Finanzkrise
Hoddie von DSQUARED, die Milch ist von Landliebe
Mein Zellennachbar ist echt nett und ein Schwarzkopf
Er schmuggelt mir das iPhone 6 in seinem Arschloch
Mein Nachbar übertreibt auch, ich sag ihm „Mach nicht so!“
Denn er schenkte mir Tickets für das El Clásico
El Clásico? Kein Plan, wer so'n Scheiß guckt!
Ich hab Zeitdruck, denn gleich ist wieder Einschluss
Und dann seh' ich meine Freunde wieder
Keine Sorge, Majoe, bei mir läuft, Highlife, Dolce Vita
Jaja, Dolce Vita, während du im Knast sitzt
Und lass mich raten, das Loch im Shirt ist Absicht
Kümmer dich um dein eigenen Scheiß, ja?
Und die fufzig Euro

Was für fünfzig Euro?
Ich hab dir fünfhundert gegeben, Mann!
Aber weißte was? Lass stecken

Dreimonatige Promophase, danach abtauchen und offline
Zwölf Monate Massephase für den Körperbau wie Tim Wiese
Acht Zylinder unter der Motorhaube, das ist bar bezahlt und nicht Miete

Take you a vitamin boy and stick to your diet and tore it
Keep risin' and soarin', don't put your mind on the evil
Keep your eye on the people who would kill just to be by you
And beware of those who appear to be dyin' to meet you
Let your therapy be The Bible and let yourself just be legendary
And just continue to keep on helpin' the less fortunate
Not for no fuckin' credit in public but for the blessings above
Most important lesson I learned was just to love (true)

All day you hear UZI, choppers and nines too
All day you niggas eat sushi, sausage and fondue

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Immortal we stand
On the hills where the dragon flies

Hold your shield high, let the wind bring your enemy your nightmare

And grass beneath the sun

The lakes shall shine and burn

Sun & the Moon,"We walked in the cold air - 
Freezing breath on the window pain
Lying waiting

A man in the dark in the picture frame
So mystic and soulful.
A voice reaching out and a piercing cry

It stays with you until
The feeling is gone
only you and I
This means nothing to me

This means nothing to me

Oh Vienna -

The music is weaving -
Haunting notes pizzicato strings

The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings a cold empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky

It fades to the distance.

The image is gone
only you and I
This means nothing to me

This means nothing to me

Oh Vienna -

This means nothing to me

This means nothing to me

Oh Vienna.

Sun Airway,"You’d put an end to an empty sky
I think you want it to come down
From bank to bank you drift endless
Why call out to me now?

Don’t want to be the string you keep all up in knots only you can untie

I think you want it to come down
You put an end to an empty sky

And say you’ve never known love like this before
I say I’ve never known loneliness like this
You’ve never known loneliness before
Because you’ve never been alone with my love my love

I tried to get close to you
I tried to get close to you

So you slowly split your two lips
And the words spill out like ribbon
You give me teenage poetry
You think it comes across like Dylan

You say you’ve never known love like this before
I say I’ve never known loneliness like this
You’ve never known loneliness before
Because you’ve never been alone with my love, my love

I tried to get close to you
I tried to get close to you

You say you’ve never known love like this before
I say I’ve never known loneliness like this
You’ve never known loneliness before
Because you’ve never been alone with my love, my love

You say you’ve never known love like this before
I say I’ve never known loneliness like this
You’ve never known loneliness before
Because you’ve never been alone with my love, my love

Turned around and saw a white man's face covered in shades
I must've passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out
Three more niggas approachin' holdin' they macs out
One spoke, gave me the keys to a boat, reached in his trenchcoat 
And pulled out a yellow envelope
Which contained twenty thousand in cash, 
A photograph of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache Miguel Sanchez, 
Keep a gun hidden in his pants' leg with armed bodyguards, 
Surveillance around his land spread
He runs a billion dollar organization under investigation, 
Plus he's wanted by immigration
Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement, 
How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents? 
They knew my background, knew about what happened out in Sac-town, 
They knew about the rap down South, they laid the facts down
Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel, 
Or spend the rest of my life in prison
A classified mission on some James Bond shit, 
007-style up against some straight convicts
Now I'm pondering, thoughts wandering,

They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all
But me and Trife doin' right together,

[Sun God]
Aiyo, I post up, packed the shotti
Black mags in lobbies, with red dots, to detach the body
If you a boss, why ya cash is sloppy?
This a Staten Island burglar gang, ock, not no Ave could stop me
I'm on the road, not no massive robbery
When it come to that dough, it over flow like paper bag tsunamis
I take shit, lumberjacks and Tommy's
Niggaz passing out bombs like Culpepper, so I pass behind 'em
My black glove, black mask, requirements
Sent the order to Trife Dies', and he gon' send 'em fast, they flying in
These cowards couldn't clash our lion's den
That forty-four mag'll twist ya aves and the cav you flying in
We hoping out cabs like Iron Men
It's hard to believe how niggaz leave with no bag supplying sense
Empty cuz my staff is hiring
Canine dogs with felonies duck fast when firing

[Trife Da God]
Aiyo, we carry arms like a octopus
Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book
Blowing all lots of kush
Dark tints on the V so the D's can't spot the crooks
Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks
Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves
Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes
Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used
I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move
If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im
Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im
Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing
We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen
With stones so we decided to yapp 'im
I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action
These ain't E pills, nigga, these is fuckin aspirin
Bean, blast 'im, Homo' get his girl for his cash and
Yo, E, go stop the whip, they 'bout to witness a slashing"" (BOY!)",Yapp City,2007

I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Fell on her pages found me well
On her words I don't know what

Warm canals and pools clear blue
Where Tuscarawas flow into

To where the highway met
Dead end tracks

And far away

What about what's good what's true
From those days

All the lovers I've burned through
So why do I still burn for you
I can't say

Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough in these last days

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, Ohio

Children bless
And gather round the bed she rests
So poor and cold in their Midwest
Moon and sun

Flashes bringing on
My open eyes to lightning storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

A million miles ago you seem
A star that I just don't see

It was second class but what's to lose
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time

She still got plenty lonely but that's just isn't the case

Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon

When morning doves appear
And ghosts of April ring
Echo the refrain
Soon finding a place

Ducking out the window, the school I hate
Listening to my mother talking with her neighborhood friends
Underneath the drone guitar of lucky man

Stranded out those Florida beaches, poor as a joke
Sails fly in Merritt Islands, lazy blue coast
Cool refrains of ocean rain, echo off of my head
Celebrated summer, friends and brothers, the freedom we fell
And you're what I remember

Shining down the L.A. highways, glorious sun
Far from you, from my home, and everyone I love
Sinking in the shallow end of her infinite pools
Silver lakes and palisades and Malibu

Woken up those lost young mornings, somewhere in Spain
I couldn't say the towns I slept, my lovers' names
Pouring in on Sunday, heaven's church bell rang
I didn't know my purpose till I stood and sang
For crowds of passing faces

Woken up to this new Aprils sleepy gray skies
The rain has swept the dust that left, the gutters rise
The fog it spills into the hills, crawling out East
The windows weep, beside me now though she sleeps and I
Now have I found her",Lucky Man,2008
Sun Kil Moon,"Her window looked out on North Church Street
An attic space overgrown
A photo-book of smiling friends
Road maps, New York, Los Angeles
Her walls are Mediterranean blue
Her baby sister picked the hue
Saltwater taffy, Jersey shore
Blue like the fingernails she wore

Her house is not far from the school
Her mom taught on the Hudson
Her dad's guitar sings open tunes
Reverberates up through the floor
Our love grew more one summer there
We'd spend our days just driving round
Old parking lots and neighborhoods
Are framed and charmed in Moorestown

I followed her across the Earth
Through parks in London, coasts of Perth
Newport, Kentucky and New Orleans
We shared a million lives it seems
I slept with her so many nights
We moved together heavenly
So close the North Pacific slept
You too were once beside me

She moved away to Williamsburg
Her eyes sad as a raven
My thoughts will pause, my throat will swell
When her name is spoken
And looking past the cold, long sea
I cannot bear to wonder now
If the cascading soft lights
Are glowing for us in Moorestown
Are glowing for us in Moorestown",Moorestown,2008
Sun Kil Moon,"I walked the old eroded streets
A million miles now have gone behind me
Walked in the room, soaked up its fumes
Surveyed the faces I am lying to

Gave what I had, I gave my heart
Though I was broken and falling apart
Gave for the memory of a friend
Not for myself and not for them

When I was done I met someone
She came in from the storm so bright and welcome
Her friends came and swept her away
Disappeared like coyotes off on dark high plains

I looked across the river so still
Trying to remember
Where it was last night I laid my head to sleep
Where the empty night hung heavily over

I left Bilbao went to Madrid
To Barcelona, to Pamplona
Where every ghost runs in me now
Haunting me

I flew in over the red clay roofs
And floated through the clouds as they swallowed shut
The bronze tinted landing sea
And houses row the hills like yellowing teeth

When we touched down, opened my eyes to the sun
The dizzying air filled my lungs
And just as soon she woke me
My eyes blurry, my mind heavy

I left Milan I went to Rome
And carried her aroma to Verona
And all the kindness she had shown
Was only a dream

The Flurries down storm cold gray too?
The frozen nights where ignored souls live
As last rays of daylight died
I'm going into my head and clearing my eyes

And as the train pulled away from Cologne
The noise down wire so loudly that it groaned
And as the engines burned through the night
I stared off at far-away lights

I left Berlin and I came home
To sleeping potions and blue oceans
Where my love so selflessly
Awaited me

I long to feel her light so warm
My thoughts racing to the places
Where her room invited me
Awaited me

As the ocean brings in its high tide
As the darkness sets upon the beach
As we drive we look out at black ends
Growing to our windows in old bored stream

Over the bridge, the city sparkles so bright
A hungry stomach smell brings strife
Dim light a television blaring softly
And here the perfect night as fog horns sing",Tonight in Bilbao,2008
Sun Kil Moon,"Her head lay back in blankets soft white down
Her hair warm Autumn colors, floating
Our days were classroom poems, true young love
Some nights we roar like lions, some we coo like doves

I left her long ago one summer, chasing dreams
I hummed good sweet explosions? sweet nothings
I broke her heart not knowing she'd return
And graven scars deep in me, forever

I hear my sleeping sister
In the early morning hours
I hear her though it's silent
Standing over me now

Tonight the skies
Will open for you
Mountains and big clouds
Divide us in two

She fell into his arms, his sweet strong kiss
She made her perfect gardens in this?
World that turned its back, shook things round
In time it took our loving sister down

I met my fallen Angel one last time
I promised always through me she would shine
I held her hands, I sunk into her heart
Till powers unrelenting, pulled us apart

I saw my sleeping sister
Rising toward a light
A mist above the skyline
On that never ending night

Tonight bright stars
Are shining for you
Oceans and full moons
Deep midnight blue

I woke up every morning
Not believing her to be gone
Outside the doves and sparrows
Carried on

Building now so sweetly
Settled into spring
Outside the kids in their yards
Laughing ?

I loved you like no other
Your eyes I can't erase
Your voice it wakes me always
Pouring down from space

Like warm sun rays
You're turning into
Wind sails on cool bays
I'm watching for you

Tonight the skies
Are open for you
Mountains and big clouds
Dividing in two",Tonight the Sky,2008
Sun Kil Moon,"Come out from the burning fire butterfly
Let me lock you in my room and keep you
For a while
Could you be the answer to my every prayer?
Could you be the one for who I care?

Come into my arms and let your worries die
Come out from the web of all your tangles lies
But be true to me and I'll be true to you
Judge me not for what I've done but what I'll do

A million nights have led
To this one that we are spending
And I know it's better here
Than anywhere I've been going
With every morning grew
A void more wide and endless

Come out from the burning fire butterfly
Let me lock you in my room and keep you
For a while
You watch over me and I'll watch over you
And if you go tomorrow choke me till I'm blue

Sun Kil Moon,"Don't cry my love don't cry no more
A crashing sky a rolling screen
A city drowning Gods black tears
I cannot bear to see

She lay under the midnight moon
Her restless body stirring
Until the magic morning hour
Like poison it succumbs her

Her baby skin her old black dress
Her hair it twists round her necklace
Constricts and chokes like ruthless vines
To sleep she overtakes her?

Her room is painted Heron Blue
Lit by candlelight and chandelier
And from her headboard perched so high
A million dreams have passed her

Don't cry my love don't cry no more
It overwhelms my breaking heart
A minor swell of violins
I cannot bear to hear them

A mother shepherds her young birds
she fills their mouths and warms their souls
Til they are strong and good to fly
Away from her alone she'll die

Cradle on quiet old oak limbs
As heaven blue her light fails
A breath of soot into her lungs
A life, a journeys end in one

Don't sing that old sad hymn no more
It resonates inside my soul
It haunts me in my waking dream
I cannot bear to hear it

Don't play those violins no more
Their melancholic overtones
They echo off the floor and walls
I cannot bear to hear them",Half Moon Bay,2010
Sun Kil Moon,"In my room at Third and Seneca
See the pigeons peck on tall roof tops
Homeless on the corners, they carouse

Scenesters with their beards and tennis shoes
Skinny girls and pudgy ugly dudes
Lift their amplifiers from the ditches
Southern doormen brood in barroom witches
Seattle black, Alaska blue
Oregon grey, raincloud Vancouver
Dead in Denver, drowsy Idaho
Just dreams away from your love, San Francisco
In my room at Laurel and Beverly

Dark cities, you fill the loss
Of the day
You are my love
Radiant and pretty, over seas
You find ways of bringing hope
The lonely hours, gloom of night
Empty mornings
You are a stem, of wild flowers
Rollin' hills, 'round the bay
You are a gap
In the meadow, soaring low
In this way, you are my friend
In the shadows, there to bring
When I need
You are the suites
Of the cellos
There to mend, if I bleed
You are a swing
Sleepy porches, the warm light
On my face
You are a charge, of wild horses
You are the sun
You are my sun

Over the mountains

A blanket by a broken vent
She's there a while
And then she's gone

I'm away for weeks
Arrive at night
She hears my steps
Turns off the light and runs

No mind at all, more space than I need
It's just me among the weeds
Among the ghosts
Among the leaves

We've never met but she's a girl
Romance paper books
The floor is covered
In long blonde curls

On afternoons I walk the graves
The rusted cars, the mine shaft caves
See a girl sadly unkempt
A child of neglect

Under moons I pass the tombs
Cross the highways, smell the fumes
See a girl frighteningly gaunt
Somebody didn't want
How do I tell her I don't care
If she sleeps downstairs?

I see her on my errand runs
Looking nervous like a young Mia Farrow
Walk along the gas stops
Window browsing pawn shops
Guns, bows and arrows

Past the signs Eighty South

Drinking Wild Irish Rose
At the dead end of the road

They said you’d gone code silver
They sent the police out searchin'
Found you down at Fifth and Minna
High on crack cocaine
You and Juan Valdez
They sent him back to jail
And they put you back to bed
They called in the mornin' 
Said you were found outside
And put the phone down
Your cat jumped on my lap
And I laid down and I took a nap
Feelin' bad and full of shame
That I somehow contributed to your pain
I wish I could help you with your problems
But babe, I got enough of my own

I fell asleep and dreamed of you
The PA said code blue
I hailed a taxicab
Got there and found you up in west two
My beautiful sweet Elaine
All that was killin' you finally drained
From your sweet angelic face
And I knelled down
And whispered your name

I cried and I cried
You crawled and found a corner
And you died
I ought to kiss my sweet Elaine goodbye
And I walked out in the rain
I walked out in the rain
And there you were again
Lookin' down on me from high
Like a cloud in the sky

I cried and I cried
I remembered all the nights
That I loved my sweet Elaine 
And that I kissed my sweet Elaine
And then I looked up high
Saw you floatin' in the sky
And I cried and I cried
Like a baby I cried

Not much to pick from in my view
Trees that shake when the wind comes through
And boats, I guess, and the water is blue
But I only feel alive when the birds fly

Not much to pick from in my record collection
I sold 'em all away, don’t want no recollection
I put 'em in the past, don’t wanna hear the songs
Just wanna play guitar and sing my own

The phone rang, I picked up, it was you

We shared a cigarette, a kiss goodbye

To bottles and objects around the room

We didn't have very much to say
She said that she'd come from some other place
A town called Troyskirt, maybe Troysworth
I was pretty distracted packing my stuff
But I did make a point to ask her to stay
But she said she had friends that she had to go see

Later that summer I picked up my mail
She sent me a letter with a touching detail

To find you that night but to no avail""

And I just got in the door from Ontario
And I'm going on tomorrow

Got myself a foot massage and a manicure too
And I looked up at the marquee
And hey, it was my name
Next to Julie Holland, think that was her name

It was eight or nine siblings I am told that he had
When summertime came, his parents put him on a bus
And sent him to his Uncle's in Chicago for three months

Sunshine in Chicago makes me feel pretty sad
My band played here a lot in the nineties when we had
Lots of female fans and fuck, they all were cute
Now, I just sign posters for guys in tennis shoes

No itching or burning like I got the other time

On dark December days, I think of all my friends
From Washington to Maine, New York to Sweden

The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake

When the edge of surrender's in sight

Don't you worry
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I'm always ready
I won't let you out of my sight

I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready, forever and always
I'm always here

In us we all have the power
But sometimes it's so hard to see
And instinct is stronger than reason
It's just human nature to me

Don't you worry
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I'm always ready
I won't let you out of my sight

When we do them haters frown, nigga turn the heat down
I know we skip the line and bitches think we fine
I know you feelin' drunk and tough, but you best recline
You don't wanna get stained it's pain in this lane
I'mma check they temperature, they all up in my mix, mayne

I just come to kick it with the bitches, I ain't come for you
If you really want it, yeah my homies got a gun or two
I take on every one of you, what you wanna do?
Don't forget I got this whole club on my side trippin' is dumb'a you
Stop, everybody what's that sound?
It sound like a hater 'bout to get the beat down
With the quick and why they wanna go and get me pissed
When they know I'm with me clique and a real nigga like Mitchy Slick
On this Hennessy, Sprite and lemon, fuck these niggas, invite the women
Busters wanna insight the grimin', now you gotta invite the crimin-nals
Don't gimme that bullshit, nigga don't gimme no looks
You better get over the shit, a veteran knowin' that you pathetic
And let 'em fuck up and hit me on kush
So you better snap your fingers and then rock with it

Who am I? KC Boss bitch, what you doin'? Tryin' to snap back
A hundred degrees, I'm heated, eat it, like it was your dinner roll
You've never been a friend to me, bitch better check yo temperature
I'll block you like rocky on cocky, catch a lot of bodies

Ain't nobody trippin' off of you, I just wanna kick it and be cool
Half of these niggas are up in this motherfucker wanna be part of the crew

The vast and sacred valley

I saw a woman who approached me

She had old, wise, tired eyes
And markings on her cheeks

Could be achieved

The haze of my lucid dreams

To use my head and crack it open

Away from the crying churned up storm
I saw a land through the deepening dusk
And I knew true, what I had been told

I want this vibrant grass to cover me
If I become too overwrought
For the salvation that I seek
Is trapped in the silence between my thoughts

Your part is so convincing
You pray somebody knew
The loneliness inside is more than you can bear,
When you look into a mirror
There's really no one there
But a person you want to be,
An image you long to see,
There's a hidden person
In your heart trying to get through
Somebody loves you, somebody does you know

You are loved, you are loved",Somebody Loves You,1995

So many snake ass niggas, who's to trust
Trustin' one of these niggas will get my head bust
I trust in my dog and my gun cause them the one that I know for sho'
Is gonna make sure got harmed by no one, by no one

[Sundown]
So many snake ass niggas I come around with my trigger
And V and the Sundown, playboy how did ya figure
Ya supposed to be dog, do whatever fuck the stormy weather
If I had beef and you had beef we put the shit together

Which ever was clever, I spoiled to the depths
They wouldn't take yo breath
Without a retaliatin' rippin' someone's chest
Into the flesh, leavin' a bloody mess

Could ya picture bullets flyin', niggas dyin'
Families cryin' cause I thought this nigga was tryin' to take mine
Shit gets better and you can imagine
I got mad love for ya but it ain't that kind of passion

It's the kind where .357 be blastin'
Niggas be duckin' and passin'
Behind the ones I love so much, shit gettin' drastic
I can't have it like I can't have it

Behind my back runnin' ya mouth like that
Get cha' shit straight to the fact
Let's see what the fuck possessin' you to think like that
And where the courage came from for you to pull off that act

[Hook]

[Kane & Abel]
I was brought up by snakes, taught me to survive in the grass
Use one eye to watch your friend the other watch your ass
Let no man be excused from suspicion when something missin'

Listen to his story but when he guilty become victim
Quick descions get cha' post cut short
Get cha' filled with cha' mind, keep it with much heart
Business is yankin'

Fuck with strays and ya family, friends
And money mix like mayonaise and cotton candy
Strangely the roots of all evil
Could easily be the fruits for all people

Anything with a life got a price
If it can't be bought, it can be knocked off for a pair of Nikes
Tight as times is ya mind is ya weapon
Keep it when ya steppin' use it when ya threatened

A blessing from God can never be taken
By the hands of a man who can never understand
You sucker ass snakes

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1996

Sunni Patterson,"And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing
But it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down
And tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken
The joy they tried to take it
Mama said that
""The best thing you can do and be is you
This world ain't got but one
So give credit where it is due""
Ain't that the truth
And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness
Let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day
Let the god have his say
'Cause there's a place that you can go
No one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud
So high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search
'Cause love is all around

Yeah!
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate
Sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas s***
And when it's cold outside
So your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucet
Drip, f*** the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you
The hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you
They say the flattery is sincere
I run like a n**** younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that b**** like I'm selling coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade

Alone, is all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need, you need, I feel you

Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking
They need Summer's Eve
I practised repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze
Dad kept us in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them local jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this
Underscore, it's just me and Goat
Dirty a** n****s, we'll sell your a** a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to be me

Alone, is all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe

But now I'm what you need, you need, I feel you",Black Unicorn,2013

The dress I ruined with the soda pop?
I barely recognized the girl next door

Long hot days, Blue sea haze
Juke box plays, but now it's fading away.

I guess you don't remember anything!

Must not be so bad at home

She's nothing like the things you said
The woman you described
Couldn't even turn your head

Just to see a dream come true
So God bless the boys who make the noise
On 16th Avenue

With a million dollar spirit
And an old flattop guitar
They drive to town with all they own
In a hundred dollar car

Cause one time someone told 'em
About a friend of a friend they knew
Who owns you know a studio
On 16th Avenue

Now some were born to money
They've never had to say ""survive""
And others swing a 9 pound hammer
Just to stay alive

There's cowboys drunks and christians
Mostly white and black and blue
They've all dialed the phone collect to home
From 16th Avenue

Ah, but one night in some empty room
Where no curtains ever hung
Like a miracle some golden words rolled
Off of someone's tongue

And after years of being nothing
They're all looking right at you
And for a while they'll go in style
On 16th Avenue

It looked so uneventful
So quiet and discreet
But a lot of lives where changed
Down in that little one way street

Set out for Abilene and I made it half way

Cause when I get on track, I ain't lookin' back

If I could make my living going fishing

Then I would make my living with a line and pole

",If I Could,2006
Sunny Sweeney,"She grew up plain and simple in a farming town.
Her daddy played the fiddle 
And used to do the calling when they had hoedowns.
She said the neighbors would come 
And they'd move all my grandma's furniture 'round.
And there'd be twenty or more there on the old wooden floor, 
Dancin' to a country sound.

The carters and Jimmy Rodgers played her favorite songs.
And on Saturday nights there was a radio show and she'd sing along.
I'll never forget her face when she revealed to me,
That she'd dreamed about singing at the grand ol' opry.

Her eyes, oh, how they sparkled 
When she sang those songs.
She was hanging the clothes on the line, 
I was a kid just a hummin' along.
Well, I'd be playing in the grass, to her, 
What might've seemed, obliviously.
There ain't no doubt about it, 
She sure made her mark on me.

She played old gospel records on the phonograph.
She turned them up loud and we'd sing along, 
How those days have passed.
Just now that I am older it occurs to me,
That I was singing in the grandest opry.

And we sang sweet rose of Sharon, abide with me,
'til I ride the gospel ship to heaven's jubilee.
And in that great triumphant morning my soul will be free,
And my burdens will be lifted when my savior's face I see.

So I don't want to get adjusted to this world below,
But I know he'll pilot me 'til it comes time to go.
Oh, nothing on this earth is half as dear to me,
As the sound of my mama's opry

And we sang sweet rose of Sharon, abide with me,
'til I ride the gospel ship to heaven's jubilee.
And in that great triumphant morning my soul will be free,
And my burdens will be lifted when my savior's face I see.

So I don't want to get adjusted to this world below,
But I know he'll pilot me 'til it comes time to go.
Oh, nothing on this earth is half as dear to me,
As the sound of my mama's opry",Mama's Opry,2006

Somebody's honey been away too long

Somebody waitin' at home

Somebody's learnin' that they're not so strong

Sittin' there dreamin' alone

Well nothin' seems to matter since it's been like this

Nothin' seems to move me at all

My heart's about to shatter 'cause we last kissed

Hangin' on from call to call


Chorus:

And hopin' please be San Antone

Please be on the phone

Send your love back home to me


Anything you tell me's gonna be OK

Anyway the words wanna walk

Any news is good news that I hear you say

We could talk about the weather, talk about the dog

Just enough to hear you take another breath

Just enough to soften the fall

I'm gonna make my day until the next sunset

Hold me back from climbin' the wall


Repeat Chorus x2 except


Send your love back home to me

Send your love back home to me

Swore I'd never come back here

I'm drivin' east to face my fears

Headin' back down to my home town

And fightin' back the tears


I'm closin' in on your memory

The Friday night lights and your back seat

Young, Naive, and livin' on faith

I knew we'd be together always

Together always


Small town smell is creepin' in

Reminds me of what we were back when

Ten years pass and nothin's changed

This Texas town is still the same


That small town smell is creepin' in

Reminds me of what we were back when

Ten years pass and nothin's changed

This Texas town is still the same


There's no use denyin' what I'm doin' here

There's still no reason after all these years

Heard some where that you moved on

I guess that old flame is good as gone


I walk in you're standin' with your wife

While I'm still lookin' for the love of my life

You and this town in the back of my mind

Since I left you both behind

I left you both behind

Reminds me of what we were back when

Ten years pass and everything's changed

But this old heart is still the same


Well this old heart is still the same

Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears

We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realized there's nothing on our side

Out of my life, Out of my mind
Out of the tears we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind
Out of my head, Out of my bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad
Tell them it's me who made you sad
Tell them the fairytale gone bad

Another night and I bleed
They all make mistakes and so did we
But we did something we can never turn back right

Find a new one to fool
Leave and don't look back, I won't follow
We have nothing left, it's the end of our time

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
There's no more rabbits in my hat to make things right

Out of my life, Out of my mind
Out of the tears we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride

Please don't throw me away
Please don't throw me away
Please don't throw me away

They can't get her skin and the sweet laughter

My girl is mine
Can't you see she's loving just me
It's obvious you cannot win with me

Every day every way she is my little pie
She is just treating me right
And I'd do anything just to keep her safe

You can look, you can undress her in your minds
You can look but you can't bite
You can't take my princess away, you snakes

For a few days
But don't you worry
'Cause I'll call you
Like it's not
Long distance
'Cause I hate being away
I hate being away from you 
I gotta go
Even though I don't want to
I'd rather stay 
Than to be away from you

Since absence
Has been known to 
Make the heart grow fonder 
Then you know 
That I miss you 
And this song 
Is just a reminder 
I hate being away 

[Chorus: ]
I hate being away from you
I've gotta go, even though I don't want to
I'd rather stay 
Than be away from you 
I can't wait to see your smiling face 
And cuddle up in front of the fireplace
I'd rather stay
Than be away from you 
 
Sometimes I find myself
Reaching for you
When talking on the phone
Is all we can do
But it won't be long, until I'm back to you
I'm counting the seconds
The minutes
The hours
The days 
Until we're face to face
'Cause I hate being away

Get that close to me again
'Cause last time I let you
Our life was one big argument

And I'm willing to bet you
That we'd be better off as friends
Can you accept just being friends?

You're telling me that we should sit down
And talk about us
But truthfully, I really don't agree
'Cause we don't have much to discuss

For some reason you think that we could work it out
I have serious doubts

Baby, I don't know if I can let you
Get that close to me again

And I'm willing to bet you

That would be the biggest lie I could ever tell
I'm just tryna save myself from the drama
'Cause we have gone through so much hell
And I don't wanna go back

I bet you we should just be friends and only friends

To you and your crazy love
It's back to this again
My heart keeps giving in

I hadn't heard from you in a while
Since I said it was over
So when you called me the other day
It was a total surprise

You said you still love
Miss me need to be with me
But the days are still passing by
In three months I'll be hearing that same ol' thing
That's how I know it's all lies

You said you would call the next day
How I waited and prayed
That you would
Hell, it's been five days since that
I should have known it 
Even your bond on your word ain't no good
If you love me
You'd work a real job
You wouldn't need all them cars

You wouldn't need all that ice on your arm
Anything to be with me
You would do it
But instead your choose to put me through it, oh

I so want to believe in you
But you keep making it so hard to
How much more can my heart take
Is hanging on to us a big mistake

But knew that I would feel better

Then you hit me on my cell
And said that we were going
Out when I get off

Just what I was hoping
You must have read my mind
Something that you often do

Again you saved the day
By knowing what to say
You're always coming through
The times I most need you

Like the other day
There was deposit
Put into my account
And I knew nothing about it

When I asked you you why you did it
You said that it was just because I love you

Again you saved the day
By knowing what to say
You're always coming through
The times I most need you

I'm so glad I finally
Met someone who cares for me
The way that you do
Again you saved the day
