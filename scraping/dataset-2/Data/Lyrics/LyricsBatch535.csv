Keaton Henson,"And It seems as though
I'm on my own
And time transcends, oh!

And it seems I speak
Like waters leak
And I'm losing friends, oh!

And there'll be coins on my eyes
There'll be coins on my eyes
To pay Charon
Before I let you near my son

And I don't feel well
Oh, couldn't you tell,
From the way I touch my face?

My thoughts are low
And I cannot grow
In this small space, oh!

But there'll be coins on my eyes
There'll be coins on my eyes
To pay Charon,
Before I let you near my son

And I ain't no,
And I ain't no,
And I ain't no Hercules
I ain't no Hercules",Charon,2010
Keaton Henson,"I am alone, so don't speak
I find war, and I find peace
I find no heat, no love in me

And I am low and unwell
This is love, this is hell
This sweet plague that follows me

And my body's weak
Feel my heart giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
And my body's weak
Feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
Something my soul needs

And I see a war on the screen,
And it is is cruel and unclean
But I still worry more about you

And I am rude and unkind
Have no thought, and have no time
Have no eyes, so no point of view

And my body's weak,
I feel my heart giving up on me,
I'm worried it might just be
My body's weak,
Feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
Something my soul needs
Something my soul needs
Something my soul needs

And I am more than this frame,
I feel hurt and I feel shame
I just wish you would feel the same

And I am more than these bones
I feel love, I feel alone
I just wish you would come home

My body's weak
I feel my heart giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
My body's weak,
Feel my lungs giving up on me
I'm worried it might just be
Something my soul needs
Something my soul needs
Something my soul needs

Is you, lying next to me.
And it's you, lying next to me.",Flesh and Bone,2010

Can't make your party

So this is where you wanted to be
And it's a goddamn shamed that you're not here with me

Keaton Henson,"And I know that there's friction
Between me and you,
I know that you're uncomfortable,
Believe me, I do.
I know that it's hard for you to tell me the truth.
But while we are doing so,
Sarah, I love you.

And though your skin's sheet white
And your arms carry scars.
Your hair isn't clean much,
Your lungs black with tar.
And god, you love to argue,
You can't play guitar.
But still, let me tell you
That I love who you are
Still let me tell you
That I love who you are.

Love, young love
I hope you are well
At least we now both
Have a story to tell
Young love, I feel
You know me better than most
In spite of real distance, we'll always be close,
In spite of real distance, we'll always be close.

Golden Brown was our soundtrack

Keaton Henson,"Miss you terribly already,
Miss the space between your eyelids,
Where I'd stare through awkward sentences
And avoid through awkward silence

Miss your teeth when they chatter,
When we smoked out in my garden
When we couldn't sleep for all the heat,
Soft talk began to harden.

Miss your small hands in the palm of mine
The fact they're good at making,
Miss your sitting up incessantly,
And the fact you're always waking in the night, night.

And I,
I hope for your life
You forget about mine
Forget about mine

Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder,
As we rolled in early morning,
Miss your arm dying beneath me,
As I lay there simply yawning

Please forget me, you were right dear,
I am cold and self-involved,
And though I'll miss you, recent lover
I am weak and therefore fold

Get distracted by my music,
Think of nothing else but art
I'll write my loneliness in poems,
If I can just think how to start

Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils,
Close my eyelids, hide my eyes,
I'll be idle in my ideals,
Think of nothing else but I.

I, and I

And I,
I hope for your life
You can forget about mine
Just forget about mine

You don't like to be touched,
Let alone kissed.

Does he know where your lips begin?

Do you know who you are?
Do you laugh, just to think

Just to tell me I have not been wrong
Is this all that you can give me back?
Come on, woman, you'll have to do less than that

And now I see that waking everyday
Always leads straight to feeling this way
And if you have no more to say than that

I sit and stare at you
You seem to look through me
I wonder what you see

I still have two stations yet
Counting the one that we just left
I wish I could stay with you
And ask you what you do

I figure you love to read
Don't look for the faults like me
You probably love the sun
But think you're the only one

And I wish I could wake at dawn
To see you without make up on
Wish I had the guts to say
You look the best today
You look the best today
You look the best today

I feel I know your smile
Like I saw it when I was a child
Though today you just frown and read
Your eyes flicker perfectly
Rush hour crush surrounds
Reminds me that we're still in town
I think of the time when I
Sat and watched a stranger cry

I wish I could wake at dawn
To see you without make up on
Wish I had the guts to say
You look the best today

The sweet magnolia trees

From the light of a distant star
I can see my future and I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar, oh yeah

And free me from this crime
Well, I have no shame and I have no blame

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Keb' Mo',"I was afraid to get out of the car
So I just sat there, I just sat there
How was I gonna tell them
That I'd lost my job
I gotta go in there
I'm going in there

So we gathered 'round the table
And I told them the news
But the looks of desperation
Nearly broke me in two

Son, I know you wanted
Them running shoes
They're gonna have to wait
They're gonna have to wait
And darlin' I know you wanted
That dress in the window
We're gonna get it
It just won't be now

Then my little girl looked up at me
With those big round eyes
And the words that she told me
Almost made me cry

(She said) we don't need it
We can do without it
We're gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're gonna stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you

My son said, Daddy
I got sixteen dollars
I want you to take it
I want you to take it
The next door neighbor
Asked me to rake the leaves
And I'm gonna do it
I'm sure gonna do it

'Cause I wanna help you out
Any way I can
It's about time
That I learned to be a man

My wife said, darlin'
We've got all this stuff
Just sittin' there
Just sittin' there
Like grandma's china
And her sterling silverware
It's just sitting there, gathering dust

We ain't used it yet
So let's put it out in the front yard
See what we can get

We're gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're gonna stick together

Days and weeks and months went by
The big boss called in the nick of time
I got my check and I brought it home
Yeah it's been tough but we've been blessed
We're gonna get them shoes
And that brand new dress (but you know)

We don't need it

Le sang est dans les boîtes et dans les bloques et puis attendu
Bang, bang, bang on t’arrache tes tendons
En arrivant t’es à tonton, ici l’ambiance est tendue
Vroum vroum vroum, démarre le fer et allez hop ici on nique ta mère
Tes frères tes sœurs et tout c'qui va avec
Zerma tu fais les ventes, suis pas ton pouls la route
Ta musique elle tourne en rond comme à l’époque du hula-hoop
T’es venu chez moi, y a des cadavres sur la route
On va venir chez toi t’monter en l’air tout là-haut
Y a des voyous d’chez moi qui t’allument pour pas un rond
Y a des voyous d’chez toi qui ont peur des grands d’chez moi
Bang, bang, bang, la rue c’est dangereux
Mais que veux-tu qu’j’te dise igo, la rue c’est dangereux
La rue c’est dangereux

Pour un oui pour non ici on kiffe ta grand-mère
Bang, bang, bang on kiffe ta grand-mère
Pour un oui pour non ici on kiffe ta grand-mère, ouais

Ici tu finis pendu
Les keufs te questionnent, j’ai rien vu j’ai rien entendu
Bang, bang, bang, on mange des fruits défendus
Et on devient fêlé, sauvages comme des félins
Ça fume la ganja et ça fait le ninja
Trente ans passés pourtant j’pense qu’il est tant d’se relever
Ça fume la ganja, mais reste là
Trente ans passés pourtant j’pense qu’il est tant d’se relever

Hey Jazzy, tu l'sais très bien que la prod ne t'appartient pas, hey
Et pour laisser une trace, j'ai pris des risques cash
En RSA ou RS4 demain j'arrête le taf
Pour que les blacks règnent, non pas pour que les chattes m'aiment
J'arrête l'alcool, le Poliakov, j'arrête le Jack Miel
J'pense à nos paradis, négro, j'pense à nos cœurs, à vif
À Kurt Cubain, qui se dit normal, demain j'arrête la vie
Demain j'arrête les flows magiques désormais j'me fais rare

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin' that's why the bad hoes jockin'

It's a party it's a party it's a party

Rollin' a lot I'm trying to get fucked up

It's a party it's a party it's a party
It's a party it's a party it's a party

I step in the club, rollin' on that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying be quiet
My bread startin' a riot, your girl getting excited
Hold on wanna try it, I'm like why not try it
My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it
Club going stupid, when I oh lets do it
Chu ain't gotta chew it, juking and she moving
Grove street villain nigga who you killin'?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jackson's to the ceiling that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm rollin'
Throwing up the mean bread
Now I'm bout to meet her in the club with a heater

A party ain't a party til I walk in it
Lime green flap match the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kinda tinted
Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinnin'
I'm rollin' like a mothafucka I'm a roll out in this motherfucker
I'ma roscoe dash it I'ma bout to show out in this mothafucka
My jewelry game on frost about to snow out in this mothafucka
Ay flocka get them burners lets pull out in this mothafucka
Ay mothafucka what the hell is you rockin' for run up on me and my squad
No that shouldn't be an option so
Somebody betta let you know I suggest that you let it go

Rollin on them leaves, you can do the lean
Blowing on that loud perp, pass that bobby brown back
The hood got my fucking back, the streets I'm not duckin' that
Please step the fuck back, grove street yes we are back
Hood plus I'm nigger rich, every ghetto feeling this
20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist,
100 on my neck iced out for my respect
20 fucking 10 I'ma blow the whole check
In the club flex, after party flex,
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket I'ma spend it all,
When a nigga die they gon' say shawty raw

Keco Brandão,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,
Keco Brandão,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,

Strangers on my back

Maybe I should give it up

Your the mate that fate had me created for

One that they could croon

And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

Gave birth to the blues!",Be Mine (Little Baby),1957

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

I met a trumpet playin' character and man alive
When he began to rip, he really played it from the hip
And when I asked about his name, they told me, that's The Lip
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

He's got a tone that's reminiscent of a boy named Bix
He plays so high that only dogs can hear him, just for kicks
And when I asked him does he read
He says, I'll tell you, hon'
I read a little bit but not enough to hurt me none

(No, man, she means Harry James)

(You mean Louis Prima)
I said The Lip
(Noo, Lip er ace)
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I never heard a trumpet player play a note so high
I had to coax a lot before The Lip would tell me why
Then he took out a little jar that's labelled high note grease
And he rubs a little every night on his mouthpiece
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

Listen here gal, are you kiddin' about all that high note grease?
No, man, I swear, he had ten in a big valise
Wha', you mean he goes to the drugstore
And gets them from the medicine shelf?
No, some cat's told me he makes it himself
(Yip yip yip yip)
Tell us the secret of The Lip

Well, you take a bucketful of steam
And a dozen rooster eggs
And you mix 'em up gently with a bushel full of goldfish legs
And ya hang 'em on a sky hook in the midnight sun
Mmm and then you fry them until they're done

Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song thru the trees
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That fine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

Don't I feel it in my soul
And don't I know I've reached my goal
Sing me to sleep

Why the thrill when you say ""Hello""

Why this trembling when you speak
Why this joy when you touch my cheek
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

That comes with each new love affair

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.

And not the words of one who kneels.

Keely Smith,"There's a fruit store on our street
It's run by a Greek.
And he keeps good things to eat
But you should hear him speak!
When you ask him anything, he never answers ""no"".
He just ""yes""es you to death, and as he takes your dough
He tells you
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
We've string beans, and onions
Cabbageses, and scallions,
And all sorts of fruit and say
We have an old fashioned to-mah-to
A Long Island po-tah-to
But yes, we have no bananas.
We have no bananas today.""

Business got so good for him that he wrote home today,
""Send me Pete and Nick and Jim; I need help right away.""
When he got them in the store, there was fun, you bet.
Someone asked for ""sparrow grass"" and then the whole quartet
All answered
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
Just try those coconuts
Those walnuts and doughnuts
There ain't many nuts like they.
We'll sell you two kinds of red herring,
Dark brown, and ball-bearing.
But yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today.""

Yes, we are very sorry to inform you
That we are entirely out of the fruit in question
The afore-mentioned vegetable
Bearing the cognomen ""Banana"".
We might induce you to accept a substitute less desirable,
But that is not the policy at this internationally famous green 
grocery.
I should say not. No no no no no no no.
But may we suggest that you sample our five o'clock tea
Which we feel certain will tempt your pallet?
However we regret that after a diligent search 
Of the premises
By our entire staff
We can positively affirm without fear of contradiction
That our raspberries are delicious; really delicious
Very delicious
But we have no bananas today.

Yes, we gotta no banana

We gotta no banana today.

No? well, just a oneofadozen?

Dainty Debbies will call you a dope

But the poet of them all
Who will start 'em simply ravin'
Is the poet people call
The Bard of Stratford on Avon

Brush up your Shakespeare
Start quoting him now
Brush up your Shakespeare
And the women you will wow

Just declaim a few lines from Othella
And they'll think you're a hell of a fella
If your blonde won't respond when you flatter 'er
Tell her what Tony told Cleopatterer

If she fights when her clothes you are mussing
What are clothes? Much ado about nussing
Brush up your Shakespeare
And they'll all kow-tow

Brush up your Shakespeare
Start quoting him now
Brush up your Shakespeare

Try a crack out of ""Troilus and Cressida""

No longer will I misjudge
On the account of my lust

Of what I've grown to know as love
I reminisce of days gone by
Your innocence gone

What you once were It troubles me
But now I see, why you must leave
Time again

Looks so good, speaks so good, I think I got a thing for a boy from the hood
'Cause I'd be lying if I said you was just something that I'm into

Bogota, she like finessing niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport 
And got seats on the court from the best of niggas

I never lost my El Chapo

If I'd stayed and weren’t heard, what would amount to me?
If I had looked and ain't found, would I have founded me?
I mean inside, would they loved me, never looked down on me?
They say, ""You know if you loved her
Well then you would have stayed
You could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn't trade""
Trade for nothing, I did though, I had to chase it
Face it, I wasn’t born to live a life basic
They say, ""you turned your back on us just to go and be an artist

I bet he don’t come back for us when he makes it

But if it gets you, then you’re weak

Like when she lost her job and everything, how broke we was
When she was sick and she needed some taking care of
A fifteen year old shouldered the weight
And when he was scared of

In that first grade class they came and got me
""Your mom's outside, say goodbye now to everybody""
U-Haul's waiting with all of our things
At least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way too young to comprehend what was happening
""Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?""
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused they try to explain but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Or for the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important
I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depressions a rotten curse
Hiding in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becoming more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her she was blue, her skin was cold, she wasn't breathing
Screamed, ""Melissa wake up"" couldn't fathom that she was leaving
Mom and bro was running down, I screamed ""somebody help""
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection
While in her life you made her happy, thank you for the blessing

When I loved you, I didn't love me
You were this dark cloud hanging above me
Got all my girls like, ""Lani where'd you go?
You've begun to slip away into where, nobody knows""

I brushed myself off, changed the weather
Like the Sun you are so warm, and for once I feel adored

I done made millions of dollars, but I'm still alone until I come home back to you
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house and laughed all on your avenue

Kei Kobayashi,"When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd

Keiko Lee,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2002
Keiko Lee,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2002
Keiko Lee,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002
Keiko Lee,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Keiko Lee,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,2002
Keiko Lee,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2004
