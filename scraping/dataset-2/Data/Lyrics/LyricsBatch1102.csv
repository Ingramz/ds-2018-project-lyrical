In the backseat of a car
I'm like a cellphone with no bars
Swing! motherfucker on par
We are, here for one reason
So keep the ratio even
And keep the radio beepin' (on and on)
Like simpsons season
Bleakin' on the bathroom floor
Got her wet like a thunderstorm
Sleep with me and not a whore (no!)
Daddy breaking down the back door
Ain't fuckin', then what the fuck you for?
Work it, where you get our source?
Twista, get on all fours
Off the lights, on the floor

Got game to get you girl
Sunside, onside, all of that
From b-town where the ballers at
Holla back if you my homie
If you're not, then get to know me
No snake but I might bite, girl
Half naked with a half white, girl (yeah)
Feeling like I have bites
Turn you on like a flashlight
Go man, oh hop on my bike
Like look ma, no hands
No plans but I'm spiderman
You mary jane, my fighter man
Vicodin, stop the beat
The sunrise look new to me

Can you see it?
What, where is it?
It's over there
Yeah it is
Over the horizon

The Cate Brothers,"I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
My and my woman was just getting' right
All systems on overload
The radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows - zero visibility
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

You can wine and dine a woman all night
With good intent
But there's something about a confrontation on a back road

The Cathedral Quartet,"Crowds have lined the narrow street
To see this man from Galilee
Just a carpenter some say, leading fools astray
Yet many kneel to give Him praise

And in His eyes, they glimpse the power
That sees the heart of all men
And He knows His Father's mind
He speaks His Father's words
For He comes in the name of the Lord

There is strength in the name of the Lord
There is power in the name of the Lord
There is hope in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

And when my strength is nearly gone
When there's nothing left to do but just depend on You
And the power of Your name

And as we call upon Your name
Your strength through weakness to show
We can know the masters plan extend the masters hand
When we come in the name of the Lord

Parading, always trading privileged words
That help you to win the crowd

Just stay home and kick around

Exercise my right to obey, 
Do it today 

Nevermore will you crawl around again
We'll sign your face
And tenderize your brain my friend 
So when you blunder out
Into the light
Too comfortable to ever turn us in
Never turn us in
Here comes Rosie! 

(Instrumental Break)




Don't test me this way
You might as well be right the first time
Here's my chance, okay
Just hold your cups in the morning
Breathe it all in and feel great
Never too late
Never too late
Oh, but not a drop to drink",Here Comes Rosie,1992
The Cavedogs,"They built a love grenade
Are all grenades the same?
I think they are
I think this is
They built it to blow us away 

They blew the wind to change
The price was right in range
They're selling to you
They're selling to me
They're crowding the road to the Cape 

[Chorus:]

You're a little bit louder than you ought to be
You're a little bit louder than we
But I can't help it
I bought into the love grenade
The love grenade 

We'll be paying for your when you're old
So save it like you're told
Remember back then
Way back when
We'll throw you a love grenade 

We'll blow the wind to change
When the price is right in range
We'll be selling to you
Like you're selling to me
We'll crowd the road to the Cape 

Into the love grenade

The Cavedogs,"Wind of sorrow, song of pain 
Make tomorrow an easy thing
She's up on a hillside flogging the dead
Says I'm not gonna go till it blackens my head 
Bring on sorrow, 
Have to borrow 

Banish color and the sane
Ignore the Sabbath and pray for rain
She's up in the evening playing a game
She don't want to know that it's nicely arranged 
Bring on sorrow, 
I will follow 

Draw the curtains, prone on the floor 
Like to kill with a kiss
""Quadrophenia"" blasts down the walls 
Of you and all other kids 
So don't bring up sorrow to me
Don't dream up sorrow to see 


Crown of sorrow, boots of pain 
By tomorrow a fashion thing
I'm up on my highhorse calling her names
I'm not one of you, cause I don't wear your pain 
She dreams up sorrow, 
Still I follow 

(Instrumental Break)




She dreams up sorrow,
A dream she swallows 


Cool coffee lie on the floor
Ashes floating are grim 
Gothic posters, heighten remorse
Asleep she just dreams of him 
So don't bring up sorrow to me 
Don't play with what you can't see
Don't dream of someone, not me 
Or bring back someone to see
Don't leave it sorrow or me
Don't play with what you can't see
Bring out something in me
Don't bring up sorrow to see",Sorrow (Boots of Pain),1992
The Cavedogs,"A whispered you 
Seeming veiled from views intent 
And hopeless dreams that lent 
These features that aspire 
Forever and forever 
To be what you are 
In monuments of parts and lines 
Whose seams are tired 
As if they might 
Show what's inside and see 
What is awaiting me 
It could shake me from my seat 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
But you're quietly turning a page 
You're put away

A listless smile 
Like a mistress filing blame 
It wilts back where it came 
Its impact never seen 
Never into never 
Like a broken piece 
That's a token least acclaimed 
But it's all that's saved 
And it's held on tight 
For what it might have seen 
You never came to me 
Just what you'd thought I'd need 
To lead me on 
To lead me on 
But like I was never playing along 
You had gone 
From me.

Voices surrounding me 
With sterile and costly sounds 

Voices surrounding me 
With sterile and costly sounds 

Voices surrounding me 

I don't know where you took me 
But I didn't want to leave 

What you are 
In monuments of parts and lines 
Whose seams are tired 
As if it might 
Show what's inside and see 
What is awaiting me 
It could shake me from my seat 
It's not too late 
It's not too late

And hug a way and chalk a mark

And a chalkin' and a huggin' a way
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand

My bones don't ache and my joints creak
But I, I grow absolutely limp

Mink in a pen. So I left her now I'm happy as a fella could be
Huggin' and chalkin' in once a gain 'round my Rosie

We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited.
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heaven's generosity.
Peeping round the door
To see what parcels are for free
In curiosity.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is.
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends
He sits so silently
And unaware of everything.
Playing poxy pinball,
Picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything.
I believe in love
But how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened.
Only if he's cured
Will his spirits future level ever heighten.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is.

Ducked your head under

And catch cold so you died?

And threw it on the fire

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be.""

Love will find a way',
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday

To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said, ""Here we go!""

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage

But soon the atmosphere was cooler
As Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
And touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage

[Chorus]

Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye, she had to try
But couldn't see through their lights
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face, oh

Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said
""Don't say I didn't warn you.""
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California

Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile

The Chambers Brothers,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain,1968
The Chambers Brothers,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Dragged into this world and thrown away
She never wanted you
Better things to do

You won't remember
Drawn to the door
Whizzing through the week
Dancing round the fire with the rest of the freaks

Oh, no, no, things are different now
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn him inside out

His second mother holds him to her breast
She sees her children come and go
Ripping the heart from her
All of them part of her

And some will remember
Time heals all wounds they say
She can't let them
Take her boy away

This son, oh, she would die without
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn her inside out

When she was young
The world was a different place
After all

And his heart is in his home
There helplessly waiting for someone
To smash his world to pieces
Ignorant and cruel, social student fools

Pull him to the right, pull him to the left
Pull him by the arms, pull him by the legs
Let go

Oh, things are different now
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn them inside out

When you were young, they wore a different face
When she was young, the world was a different place
When you were young, they wore a different smile

Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

The Champs,"I was at the bar with my drinkin team
It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave Y'all
When in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval
We were fallin, stumblin, crawlin
Her come da police, Captain Tom Collins
And the rapper said freeze
He said ""hands in the air and hand over your keys""
Now we did, and that was kinda simple
Now here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple
I asked my friend 'bout Marguarita,
He said Shirley was a virgin an I wouldn't wanna meet her
So I talked to Marguarita, cause yoh, she was flyer
I took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver
Now Im not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all
 
Tequila
Te-te-te, Tequila
Tequila
 
Here we go again and I'm not fussin'
See I'm a French Mexican but I can get with White Russians
At the bar with a drink in my hand
In walked Jose Cuervo what was margaritas man
I talked to the wise man cause, yoh he's distinguished
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old English
He said ""you'd better think fast
Cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glass""
He gave me some advice and it went like this
""Catch the night train and head up to 'cisco""
I didn't wanna stick around
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'
Was sippin' Ice Teas on Long Island
I blacked out and the party came to a halt
Cause I was drinking the Tequila with the lemon assault Y'all
 
Tequila
Te-te-te, Tequila
Tequila
 
I woke up in the morning and felt like a Zombie
The Tequila Gold Label had bombed me
You see I woke up late and wasn't feelin' so great
And Mike said there's a Bicardi party startin' at eight
Yo we walked in the party and started playin our games
We played tops, fuzzy quarters, with Bartles and James
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill
Because the Mickey Brothers took her up to strawberry hill
They took her a thousand mink and she could barely think
Cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental
There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental
A groupie is a girl that jocks
She wore the def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the Rocks
We had a fake marriage, now here's to honeymoon
Ya zone vagabond and the Blue Lagoon
Now everybody take a word from the wise
A girly and a bottle, Tequila Sunrise

For another day with your touch

Scotty gotta beam me up to the mother ship
I'm runnin’ undercover but I'm one of them runnin’ it
And I'm wonderin’ if this is not just another fake slumber from which I will arise
I am a problem, a threat and a virus in the eyes of your government, eyes of your god
You could say what you really want
No
You could say but you really won't know
You could say what you really want
But you really won't
Cuz you really don't know

You had me going
Without a warning
You turned into someone else
Maybe I was blind
Couldn’t see all the signs
But now I see so damn clear

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Who live in my home town
Because those dear hearts and gentle people
Will never ever let you down

That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown

Who live and love in my home town

There's a place I'd like to go
And it's back in Idaho
Where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello
It's a pleasure and a treat
To meander down the street
That's why I want the whole wide world to know

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

I just can't rest 'til I find
That raven black stallion who wears no man's brand
With a wild restless spirit like mine

Of the blanca Sierra Madre

They had their chance one by one
But each met his fate when those flashin' black hooves
Brought death 'neath the Mexican sun

Still I can't leave, I must find him
You fool of a horse can't you see
I may be half man, but the other half's devil
And you're just exactly like me

They call him Caballo Diablo

Hush now, be still
Don't make a sound and stay close to the ground
'Cause he's waitin' just over that hill

Downwind behind him move quickly
Do it fast now, he's startin' to stir
Grab a hand full of mane and up onto his back
And start breaking him down with my spurs

But try as he will, he can't shake me
As over the preface we go
To spill the lifes blood of a horse and a man
On the rocky Sierra below

Flowing up where folks are free

Send a letter in the mail 
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas 
And they won't let me outta this jail 

And if she asks you how I'm fairing 
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind 
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind 

Now Johnny Lee Walker was a card mechanic 
Had a hand for trouble and a eye for cash 
Luckiest man in Dallas County 
He had a gold watch chain and a black mustache 

And he loved his whiskey and he loved his women 
Drove a big long Cadillac limosine 
Kept a big fine fancy townhouse in Dallas 
And a hotel suite in New Orleans 

Carried a switchblade knife in his left hip pocket 
And a 44 hog leg up under his coat 
Cut you down in a New York minute 
If he catch you cheating that was all she wrote 

So call up Trudy on the telephone 
Send her a letter in the mail 
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas 
And they won't let me outta this jail

If she asks you how I'm fairing 
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind 
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker 
And the girl I left behind 

I just got to town last Friday evening 
Sure as hell didn't mean to stay 
I was on my way back to Louisiana 
Had a powerful thirst and six months pay 

I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on D-ville 
I was flying high and feeling mean 
Poured down a bottle and a half of red eye 
I dropped 35 dollars in the slot machine 

And the boys in the back was dealing 7 card 
I set down and won me a 110 
I was raking in chips like Grant took Richmond 
Till big Johnny Lee come a strolling in 

He ripped off the bar like a 707 
Pretty soon he done won all of my bread 
I accused him of cheating he reached for a pistol 
I grabbed a chair and went upside of his head 

Then I took off a running like a motorcycle 
Heard the bullets whining and sirens wail 
But it took half the cops in Dallas County 
Just to put one coon *** boy in jail 

So call up Trudy on the telephone 
Send her a letter in the mail 
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas 
And they won't let me outta this jail 

And if she asks you how I'm fairing 
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind

The Charlie Daniels Band,"When I was a young man in Sweetwater, Texas
Just one thing stayed on my mind
To ride a white horse, over Durango Mountain
And leave Sweetwater, Texas behind

But I turned 21, in Sweetwater, Texas
But just one thing made me stay there
I wanted to leave but I was in love with
The girl with the chestnut brown hair

Then came a time, when she said she'd be mine
And go any place, any time
So we rode a gray dog, over Durango Mountain
And left Sweetwater Texas behind

It was thunderin' and lightnin' when we left Nolan County
The bus rolled along through the night
And Old 36, was the magic black [Incomprehensible]
Leading towards the stadium lights

Well we pulled into Houston at ten in the morning
Our hopes were a high as the sky
But hope turned to weeks, then to years, then forever
I never knew how fast time goes by

Cowboys in cars and country girls in bars
Somehow, it just don't seem fair,
And I wanted to die 'cause I knew I was losing,
The girl with the chestnut brown hair

So many times I've said, I'd rather be dead,
Than take it down and go back, and unclear my head
But if the good Lord sees his way to let me live one more day
I'm so tired of being alone

Gonna ride a white horse over Durango Mountain
And make Sweetwater, Texas my home

And figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money and a whole lot of show
And with Hank Junior blaring on the radio
We got a tank full of gas and we was on our way

We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barrelling' down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light was on our tail
He said, ""You were doin' 60 in a 45
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again, I'm gonna slap you in the county jail""

We said, ""Thank you sir, you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice""
And we were Southbound and down with the wind blowing in our faces
We kept on rolling and pretty soon
The radio was cooking out a haggard tune
And we were pulling into Houston and checking out all the places

I was feeling dry and I said, ""I think
We ought to stop and get ourselves a drink""
Old Jim said, ""Yeah 'cause we got time to kill""
We kept on rolling and I seen this spot
We pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called, 'The Cloud Nine Bar and Grill'

We walked through the door and the place was jammed
The lights were low, they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired feller singing about suicide
I said, ""Jim, this ain't our kind of place
He said, ""Well, let's just have one round anyway""
So against my better judgment we walked on inside

Went up to the bar and we sat down
This feller walked up and said, ""I'll buy this round""
And he sat down on the barstool next to Jim
He looked like a girl but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him

I said, ""Jim, this ain't our kind of bar
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
'Cause there's gonna be trouble, ain't no sense in taking a chance""
We was getting up, getting ready to leave
When somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve
And this good looking girl, she was asking my buddy to dance

I said, ""Jim, don't do it, there's something missing
There's fellers dancing and fellers kissing
There's a feller in high heeled shoes wearing panty hose""
He said, ""Partner, I just can't turn this down
You just go over there and have one more round
I'll dance with the lady and we'll get on down the road""

So he walked away and left me alone
But this funny looking feller kept coming on
And he was making me mad with some of the things he said
Then he put his hand on my knee
I said, ""If you don't get your paw off me
I'm gonna locate your nose around the other side of your head""

He said, ""I love it when you get that fire in your eye
I said, ""Well, partner try this on for size""
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me, I said, ""This is the end""
But where I come from, we don't give up without a fight

They were screaming and yelling and scratching and clawing
I was punching and hitting and kicking and pawing
I was holding my own, 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come running up out of the blue
And that gal he was with, come running up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe

I grabbed her by the hair it came off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
And old Jim just got sick right there on the floor
He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick, made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fighting our way to the door

Man, we lit out of there in that Chevrolet
I put in on the floor and it stayed that way
We was going' down the highway doing about a hundred and ten
We were headed for home and we was getting nearer
Then a red light came on the rear view mirror
And that same blame cop was pulling us over again

Now I'm sitting' here in this county jail
I had to call my Daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson that I never will forget again

Toolin' along in my Chevrolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio

Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go

Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight
So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn

Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one

There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me
And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone

I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy t'day
And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so

He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother
Tellin' the durn fool 
I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go

I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car
With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor

Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd jus wait outside
So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door

Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dude come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth

An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said you tip your hat to this lady son
An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath

Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me

Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick
So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green-teeth right in the knee

He let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man

Well you may not know it but this man's a spy
He's an undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan

He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me
And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went

I said would you beleive this man has gone as far
As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGoveren for president

Well he's a friend of them long-haired hippie type pinko fags
I betcha he's even got a Commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage

He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage

They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim
You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life

I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife

Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck

And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks
And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up

Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot

An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run
But somehow I couldn't resist the fun
Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot

Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air

Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there

When I hit the road I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pickup truck
And I'm full of American pride
I keep a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in mindin'
No one's business but my own

I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame ole John Wayne

Now they're tryin' to take my guns away
And that would be just fine
If you take 'em away from the criminals first
I'll gladly give ya mine
And I don't mind payin' taxes
But it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes
To make some politician rich

What most people call a redneck
Ain't nothin' but a workin' man
And he makes his livin' 
By the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands
Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you

That make me mad down to the core.

I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder'n hell and I ain't gonna take it no more.

We tell our kids to just say no
Then some panty waist judge lets a drug dealer go
Slaps him on the wrist and then he turns him back out on the town.

Now if I had my way with people sellin' dope
I'd take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down

People done gone and put their Bible's away
They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The good book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it I'm a Simple Man.

Now I'm the kinda man that'd not harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin in my house
I've got twelve gauge shotgun waiting on the other side

So don't go pushing me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
So if you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by

As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the raping and the killing and the child abuse
And I've got a way to put an end to all that mess

Just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

They're living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land

Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too

'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

And he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done.""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run

Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been.""

The Charlie Daniels Band,"Well, down in Mississippi, there's a little bitty town
And there ain't much happens 'till the sun goes down
Then all the people come from miles around
To hear a little four-piece band
There's a dog house bass and a kid on the drums
And a guitar picker just as hot as they come
Up steps a man with a bow on his thumb and a fiddle in his hand
He tunes up the fiddle and he rosins up the bow
And he plays an old tune called ""Cotton Eyed Joe""
And they dance all night on a hard wood floor to the redneck fiddlin' man

CHORUS:
Good times go by easy
Good times fly away

One night some boys from town came by
With a bellyfull of liquor and the devil in their eye
And they said, ""Old man, you're way out'a style
You don't play Rock N' Roll""
Well, he picked up his fiddle with style and ease
And he played a little rock just as pretty as you please
Then he bent down, turned around, knocked them to their knees
When he played a little mountain soul
Then, he tightened up his bow and he made another pass
And he played ""Sally Good'N"" kinda' rowdy and fast
Then he played a little blues and he played a little jazz
Just to show them he could do it all

The Charlie Daniels Band,"I was takin' a trip out to LA,
Toolin' along in my Chevrolet
Tokin' on a number and diggin' on the radio

Jes' as I cross the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go

Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a fillin' station in sight
So I jes' limped down the shoulder on the rim

I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
A kind of a redneck lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn

Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one

There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place 'cept for him an' me
And he just looked disgusted an' pointed toward the telephone

I called up the station down the road a ways
And he said he wasn't very busy t'day
And he could have somebody there in jest 'bout ten minutes or so

He said now you jes' stay right where yer at and I didn't bother
Tellin' the durn fool 
I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go

I jes ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in an' said who owns this car
With the peace sign the mag wheels and four on the floor

Well he looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd jus wait outside
So I layed a dollar on the bar and headed for the door

Jes' when I thought I'd get outta there with my skin
These five big dude come strollin' in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth

An' I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said you tip your hat to this lady son
An' when I did all that hair fell out from underneath

Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
'Specially when there was three of them and only one of me

Well they all started laughin' and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I'd better think of somethin' pretty quick
So I jes' reached out an' kicked ol' green-teeth right in the knee

He let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said watch him folks 'cause he's a thouroughly dangerous man

Well you may not know it but this man's a spy
He's an undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan

He was still bent over holdin' on to his knee
But everyone else was lookin' and listenin' to me
And I layed it on thicker and heavier as I went

I said would you beleive this man has gone as far
As tearin' Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGoveren for president

Well he's a friend of them long-haired hippie type pinko fags
I betcha he's even got a Commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage

He's a snake in the grass I tell ya guys
He may look dumb but that's jus a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage

They all started lookin' real suspicious at him
And he jumped up an' said jes' wait a minute Jim
You know he's lyin' I've been livin' here all of my life

I'm a faithfull follower of Brother John Burch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife

Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy movin' and hopin' I didn't run outta luck

And when I hit the ground I was makin' tracks
And they were jes' takin' my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty an' jumped in an' fired that mother up

Mario Andretti woulda sure been proud
Of the way I was movin' when I passed that crowd
Comin' out the door and headin' toward me in a trot

An' I guess I shoulda gone ahead an' run
But somehow I couldn't resist the fun
Of chasin' them jes' once around the parkin' lot

Well they're headin' for their car but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
Well I was slingin' gravel and puttin' a ton of dust in the air

Well I had them all out there steppin' an' a fetchin'
Like their heads were on fire and their asses was catchin'
But I figured I oughta go ahead an split before the cops got there

When I hit the road I was really wheelin'
Had gravel flyin' and rubber squeelin'
An' I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas

I think I'm gonna re-route my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to LA via Omaha!

The Charlie Daniels Band,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I am found

And how precious did that Grace appear

Who but Thee my burden shares?
None but Thee, oh Lord, none but Thee.

The mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies

The Charlie Daniels Band,"On a clear night, many many years ago 
Two weary strangers moving slow 
Were looking for a place to stay 
But there was no place 
Though they traveled many miles 
So Mary being great with Child 
Lay down on the sweet smelling hay. 
Then a bright light fell from heaven 
As a special star shone bright 
And three wise men from a foreign land 
Came to worship him that night 
And in the clear night you could hear the angels sing 
Praises to the newborn King 
Jesus is the light of the world. 

And the angels heralding the Holy Birth 
Were singing Peace to men on Earth 
Unto you is born a Son 
And the shepherds 
Though they had their flocks to tend 
Journeyed unto Bethlehem 
To behold the Holy One 

And then the Boy grew up to be a Man 
Come to set the captives free 
Come to heal the sick and raise the dead 
And to cause the blind to see 
And the best part is even though 
He's gone away 
He'll be coming back someday 
Jesus is the Light of the world.

You would even say it glows

They got a band seven nights a week
And if you don't show up before the sun goes down
You ain't gonna find a seat

They like their music, country
And they like their country loud

And the band starts pickin' hot
They start dancin' on the tables, dancin' on the ceilin'
Dancin' in the parking lot

You start feelin' it flow from your head to your toe
You sure are glad you've come

Down to Little Joe and Big Bill's

When it comes to southern cookin'
They know what it's all about
They got some barbecue ribs and red beans and rice
Make your tongue snap your eyeballs out

And you don't wanna 'cause no trouble
Buddy 'less you're willin' to die
'Cause Big Bill will stomp a mud hole in you
And Little Joe will walk you dry

Well, there's a cowboy's dream in tight blue jeans
Swingin' through the swingin' doors
And there's a long tall cutie, scootin' booty
Out there on the floor

Well, I guess it's time to get in line
'Cause the house is startin' to hum

When it's just about time to close

And start rockin' San Antonia Rose

And in a fancy car with a private bar and a personal valet
There was a bunch of cold eyed men sittin' at a poker table
Bettin' hot stakes all around

Ole Louisiana Lou had a knife in his shoe was dealin?
A hand of cards and ole Stagger Lee Crocket had a gun in his pocket
Was sweatin' bettin' hard and over in the corner this Mexican guy

Kept getting hot till every cent everybody had was lying out in the pot
And then the stranger threw down a royal flush, somebody said ""Hey man, that's enough friend I think you've been cheatin'""

And then the stranger picked the money up and said, ""Boys I better run?

In a long pine box if you don't leave that money alone""

I was born in a house of New Orleans traveling up the river on the North bound paddle leaders
I was nurtured in the Mississippi delta when seeds of the blues sprang forth in the rich black soil
I was there when Elvis learned to sing, when BB got his first guitar
I'm black and white and smooth and rough and hard and soft
I'm the roots of American music
And I'm always there just the local service
And when the chaff of trend and bad is swept aside
I'm exposed again
Strong, pulsating and very much alive
The winds of change may blow the tree away
But the roots remain, then, now and until the end","Then, Now and Until the End",2002

Here you are again, and here I go
Down the same old street I already know
That same sweet voice and those same old lies
I'm drawn into the world behind your eyes.

CHORUS
And I try to run away
But I know it's only a try
‘Cause everything I could ever want
Is there behind your eyes,
Behind your eyes.

Seeing you again and it all comes down
Thinking how it was the first time around
And when I feel that feeling again
I have no chance, I must give in 
",Behind Your Eyes,2004
The Charlie Daniels Band,"On a cold concrete sidewalk, on the corner of fifth and main
Sits an old black blind man, and no one knows his name
He plays the same old guitar, he plays the same old tune
And when the people pass him by, some are heard to say
“Play, let the blind man play”

He was a cotton picker down in Alabam'
Daddy never amounted to much died by his own hand
He lost his sight one terrible night by the hand of the Ku Klux Klan
Burned his eyes with a branding iron some are heard to say;

Play, let the blind man play
Maybe you'll be around another day
Dreamin' about those little things you know you'll never see
So play, let the blind man play, let the blind man play!

The years were kind while the man was blind, but he knew his time was due
And no one cried when the blind man died, with the name that no one knew
They made his coffin outta knotty pine, with a wreath of laurel too
His epitaph was short and sweet, and all it said was play

Play let the blind man play
Maybe you'll be around another day
Dreamin' about those little things you know you'll never see
So play, let the blind man play, let the blind man play
Maybe you'll be around another day
Dreamin' about those little things you know you'll never see
So play, let the blind man play, let the blind man play

Play that guitar blind man!",Blind Man,2004
The Charlie Daniels Band,"Blue star, over my shoulder;
Blue star, can't you see;
Blue star, it's a little colder;
She's gone away from me.

CHORUS
And I wish I'd never seen her, with the sunlight in her eyes,
And I wish I'd never learned the games she played.
And I wish I'd never listened when she told me all the lies,
And I wish I'd never seen her walk away.

She was everything I wanted;
She was sweet mystery.
Blue star, now the nights are haunted;
She's gone away from me.

Dark eyes, glowin' like two diamonds filled with fire;
Dark hair, blowin' in the wind of hot desire;
Red lips, pullin' me down ",Blue Star,2004
The Charlie Daniels Band,"He wears a zoot suit with a reet pleat,
Drives a '36 Cord with a rumble seat.
He's a jitterbug; scare the letters off a highway sign.
He drinks beer and eats bennies
And chases it down with Thunderbird wine.
Carries brass knuckles and a .44,
Runs a loan shark business and a mary jane store.
He's a jitterbug; keeps movin', don't sit still;
If the law don't get him, some gun-totin' irate husband will.

One day in September he stepped out of his Cord,
Into the street to face a bullet-spittin' Ford.
Now he's “Jitterbug,” just a name in the news.
He finally paid the price;
He finally paid his dues.

You've been on my mind,
Like a mist in the morning,
From some dream I've left behind.

Mississippi,
I've been kinda down,
‘Cause it's been such a long time
Since I've seen old Jackson town.

I could be on the other side of the world,
But in my memory, all I can see
Is Spanish moss hangin' from a live oak tree.

Mississippi,
Save a place for me;
I'll be comin' home again [comin' home again],

The Charlie Daniels Band,"Well, I was born in Carolina, way back in the swamp
I was a happy country boy 'til television came along
It showed them far away places and it sho' was a bitch
'Cause every time I'd quit my traveling, well, my feet would start to itch

So I borrowed my daddy's suitcase and picked up my guitar
I walked up the highway and I flagged down a car
I hitchhiked out to Kansas City just as far as I could
My life was all before me and that highway sure looked good

Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I'm movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'm gone, I'm packin' my load a little further down the road

I moved on down to Dallas soon as I got the chance
I was playin' funky music for them city folks to dance
And I had money in my pocket, I had fun in my bed
But I've been here a year now and it's gettin' to my head

'Cause I've been rocked into ruin, I've been discoed to death
I've been funk rocked and punk rocked 'til I can't catch my breath
I've been ragged 'til I'm ragged, I've been new waved 'til I'm blind
But I've got a solution for my funky state of mind

Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I've movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'll be gone, no more blues just as long as I can move

Gimme that highway, better go my way
Crank up the big wheels, let 'em roll on
I've movin' like a fast train, gimme that passing lane
And I'm gone, I'm packin' my load a little further down the road",Passing Lane,2004
The Charlie Daniels Band,"He was nobly born
Had a spanish bull's horn
And not one scar on his hansom face

He stood like a prince
And he had ever since
He had grandly walked into the place

Though the girls of Madrid
Tonight were forbid
For tomorrow he must fight once more

Before he left the bar
He would dance with them all
Cause he was El Toreador

The day of the feast
Was just a lie in the east
When he left Maria's warm bed

Her dark eyes said more
But he walked through the door
Shaking cobwebs of dreams from his head

And later that day
As he knelt to pray
He said God grant me this nothing more

If it is the way
And I must die today
Let me die like a Toreador

The pageant he chose
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, round and round
On and on, all alone
 
The Plaza del Toros
Shook from the roar
As the band played the Toreador's theme

Alarmed by the sound
The bull paws the ground
As the Toreador enters the ring

Up and down, 
Round and round
On and on, all alone

The shouts of ole
In the heat of the day
Rushed the hot blood to his Spanish heart

And the crowd held their breath
As he flirted with death
And the bull fighter's sword found it's mark

And trying to hide
The wound in his side
He walked from the ring standing tall

And a crowd gathered round
As he fell to the ground
A priest held his hand
Where he lay in the sand
And he was heard to say
A brave bull died today
But he died like a Toreador",El Toreador,2004
The Charlie Daniels Band,"People say I'm no good and crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money but I damn sure got it made

'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone

Preacher man talking on T.V.
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And I know that it's true
But sometimes I think that preacherman
Would like to do a little walking too

But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I cant get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone

A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants a vote

But I will take another toke

But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'

The Charlie Daniels Band,"There's a place not too far away from here
Out with the cows and the Lone Star beer
Where the livin' and lovin' is quite all right with me
Well they call it Texas and it's a mighty fine place to be

Runs from Texarkana to El Paso
And Oklahoma down to old Mexico
And there's Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antone
People in Texas sure do make you feel at home

They just want everybody to leave them alone
While they drink their whiskey and roll their own
And they like their music with a little bit of southern sound
They kick up their heels every evening when the sun goes down

And you can call them country and they don't care
And if you don't like the way they wear their hair
You can take your like and shove 'em on up the line
People in Texas don't care if the sun don't shine",Texas [DVD],2004

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
Said, ""Virgil, quick come see'
There goes Robert E Lee""

And I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if my money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Like my father before me I'm a workin' man
And like my brother above me who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave

And I swear by the mud
Below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up

The Charlie Daniels Band,"Stroker Ace was born to race he had a mean streak two feet wide
A son of a gun with a taste for fun and more than his share of pride
Take a dirt road curve with a devils nerve make a car dance across the mud
Haulin? shine was his regular line till the track got in his blood

Was a real hot shot and he bragged a lot, but man that fool could drive
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel
And the girls with bedroom eyes
And in a race of time or a bar room fight, Ol? Stroker stole the show
A back stretch blazer, a real hell raiser and a racetrack Romeo

Mama lock your daughters up that vile bunch is back in town
And them little girls get frisky when they hear that race car sound
They're bringing out the yellow flag, somebody?s brakes have failed
There's an alsike on the inside and a wreck along the rail
You'd better stand on it Stroker 'cause a bandit?s on your tail

It?s a dynamite joy for a country boy when he hears them engines moan
But you've gotta hang tough when it gets real rough
When you're out there on your own 'cause they'll push you down
They'll knock you down, they'll shove you up against the wall
And you always know when the engine blows that a man can't win ?em all

You can push that car just a little too far any Sunday afternoon
And if you'd break your neck in some damn fool wreck
They'd forget about you soon
But Ol? Stroker Ace was born to race and it?s worth all the trying
Just the dirt champagne in the victory lane and to hear that concrete whine

Stroker get your dander up this ain't no time to laugh
You've got to make the lap up if you're gonna take that checkered flag
Number 10 is closin? in to even up the score
It?s time to wave bye bye and put the pedal on the floor
You'd better stand on it Stroker 'cause your blowin? off their doors

Blow their doors off Stroker
Stand on it, son
Ah, you good lookin? devil you

Gettin' in the way

Daddy, why are you so tall?
Daddy, why am I so small?
Daddy, who makes snowflakes fall?
Could it be the Lord?

Chasing puppies, climbin' trees
Bumping heads and skinnin' knees
It's not very hard to see
That kids are God's reward

Little folks get down and out
The girls will cry and boys will pout
Before you know what it's about
They're smiling once again

Colored kites on summer breeze
Jingle Bells and Christmas trees
Too soon they're only memories
Do you remember when?

Daddy, what makes eagles fly?
What makes clouds float in the sky?
And Daddy, if I really try
Will I grow up someday?

But little folks slip through our hands
Like so many grains of sand
You'd best enjoy them while you can
So soon they fly away...",Little Folks,2013

The Charlie Daniels Band,"If you ever go back into Wooly Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucias Clay gets up and it walks around.

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain.

The old man lived in the Wooly Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money.
He'd stuff it all down in Mason jars and bury it all around
But on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground.
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it.
Old Lucias Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it.

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain.

The Crayton boys were white trash they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak.
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooly Swamp later
We'll get old Lucias' money and we'll feed him to the alligators.
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand.
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
Till the black water sucked him down.
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran.
But they hadn't gone nowheres when they realized
They were running in quicksand.
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder.

Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet.
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three yound men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh.

Repeat (V-1)

And in weakness did let your love down
I have prayed that with time and compassion

And you keep saying you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

Now this home we have built is still standing
Its foundation is on solid ground
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

To either quit or follow through.
Just lose faith, or trust your heart,
To somehow lead you through the dark.
Without the only one,
Who's dreaming, who needs help to carry on.
We might get lonely, but we're not alone.

Cause we are sisters, we stand together.
We make up one big family,
Though we don't look the same.
Our spots are different, different colors.
We make each other stronger,
That ain't never gonna change
We're cheetah girls, Cheetah sisters.

Gotta walk, gotta tune.
Got the brains, got the power,
And we speak the truth.
We run everything all around the world,
So you best respect the Cheetah Girls.
We've been singing from our birth,
Working hard for what we deserve.
Trying not, to break the rules,
Cause momma didn't raise no fools.

If it seems we're only dreaming,
And we need help to carry on.
It's good to know we're not alone.

Cause we are sisters, we stand together.
We make up one big family,
Though we don't look the same.
Our spots are different, different colors.

Happy Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Send all my love away

Last Christmas
Baby
Oh oh oh oh 
Broke my heart
You broke my heart

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
Oh my I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A friend to discover with a fire in her heart
A girl under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll send it to someone special

When the snow comes to cover the ground,
It's the time for play,
It's a whipped cream day,
I wait for it all year round.
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
In the arms of the evergreen trees,
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
It's shining so your nose won't freeze.
The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,
The world is your snowball just for a song,
Get out and roll it along.

It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
Take a walk with your favorite girl,
It's a sugar date,
What if spring is late,
In winter, it's a marshmallow world.

Just got out of bed
Saw an amazing sight
Was it all just in my head?

Santa Clause was dancin'
He was dancing down
Presents filled my Living Room
There were reindeer flyin' 'round

Candy Canes and Chocolate Rainbows
Oh, this

[Chorus]
This ain't no ordinary holiday
When you're havin' a party
With Santa in the house
This ain't no ordinary holiday
When you're sittin' by the fire
And there's a snow man chillin' out

Over in the kitchen
Cookies on a plate
Santa ate them one by one
Till he got a tummy ache

Rudolph and his reindeer
Rockin' down the tree
Santa turned the music up
Sayin' ""come on dance with me""

Jingle Bells and Snow faced Fraila
Oh, this

[Chorus]

It's a holiday
No ordinary Christmas

When the song was over
Santa waved goodbye
In a moment he was gone
And he flew into the sky

Now I know that Santa
Really is no myth
Never be another day
Like the Santa 25th

My momma used to tuck me into bed
And she'd read me a story

It always was about
A princess in distress
And how a guy would save her
And end up with the glory

I'd lie in bed and think about
The person that I wanted to be
Then one day I realized the
Fairy tale life, wasn't for me

I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark ol' dusty cellar
Waitin' for somebody to come
And set me free

I don't wanna be someone waiting
For a handsome prince to come
And save me all I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side
Don't wanna be, no, no, no, no
Oh yes, I'd rather rescue myself

I can save my own
(I can save)
Dragons, I can dream my own dreams
(My own dreams)
My knight in shining armor is me
So I'm gonna set me free

Sittin' in a dark ol' dusty cellar
Waitin' for somebody to come
And set me free

The Cheetah Girls,"When I was just a little girl my mama used to tuck me into bed and she'd read me a story
It always was about a princess in distress and how a guy would save her and end up with her glory 
I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be 
Then one day I realized that fairy tale life wasn't for me 

[Chorus]
I don't want to be like Cinderella 
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar 
Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free 
I don't want to be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side 

Don't want to be no no no one else
I'd rather rescue myself 

Someday I'm gonna find someone that wants me for my soul heart and mind 
Whose not afraid to show that he loves me 
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am Don't need nobody taking care of me 

I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me 
When I get myself ready it has got to be an equal pay 

[Chorus]

Don't want to be no no no one else
I'd rather rescue myself 

I can slay my own dragon
I can dream my own dreams

But when I close my eyes at night
All I dream of now is home

I haven`t slept in my own bed
Oh, I`m dreamin' of home

Home is where the heart is (where the heart is)

The Chelsea Strings,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

The Chelsea Strings,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1995

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

He's gone, / he's gone. /


She wears sad jeans / torn at the waistband. /
Her pretty face / is stained with tears. /
And in her right hand / she clasps a letter; /
I know this means / that he has gone. /


And in this town / of mis-guided tourists, /
She never thought / she'd fall in love. /
It was a few days / after her birthday, /
The thrill hostess / gave her first kiss. /


He said her skin / smelled just like petals, /
Said stupid things / he knew she'd like. /
She said her life / was like a motorway: /
Dull, grey, and long / 'til he came along. /


He's gone, / he's gone. /


I said ""how could / he ever leave you? /
You two were good, / you were so right."" /
She said ""I wish / that he just left me; /
He'd be alive, / alive tonight."" /

The Chemical Brothers,"Out of control 
Out of control 
Out of control 

Sometimes I fell that I misunderstood 
The rivers run and deep right through my thought 
Your naked body lying on the ground 
You always get me up when I'm down 

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time, 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
Out of control 

Maybe I'm just scared of losin' you 
Or maybe it's the things you make me do 
It seems to me we both should hang around 
And raise the population of this town 

And it always seems we're runnin' out of time, 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

But it doesn't mean we're too far down the line 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

The record player keeps on turning round 
It could be stuck or maybe it's a sound 
All the time I should be there with you 
But maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth 
Or maybe I'm just searchin' for the truth 

And it always seems we're running out of time. 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

But it doesn't mean we're too far down the line 
We're out of control 
Out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control 

Could be that I'm just losing my touch 
Or maybe you think my mustache is too much 
Satellite is out of control 
But you and I are brothers of the soul 
And you and I will come in from the cold 

Out of control, out of control 
We're out of control 
Out of control",Out of Control,1999

Devil came by this morning, 
said he had something to show me, 
I was looking like I'd never seen a face before, 
here we go now lets slide in through the open door.

Pictures and things that I've done before,
circling around me I'm here on the floor,
I'm dreaming this and I'm dreaming that,
regretting nothing think about that.

I can't explain where I've been,
