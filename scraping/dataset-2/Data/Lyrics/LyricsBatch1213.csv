[Music by Mactatus]

I am the voice

Midnight shimmering
Why can't you just open your mind
I'm tired of listening to the screams
Which comes from inside
Try to sleep now in solitude you shall awake
Sleep as a child all I feel is he's shattering gaze
Come with me I'll protect you from the voices within
I can't I wish I was close to you I can't bear this pain

Adrian please wake me...

Screams are shattering your vains
Promises only pain shall remain
Why do you struggle your fear
My gaze shall shatter your stear
Why do you petty yourself
Why can't you reach out instead
Why won't you trust me I am your voice you shall see...

There's no sleep tonight
Flashing memories fills my mind
I fell so close to you
Can't you stay with me until eternity

Screams shall forever reach your mind
Why, cause only one day you shall be mine
Creation of souls I make them blind
Eternal, soon they shall all be mine...

Tony Adamo,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2007

Debajo de esas dos cejas

Tony Alamo,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more

Tony Allen," really don't feel like talking on the phone
And I really don't feel like company at home
Lately I don't want to do the things I used to do
Baby since I lost you

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I dont' want to live my life without you babe yeah
It's driving me crazy (crazy)

I really don't feel like smiling anymore
And I haven't had the peace to sleep at all
Ever since you went away, baby my whole life has changed
I don't want to love and I don't want to live

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I dont' want to live my life without you babe no
It's driving me crazy (Crazy)
Tell I don't wanna laugh, I don't wanna play
I don't wanna talk, have nothing to say
I don't want to tour, forget the show how can I go on
Now that you are gone (On)
Babe No, sing another love song baby, and I don't want to, No way,

Tony Allen,"I want to run, I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside
I wanna reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I want to feel sunlight on my face
I see that dust cloud disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name, oh oh

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do

The city's a flood
And our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled into dust

I'll show you a place
High on the desert plain
Where the streets have no name, oh oh

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do

Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do",Where the Streets Have No Name,2008
Tony Almerico,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1955
Tony Anderson,"To all the girls I've loved before,
who traveled in and out my door.
I'm glad they came along,
I dedicate this song
to all the girls I've loved before.
To all the girls I once caressed,
and may I say, I've held the best,
for helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I know, 
to all the girls I've loved before.
The winds of change are always blowing
and ev'ry time I tried to stay.
The winds of change continued blowing,
and they just carried me a way.
 
To all the girls who shared my life,
who now are someone else's wife;
I'm glad they came along,
I dedicate this song
to all the girls I've loved before.
To all the girls who cared for me,
who filled my nights with ecstacy;
they live within my heart;
I'll always be a part of all the girls I've loved before.
the winds of change are always blowing
and ev'ry time I tried to stay.

Tony Anderson,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, baby of my heart",I Just Called to Say I Love You,2000
Tony Anderson Orchestra,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Tony Andriacchi,"Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in, day out","Day in, Day Out",2006
Tony Andriacchi,"Hello, such a simple way to start a love affair
Should I jump right in and say how much I care?
Would you take me for the madness of a simple-hearted clown?

Hello, with affection from a sentimental fool
From a little girl who's broken every rule
One who brings me up when all the others seem to let me down
One who's nice to be around

Should I say that it's a blue world without you
Nice words I remember from an old love song
But all wrong 'cause I've never called it love before
This feeling's new, it came with you

Oh, and I know that the nicest things have never seemed to last
That we're both a bit embarrassed by our past
But I think there's something special in the feelings that we've found
And you're nice to be around, and you're nice to be around",Nice to Be Around [From the Film Cinderella Liberty],2006
Tony Arata,"Looking back to the memory of 
The dance we shared 'before the stars alone 
For a moment all the world was right 
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye 

And now I'm glad I didn't know 
The way it all would end the way it all would go 
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain 
But I'd of had to miss the dance 

Holding you I held everything 
For a moment wasn't I a king 
But if I'd only known how the king would fall 
Hey who's to say you know I might have chanced it all 

And now I'm glad I didn't know 
The way it all would end the way it all would go 
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain 
But I'd of had to miss the dance 

Yes my life is better left to chance 
I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance",The Dance,1996
Tony Arata,"I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God
That they never would

And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good

I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin someone home

Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own

I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

We can do some livin'
or spend our whole lives hopin'
In the end we're left with
The ones we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open",Dreaming with My Eyes Open,1999
Tony Arata,"You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
It has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance that tide
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll tke soome falls
With the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Lord, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Tony Argo,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1960
Tony Argo,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1960
Tony Armani,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Tony Ashton,"Choose yourself a partner
From the middle of the floor
Blow a little kiss
To the woman next door

Held by the sand, washed by the waves 
A shadow forms cast by a cloud
Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them, effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""
More opened ears and opened eyes
And soon they dared to laugh

To go, go-woh, go-woh

Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, they're asking us to leave

I've told you before, 's good many gone if we let them stay
And if it isn't easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away

After all this time, they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent

Seeing as how they'd take more money

With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found

Here we are in Harlow New Town 
Did you recognize your block across the square, over there

We've found we've had to raise the rent again
Just a bit

Oh no, this I can't believe 
Oh Mary, and we agreed to leave

This is an announcement from Genetic Control
It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on 
Humanoid height 

I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the 
Properties that have recently been sold, taking risks oh so bold
It's said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
They say it's alright
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity, they've been told they must go
Told they must go-go-go-go

I think I've fixed a new deal 
A dozen properties, we'll buy at five and sell at thirty four

Tony Banks,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""

Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor 
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey 
That scars the panes.

And the weak must die according to nature's law 
As old as they.

Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea.

Already I feel a creeping coldness chilling my bones,
Dulling my sight and mind.
Soon there shall be only sand where once water flowed.
Nature dies and is reborn, but I shan't weather this coming storm.
Not for me to die with children around my bed
After a happy life,
Though rain will fall and the sun won't change in its course.

It's hard to bear but harder still
To tell the one I care for,
Please to say love is here today, but it's going away, going away.

Tony Banks,"How strange I never noticed
Your eyes, or the color of your hair.
It seems to me you grow more beautiful
In every way.
With every single passing day.
Love crept in unseen,
Found me wanting
I didn't even have the sense to know
What I was missing,
Or what I was soon to feel for
You the laughter,
You a reason to live.
You the object of all the love I can give,
And all that I possess.
You who meant nothing when I was younger
It seems a memory from another life.
Did you ever think we'd meet this way,
Feel this way.
Did you really even care?
Some changes I foresaw,
But not this one.
This feeling I would not have understood.
Strange to think
I might have lived my whole life without

Link arms like policemen in a chain,

And the thunder noise surrounds us,
Now I can laugh amid the storm,
Like a child in the warm,
I feel your sunlight shining on me,
All around me, inside me.

Then high in the sky, a star appears to be winking,
A branch caught by the wind, its leaves beckon to me.
Stone still at my feet, its gray matches my thinking,
Well water so deep, its song calling me down, down, down

Now in the street I stand deserted,
With the cold and wet returning,
I turn, rejoining the crowd,
Like a leave caught in the stream,
I need you now like it needed to rain.

Climbing cross the hills on pathways,

Got to know who you are,
Got to know from where you come,

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide,

Undisturbed by the sound, with noiseless tread,
A figure comes into view,
A trail of magic runs behind him,
The Man of Spells has come to visit you,
He knows how much you really want him,
He knows just what you all want him to do.

Drawn back cloak revealing,
Wraith-like form concealing,
Half-seen eyes unseeing,
Half-heard words beseeching,

Help me now I need you.

Leaving just a tired old man,

Tony Banks,"On a cold clear night in November,
All the people have gone to bed.
We found ourselves upon a cliff edge,
Looking out to sea.
Then a sight in the pale moonlight,
Made us shake our heads in dismay,
A wave taller than the tallest tree
Bore down on she and me.
All the hopes and dreams we had
Dissolved amidst the fear,
What I'd be without you know,
Only the stars could ever tell.

From the window of our hotel room,
We look out on the city below,
Driven lights move randomly,
The never ending show,
And when the bells start ringing,
We have fifty floors to go,
What I'd be... without you now,
Only the stars could ever tell.

Say you'll never leave me, never leave me alone.
Say you'll never leave me, never leave me alone.

On a lake, we cling to the rail,
On the back of a sailing boat,
A mist falls around us,
Now becalmed we float,
Then from behind comes a warning sound,
We're helplessly adrift,
Still, we see nothing,
And then we see the ship.

High above it dwarfs us,
There's nowhere we can go.
What I'd be without you now,
Only the stars could ever tell.

Say you'll never leave me, never leave me alone,
Say you'll never leave me, never leave me alone,

So lost without your love.",Say You'll Never Leave Me,1983

How it is that we survive,

And if the other don't get you then another one surely will.

Let me lead you to the light
A chance is all there's ever gonna be
It's here let's take a hold
The gift is mine tonight - tonight

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

I've thought of how it could be in the future everyday
I've thought of all the good things in the past
Everyday, every night.
I shouted at the sky but the sky was deaf
I looked into the ashes but the heat had all left
I never dreamed that it could be this way again

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

And I don't care if the cost is great
Stop and think about it, it's too late
The sails are set, the tide has turned
Time to go explore the world
The winds are blowing but its warm inside my soul
As we turn and leave the shore
The gift is mine tonight

The magic look is in your eye
The power to move and satisfy
And the promise that you bring to me
Lifts me up and sets me free.

Tony Banks,"I was walking along at the end of the day
I was walking along when it began to rain
And by the edge of the path was a suitable tree
I decided to wait there patiently

Then a scream cut through the air
And a voice spoke much too near
""Little girl you're on your own
You're so scared and far from home""
I knew what I was meant to do
I should go to the young girl's aid
Act like a man be a hero strong and brave

I pictured myself front page news
Headline story hero for an hour
But my natural nature got the better of me
I took to my heels and I fled so fast
That only when I was miles away
Did I catch my breath and slow down
To a walk and then to rest

Well I was walking along when it came to me
That maybe I'd acted to hastily
And that the thing to do was to go on back
To be of help yes be the hero of the the hour
So I retraced my steps in the gathering gloom
Till I thought I was back where I started from
I searched and looked but I couldn't find
I was very relieved if you know what I mean

And then I heard a voice behind
I was rooted to the spot
""Little man you're on your own
You're so scared and far from home""
You take me for a fool I know
To return to the lion's den
I felt lost and confused and about to be misused
I felt the time had come to do what I do best
Time to do the thing that I do better than the rest
I let my natural nature get the better of me
I took to my heels and I fled so fast
That only when I was miles away
Did I catch my breath and slow down
To a walk and then to rest

Got the whole thing down by numbers.
All those numbers!

O Lord I need that now.

The day of judgement's come,
And you can bet that I've been resting,
for this testing,
Digesting every word the experts say.

Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Found a girl I wanted to date,
Thought I'd better get it straight.
Went to buy a book before it's too late.
Don't leave nothing to fate.
I studied every line, every page in the book,
Now, I've got the real thing here, I'm gonna take a look, take a look.

This is Rael!

I'm counting out time, hoping it goes like I planned it,
'cause I understand it. Look! I've found the hotspots, Figs 1-9.
Still counting out time, got my finger on the button,
""Don't say nuttin' just lie there still
And I'll get you turned on just fine.""
Erogenous zones I love you.
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Touch and go with 1-6.
Bit of trouble in zone No. 7.
Gotta remember all of my tricks.
There's heaven ahead in No. 11!

Whipee!""

Hoping they'll find peace

That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.",Penthouse Serenade (When We're Alone),
Tony Bennett,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around,
Tony Bennett,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,
Tony Bennett,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

So tender is the night

Should tomorrow find us disenchanted

As though they knew the way

Oh the tricks your mind can play

It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the close, you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we´re swept apart, too soon

Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is
Near, tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
We´re late, darling, we´re late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon

I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon",Speak Low,1960

I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again

About to take that ride again

Or I'll never fall in love

Is when I fall in love with you.

Yesterday, perhaps

Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by

Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you

Some day you'll say goodbye

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

Who would find you the cups for the pink lemonade?

And the soft winds are crisp with their wintry chill

I will set these wonders

Someone warm like you would make my dream come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say this is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

For once I can say this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it

Tony Bennett,"One day we walked along the sand
One day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend its broken wing
Now I'll remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
The shadow of a smile

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love and see
All the lovely things
You are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1986
Tony Bennett,"Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fears and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Tony Bennett,"As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure
All the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede
That this is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
And I will stay younger than Spring",This Is All I Ask,1986

Tony Bennett,"I often wonder why you came to me
Brought such a flame to me
Then let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye
With every new love you'll come back to me
In other eyes it's you I'll see

If I love again, though it's someone new
If I love again, it will still be you

In someone's else's fond embrace
I'll close my eyes and see your face
If I love again I'll find other charms
But I'll make-believe you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper ""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving you every time I love again",If I Love Again,1993
Tony Bennett,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
In the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trout stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me",Lazy Afternoon,1993
Tony Bennett,"Something in your smile speaks to me
Something in your eyes shows me the way
And helps me to say the things
That I could never say to you

Something in your voice sings to me
Something in your laugh makes me rejoice
And there is no choice except
To let my thoughts all stray to you and stray to you they do

Something in you is rich and rare
And there is something more
Something in you is everything
That I never knew before

Something of your charm clings to me
Something of your warmth shows me the way
And made me a part of you for just a little while
So think of me as something in your smile
Think of me as something in your smile",Something in Your Smile,1993
Tony Bennett,"Yesterday I heard the rain whispering your name
Asking where you'd gone
It fell softly from the clouds on the silent crowds
As I wandered on
Out of doorways black umbrellas came to pursue me
Faceless people as they passed were looking through me
No one knew me

Yesterday I shut my eyes, face up to the skies
Drinking in the rain
But your image still was there, floating in the air
Brighter than a flame

Yesterday I saw a city
Full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain
Whispering your name

And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.

To be young at heart.
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart.

Look at all you'll derive out of being alive!
And here is the best part, you have a head start

Under an August moon burning above

It's because I've got a date

I won't waste your time

Why I feel sublime, go

Tony Bennett,"Since you're gone I spend each lonely night
Dealing out the cards from left to right
And the queen of hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone just playing solitaire

Love was just another game for two
I see now that's all it meant to you
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
Now I'm all alone just playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance
The gamble to win or to lose
You play to win
Then you find you're playing in a game with no rules, just made for fools
Now the joker has the laugh on me
Cuz I played my hand so carelessly
And until you want to share that old feeling
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire

Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours, a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Blue velvet

Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

How do you make it last
How do you keep a song from fading too fast

How do you lose yourself to someone

How do you not run out of new things to say

And if we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name

I know the way I feel for you, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Could make me be true or even be glad
Just to be sad, thinking of you

Some others I've seen, might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do 
For nobody else gave me a thrill 
With all your faults I love you still

It had to be you, 
Wonderful you, it had to be you",It Had to Be You,2004

Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, weÂ´re swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is
near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
WeÂ´re late, darling, weÂ´re late

She said I was the best man

I was the A plus number 1 guy

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again

Tony Bennett,"Love is wrong, it sings a hopeless song
It longs for bitter disappointment and tears, and tears
It calls to all that used to be
And it yearns for someone who was tender but untrue

To bind itself to discontentment and fears, and fears
It [Incomprehensible] on nights that might have been

We knew, we knew
Endlessly I unfold each word we've spoken

I want to be a part of it, New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it, New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

These little town blues, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it, in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

One more busted guardrail
One more safety net shot to hell

The maps, they are of no use
I'm blind

Your cab speeds away in the rain
But there's a guest that'll soon be showing up again
I recognize her all-too-familiar face
'Cause here comes heartache

Who knows how we got this far

Wasn't it always written in the stars?

I've have found a way to start

Delivered your good-bye with many a tear

One for the best supporting break

It was your movie from the very start

Forgot all my lines, so I gave you my heart
I got a review that you wrote

And realize our dreams could never be
I'll even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me

No one will ever know how much I'm pining
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears I'm hiding
You've hurt me, but no one will ever know

Papa's not president since maybe tonight
When you're not quite so sure that Mom's always right
Baby, you've got growing pains
Nothing's wrong, just growing pains
And they'll never hurt too long

When there are cobwebs in dreams that you weave
When there's no magic in the words 'Make believe'
When doubt comes peeping out and tugs at your sleeve
Baby, you've got growing pains

When you come home from school and don't slam the door
Ride down the banisters or slide 'cross the floor

Brighter than a flame

Full of shadows without pity

Although I know they're really green.
I seem to see you dif-f'rent-ly;
Changing as I'm treated kindly,
Or treated meanly.
From moment to moment
You're two different people,
Faithful and warm, when I'm in your arms,
And then, when you leave,
You're so untrue.

But
How
Ever you are,
Deep down whatever you are,
Whoever you are, I love you.

Sometimes, I feel you're mine alone,
And yet I'm sure it's just not so.
I get this feeling on my own;
After I learn if you're staying,
Or if you're going.

Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear

Lives my favorite girl
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown ups all wear

In the sun she dances to silent music
Songs that are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head

One day all too soon
She'll grow up and she'll leave her dolls
And her prince and her silly old bear

When she goes they will cry
As they whisper good-bye
They will miss her I fear

I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ahh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,2011

Tony Bennett,"O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,
 It is the night of the dear saviour's birth.
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
 For yonder breaks a news and glorious morn,

 Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices.
 O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
 O night divine, O night, O night divine.

 Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
 With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
 So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
 Here came the wise men from the Orient land.
 The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
 In all our trials born to be our friend.

 He knows our need, He guardeth us from danger;
 Behold your King, before Him lowly bend!
 Behold you King, before Him lowly bend!

 Fall on your knees! etc.",O Holy Night,2011

Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear

Lives my favorite girl,
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown ups all wear

In the sun she dances to silent music,
Songs that are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head

One day all too soon

Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

With distingué traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your pointed smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so assured
Now life is awful again
A thoughtful of heart
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will
Oh yet you are still

I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh you cry

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
Oh no, sophisticated lady,
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh
When nobody is nigh
Nobody is nigh you cry",Sophisticated Lady,2014
Tony Bennett,"They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said ""The world was round""
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said ""Man could fly""

They told Marconi, wireless was a phony

It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon

But all you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy

They laughed at us and how!

Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
And now they're fighting to get in

They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin

They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie, he kept the laughers busy

That's how people are

They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""Hello, Goodbye""

But all you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together

Darling, take a bow
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?",They All Laughed,2014

The sequel's never quite as good

Another feature attraction

All we need now is a half decent plot

Got it - an epic love story between a very handsome long nosed purple thing and
A beautiful chicken, Gonzo with the wind

Does anybody have any other ideas

OH OH! It's about getting the Muppets back together again
to stop an evil oil baron from demolishing the old studio

Fozzie, did you even watch our last film

How about one of those fish out of water movies

Yeah, I'm not so sure about that Lew

It's about a frog who marries a beautiful, perfect pig, and they have to kiss each other a lot

Ah

I don't think Americans watch subtitled films

How about a movie where you don't make a movie
And we all get to go home early

Good Grief

It's about a lonely dog, and one night, he sees something he should never have seen
And he has to live with a terrible secret

Uh, that sounds a little dark, Rowlf

Kermit, how about The Muppets go on a world tour

Is love and unity to all God's children

And the whole day should be spent

Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
