Marty Paich Dek-tette,"What's your story, morning glory?
What makes you look so blue?
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory?
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view?

What is your story, morning glory?
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it? Then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory?
Give your answer to this patient romancer
Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too?",What's Your Story Morning Glory,2013
Marty Paich Quartet,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1956
Marty Paich Quartet,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A  Foggy Day,2017
Marty Paich Quintet,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"The moment I saw her face, I knew she was just my style.
My only regret is we've never met for I dream of her all the while,
But she doesn't know I exist, no matter how I persist.
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me,
Though I live at fifty-one thirty-five Kensington Avenue,
And she lives at fifty-one thirty three.

How can I ignore the girl next door, I love her more than I can say.
Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me,
And she never sees me glance her way.
And I thought I'm heart sore, the girl next door
Affection for me won't display.
I just adore her so I can't ignore her, the girl next door.",The Girl Next Door,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"The night is young, the skies are clear
And if you want to go walkin', dear
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

I understand the reason why
You're sentimental 'cause so am I
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

I can tell at a glance
What a swell night this is for romance
I can hear old mother nature murmuring low

""Let yourself go,"" please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
""It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely,"" second chorus

Time marches on, and soon it's plain
You've won my heart and I've lost my brain
""It's delightful, it's delicious, it is de-lovely
Life seems so sweet that we decide
It's in the bag to get unified
""It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

See the crowd at that church
See the proud parson plopped in his perch
Get the sweet beat of that organ pealing our doom
Here goes the groom, boom, how they cheeer
How they smile, as we go galloping down the aisle
It's divine, dear, it's da-veen, dear, it's da-wunderbar
It's da-victory, it's da-wallop, it's da-vinner, it's da-voice, it's de-lovely

It's de-lovely

The loudest time and so we take a few hours out to eat wedding cake
It's delightful, it is delicious, it is de-lovely
It feels fine to be a bride, and how's the groom, we'll he's slightly fried
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

It's de-lousy, it's de-reely, it's da-rhapsody, it's de-referee, 
It's de-Royal, it's de-Regal, it's de-Ritz, it's true, it's de-lovely

It's del-lovely, thank you",It's De-Lovely,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Marty Paich Quintet,"Never saw such perfect beauty before
Never saw such charming manners what's more
Never saw such eyes of heavenly blue
Never saw what I see looking at you

I could never weary
Looking at you, looking at you

All thro' life, my dearie
Looking at you, looking at you

Wish that I was able
To make you say, ""I do""

And sit across the breakfast table
Looking at you, looking at you",Looking at You,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"That certain night, the night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I may be right, I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turn'd and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know that we were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And when we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkley, nightingale sang in Berkley
Nightingale sang in Berkley
Square",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"Nobody's heart belongs to me.
Heigh-ho, who cares?
Nobody writes his songs to me.
No one belongs to me
That's the least of my cares.
I may be sad at times, and disinclined to play,
But it's not bad at times to go your own sweet way.
Nobody's arms belong to me,
No arms feel strong to me.
I admire the moon
As a moon,
Just a moon.
Nobody's heart belongs to me today.

Ride, Amazon, ride.
Hunt your stags and bears.
Take life in its stride.
Heigh-ho, who cares?
Go hunting with pride,
Track bears to their lairs.
Ride, Amazon, ride.
Heigh-ho, who cares?

Nobody's heart belongs to me.
Heigh-ho, that's bad.
Love's never sung her songs to me.
I have never been had.
I've had no trial in the game of man and maid.
I'm like a violin that no one's ever played.
Words about love are Greek to me.
Nice girls won't speak to me.
I despise the moon
As a moon,
It's a prune.
Nobody's heart belongs to me today.",Nobody's Heart,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,2008
Marty Paich Quintet,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you

And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,2008

Tripping in the starlight, Lord and I'm feeling down
Walking in the shadows, sneaking down a side road
Come early morning I'll be there on the edge of town

Thinking bout a sweet dream, in my honey's eyes
And I was a sinking', feeling kind of lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side

I have drifted up across the mountain
and I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied

Tried to be a man, tried not to weep.
Now I hear the turning of the key,
Silently, the guard motions to me.
Now realize the end is near
And I find I can't control my fear.
As I pass the guard, I start to cry,
And I whisper, ""I don't want to die!""
Then from death row comes a whisper, ""Charlie, be a man.""
And I scream, ""Just wait till your turn, then see if you can!""


Down the hall they push and carry me.
Blind with fright and tears won't let me see.
Through a door and then I stop and stare,
'cause I see it, there it is, THE CHAIR.
Then they strap me in and turn to leave,
And the prison chaplain says ""Believe,
Faith in God will cause him to forgive.""
I have faith, but still I want to live.
Suddenly, I'm paralyzed, this must be the end.
My body jerks and trembles as they turn it on again.
Quickly as it came, the pain is gone.
I hear music, someone sings a song.
Suddenly I seem to float through air.
Something's wrong 'cause I'm still in THE CHAIR.
In the room there's hardly any light,
Now I see a doctor dressed in white.
I hear every word, it's plainly said.
Did I hear them say, ""This man is dead?""
Did I hear them say, ""This man is dead?

Like the winds that bring high tides, you bring sorrow and grief

Marty Robbins,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would fine me in Rosa's Cantina,
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, wild as the west Texas wind...
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of rose's I ran, out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.

Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso,
Out through the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark...
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.

And as last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rosa's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
A deep burning pain in my side. 
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle, 
I'm getting weary, unable to ride. 
But my love for 
Felina is strong and I writhe where I've fallen. 
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest 

I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.
From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina good-bye.",ElPaso,1959
Marty Robbins,"I'm as sad as the willow
That weeps in the valley
Since you've gone,
Since you've gone from my arms

I'm as sad as the cold wind
That rythes in the treetops,
I'll be lonesome until you return

Come back, come back,
Come back to the valley,
Come back to this poor cowboy's arms

I will weep like the willow
That weeps in the valley,
I'll be lonesome until you return

Marty Robbins,"When I was but a young man,I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy went bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living, leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master's call
 
One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started then out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout
 
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name
 
So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground
 
I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When another bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow
 
My wicked past unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason,life is his to take or give 
 
A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade nearly six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried in vain for mercy kneeling there upon the ground
 
A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy seas
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I learned that much and more the night the Saviour called my name",The Master’sCall,1959
Marty Robbins,"When I hear the raindrops comin' down it makes me sad and blue
Was on a rainy night like this that Flo said we were through.
I told her how I loved her, and I begged her not to go
But another man had changed her mind so I said goodbye to Flo.

Alone within my cell tonight my heart is filled with fear
The only sound within the room is the falling of each tear.
I think about the thing I've done, I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow, but they're hanging me tonight.

That night he came and took my Flo and headed in to town
I knew I had to find this man and try to gun him down
As I walked by a dim cafe and I looked through the door
I saw my Flo with her new love and I couldn't stand no more,
I couldn't stand no more.

I took my pistol from my hip and with a trembling hand
I took the life of pretty Flo and that good for nothin' man
That good for nothin' man!

I think about the thing I've done, I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow, but they're hanging me tonight.

And so they couldn't rest

And the nights were cold as steel

And the desert promised death

He treasured every breath

Close behind the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans

When first they saw the killer

He was by the waterhole

Five rifles rang out through the night

They killed the gambler cold

Five brothers and three in their teens

Finally got the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans


The desert is their keeper now

For this a traveler said

That poison lived within the hole

Now six of them are dead

Lay beside the man

Who killed their pa in New Orleans

Lay beside the man

My love is the prairie the low rollin' hills the rollin' hills

The call of the night bird I love every trill

Marty Robbins,"North of the border of Old Mexico
I rode one day to the cowtown of San Angelo
A hot sun was glowing, a hot breeze was blowing
Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to kiss

She sent a message a long time ago
Secora had promised to meet me in San Angelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this girl 

I must be with her I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few minutes more and she'll be at my side

At ten o' clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the street
Where was Secora, had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to meet
But something is wrong with our plans and I fear death awaits me
Here on this hot dusty street. 

Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with a rifle, it's pointed at me
I might escape from the man with a rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot see 

Back of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me run
Where is Secora, will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from a door down the street 

""Up on your horse"", she is crying
""Ride out of town it's a trap and they're waiting for you""
But if I ride out, she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are gone
For a bullet is well on its way and it finds my Secora
She cries as she falls in my arms 

Over and over her soft lips did say
""Now we're together, I won't let them take you away""
One little sigh, her little lips tremble
Then it was over, Secora had drifted away 

Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me
I rise to meet him, my one thought it beat him
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will die 

I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets could fly
My gun is empty or more I would shoot him
Now there are others just like him that want me to die
Their bullets are coming my way, how they hurt when they hit me
The pain makes me fall to the ground. 

Gone is my strength, just the will left to fight
I hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of life
If I must die, let me find Secora
Let me hold on to her hand for the few moments left 

Blindly I search and it isn't in vain
I touch the soft velvet hand and it eases the pain
Life is no more but we're together
Even in death she's my lover,
It's over,
Goodbye",San Angelo,1960
Marty Robbins,"She was young and she was pretty she was warm and tender too
She was all a man could ask for but her heart could not be true
No her heart could not be true
Eyes that sparkle just like diamonds lips as fresh as morning dew

She was young and she was fickle and her heart could not be true
No her heart could not be true
Cheeks just like a rose when blooming and a form so fine and rare
Curls that hung below her shoulders gold the color of her hair

Now she's gone no one can claim her in my cell I'm sad and blue
One bright night I shot and killed her she was young and so untrue
She was young and so untrue
One bright night I watched another kissed her like I used to do

So I drew my gun and killed her she was young and so untrue
In the morning just at daybreak when the roses kissed the dew
I shall hang because I killed her she was young and so untrue

Marty Robbins,"Long long ago in old Wyoming lived a maid
Fair as the sweetest flower bloomin' in the shade
She loved a bandit bold who roamed the prairie o'er
And every night she'd listen for his call

Then far the west his voice came ringing ridin' wild horse he came singing
Hee li oli yip ioli ay
Hee li oli yip ioli yip ay oli ya he brings a token of his love
Swift as the wind he goes for high as the hills he knows she's waiting

For his hee li oli yip ioli ay
One day he rode away but never to return
Danger was waitin' now his love must never yearn
Long days and lonely nights she waited all in vain

'Til winter passed and summer came again
Still every night when the moon came shining for his song her heart was pining
Hee li oli yip ioli ay
Hee li oli yip ioli...

One night an angel brought a message from her love
Told her he waited in the starry sky above
Softly she closed her eyes and bade the angel go
And then the whole world echoed to his song

For straight down a moonbeam he came ridin' out of the sky on a winged horse glidin' Hee li oli yip ioli ay

Marty Robbins,"I'm just a poor cowboy singin' his song
No money to jingle as I ride along
I'm rejected by men but accepted above
I belong in this valley on this peaceful sod

Let me ride from the mountains to the dark rolling sea
I'm broke but I'm wealthy because I am free
Let me walk in this valley where my fathers had trod
Let me live forever on this peaceful sod

Let me live on this land till I'm withered and old
Till I'm meek and I'm humble and the Lord wants my soul
Let me live in this valley where my fathers had trod
Let me live forever on this peaceful sod






",This Peaceful Sod,1960
Marty Robbins,"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a-one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky.

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for.

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play deguello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...

Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing and the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

To the thirteen days of glory
At the siege of Alamo...",Ballad of the Alamo [*],1960
Marty Robbins,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"",  came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip""

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip",Big Iron,1961

Marty Robbins,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there In silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone, in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, then Felina good-bye",El Paso,1961
Marty Robbins,"From this valley they say you are leaving
We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For you take with you all of the sunshine
That has brightened our pathway a while

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy that's loved you so true

For a long time, my darlin', I've waited
For the sweet words you never would say
Now at last all my fond hopes have vanished
For they say that you're going away

Then come sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu

And the cowboy that's loved you so true",Red River Valley,1961
Marty Robbins,"Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way yet to go
He started his long ride in Prescott
The sun was a hundred or more
On down he rode at full gallop
Into the flat desert floor
Driving the big herd to Flagstaff
In Prescott the letter was there
Happiness soon would be sorrow
Sad news the letter did bear
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't go too slow

Racked by fever and pain

Pushing through mesquite and sage
His head never raised for a greeting
As he passed the Wickenburg stage
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
Tucson's a mighty long way to go
In Phoenix he traded horses
Now on the back of this roan
He could see visions of Tucson
His darlin' and their lovely home
Ride, cowboy, ride
Don't ride too slow
There's still a hundred and twenty to go
In through the ranch gate he galloped
And without breaking his stride
He bounded out of the saddle
And rushed to his sweet darlin's side
Then as the dyin' girl saw him
A smile came over her face
Holding her hand as it tightened
Barely had he won the race

Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me

I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy

Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die

Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips, then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead

Slowly but surely we fell in love
How did it happen, it's easy to see
We didn't rush things ,we loved progressively

First came a smile and then we held hands
Much later came the kiss

If you search then you'll find
Progressive love won't miss

Marty Robbins,"The days of my youth I remember so well
We lived in a world all our own
Nobody cared where my money came from
If I had it I wasn't alone

Oh, the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine
How they all loved me back then
But here in my prison I'm sitting alone
And now where are all of my friends

So drink and be merry if that is your wish
Your souls, to the Lord, I commend
Remember some day you may be as I am
With nothing, not even a friend

Oh, the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine
How they all loved me back then
But here in my prison I'm sitting alone
And now where are all of my friends

So here's to the freedom I never will have
For me it's not long to the end
But it's better to die then to spend forty years
With the cold prison walls for a friend

Oh, the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine
How they all loved me back then
But here in my prison I'm sitting alone
And now where are all of my friends

Walk my way and a thousand violins began to play

This music I hear I get misty whenever you're near
You can say that you lead me on but it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost that's why I'm following you

I met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

She came and sat down at my table
And when she put her soft hand in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip my self of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

We danced and she whispered, ?I need you
Take me away from here and be my man?
Then as I looked in her eyes, I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home

Of the hardship and the pain that you went through
Know you ,Lord, that I am ready and I'm waiting
For a little spot in Heaven close to you

Precious Lord, forget me not don't pass me by
Though there must be others worthier than I
If you can then, Lord, here's what I'll have you do
Save a little spot in Heaven close to you

If my wish is more than I deserve, forgive me
Up in Heaven any place would surely do
But I've done my best on earth that's why I'm asking
For a little spot in Heaven close to you

And as time went on the love in my heart grew
If it isn't asking too much, Lord, then save me

Why do you fall like winter rain?
It's too late now
For she won't be back again
And there's nothing you can do
To ease this longing in my heart
For I'll miss her just as long as we're apart

All of that is over now
And I tried to make her happy
But I failed her somewhere, somehow

Were are the shining stars above?
Do you miss them
As I'll always miss my love?

All night long until the dawn
For I know that I can't sleep now that she's gone.

But I've been almost happy for just the past two years
The word's out that she's come back and the thought makes me tremble
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember

Seconds to remember all the things that used to be
Seconds to remember how much she meant to me
Love has burst a flame from a dying ember
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember

As I recall the day she left with somebody new
I vowed that I'd forget her any way I could
The minute I heard she was back I felt the same old hunger
It took two years to forget her and just seconds to remember

That it isn't half as funny as before

Sixteen weeks ago tonight I really played a fool
Made a big mistake, but everybody does
Lately, though, I've done some cryin' 'cause I find
That it isn't half as funny as it was

Then I realized how long you'd been away
Don't know how much more of this my heart can take
Wish I'd known the difference sixteen weeks could make

With your thoughts so disarranged you couldn't sleep
Then you wish that you could sort out all your memories
And set aside just the ones you wanna keep

I have learned how to sort out my memories
And the ones that hurt I've learned to push aside
And with tears I've built a wall of just the sad ones
There the ones of you I've hidden deep inside

If you've spent one night like this, well, then you're lucky
'Cause I've spent a million thinkin' of the things we've done

Our love to you was take and never give
You destroyed the world that I had built around you
And left me without a world in which to live

Would you take me back again
If I had done these things to you
If I'd made you live through only half
Of what you put me through
If within your heart you knew I'd do
The same things once again
Tell me, darlin, would you take me back again

To you my feelin's never really mattered
Everything was your way or no way at all
You never cared if all my dreams were shattered
Instead of helping me to stand you let me fall

Would you take me back again
If I had done these things to you
If I'd made you live through only half
Of what you put me through

The same things once again

As chapel bells chime

",Chapel Bells Chime,1967
Marty Robbins,"In my wandering days I wandered south of the border
I ended up in a little Mexican town
Was there I met a lovely senorita
There she offered her heart if I promised I'd settle down
Love beyond compare eternally happy
This could have been but I just had to wander instead
As I rode away with tears in her eyes she was pleading
I can still see her tears I can still hear the words she said
Don't go away senor don't go away
Don't go away senor don't go away don't go away don't go away

Guess my wanderin' is through I just can't forget her
My love for her keeps pulling deep down within
There's nothin' to do but ride back south of the border
And beg her forgiveness and never wander again
Don't go away senor...




",Don't Go Away Senor,1967
Marty Robbins,"Love's gone away she never wanted to stay
Hours go by each one seem like a day when love's gone away

My eyes look but they don't see...
Love's gone away...
Love's gone away...

Today was to be a day of fun and fiesta
The wedding day of Juan and lovely Vanessa
Inside the chapel only the padre remains
Everyone waited but Vanessa she never came.

Oh, only sorrow at the mission in Guadalajara
No fiesta, no laughing, no singing
No wedding bells will be ringing
Only sorrow in Guadalajara.

[--- Instrumental ---]

And every year on that very same day in September
He lights a candle and prays that she will remember
Inside the chapel he begs the padre to stay
He swears Vanessa will surely be here today.

Oh, only sorrow at the mission in Guadalajara
No fiesta, no laughing, no singing
No wedding bells will be ringing
Only sorrow in Guadalajara.

She loves and wants me and her love to me she'll surrender
This girl with the black eyes and skin touched by hot winds and sunshine
Will be waiting in Reno tonight and this is the night she'll be mine
Waiting in Reno for my arms to find her and hold her
Waiting and hoping that I will not be far behind her
Black eyes and red ruby lips excitement in her fingertips
Passion is there on her lips she'll be waiting in Reno tonight

It's been so long since I've seen her but I still remember
The tears in the dark eyes when I said that I had to leave her
And the way that her lips stayed on mine like a warm burning ember

What have I done that has made you so distant and cold

I cannot offer you clothes your young body crave

If I could hold and kiss her once again
Then if I should die tomorrow after loving her tonight

She's mine she's mine she's mine




",Early Morning Sunshine,1971
Marty Robbins,"She might meet you secretly when she's lonely
And the world you may know may be so heavenly
No she isn't yours you take her tenderly
Oh but I'm not blaming you I'm blaming me

When loneliness stepped in she stepped out on me
And her heart crossed your path mistakenly
I lost her in your arms temporarally
Oh but I'm not blaming you I'm blaming me

I'm blaming me it was I who let her down
I made it easy for you cause I never was around
I keep forgiving her it's not her fault you see
But I'm not blaming you I'm blaming me
But I'm not blaming you I'm blaming me




",I'm Not Blaming You,1971
Marty Robbins,"From the letter you write me I guess that you're doing fine
I suppose you're too busy to remember I'm here doing time
I doubt if you're lonely I doubt if you've cried any tears
I doubt if you do any thinking about me while I'm doing seventeen years

If you could imagine some things that I've had to go through
Perhaps you'd remember I'm doing them all just for you
But you don't see the bars you can't hear that big iron gate
For you'd never forget that you'd never regret that
I'm here doin' time for your sake

You know I love you and that's why I'll never reveal
The reason I'm stuck here you know that my lips are sealed
I doubt if you're lonely I doubt if you've cried any tears
I doubt if you do any thinking about me while I'm doing seventeen years
I doubt if you do any thinking about me while I'm doing seventeen years




",Seventeen Years,1971
Marty Robbins,"At times when it's snowin'
At times when the wind is blowin'
At times when the night is still
At times when the moon has climbed the hill
I can feel you close to me
But when I reach I find you gone
My world is make believe

At times when it's sunny
At times I can hear you call me honey
At times when the sun is overhead
Or at times when I'm cryin' in my bed
I can feel you close to me
But when I reach I find you gone
My world is make believe

At times I can hear you callin'
In the fallin' of the rain
At times in a rainbow
I can see you and hear you
Call my name

At times I can take it
At times I think I'm gonna make it
Oh, at times when I'm feelin' blue
I pretend the angels didn't send for you
And I can feel you close to me
But when I reach I find you gone
My world is make believe

",At Times,1972
Marty Robbins,"Three years ago she left me in the valley
Said, the city life was what she wanted more
She said, life in the valley was to simple
Excitement was what she wanted more

She said, she'd be important in the city
Didn't she know how important she was here
For three years now I watched alone and waited
Somethin' told me that I would see her once again

Today I'm gonna drive down to the station
And I'll pick her up and bring her home at last
So often I've said that I'd forgive her
For anything that's happened in the past

Last week I got a letter from the city
Sayin' they were going to send me what was mine
She's commin' back to stay here in the valley
She's returning in a simple box of pine

I guess I'll take a ride by the river
Even though my heart would break
And I'll give her flowers like I used to give her
We're together once again for old time's sake

Oh, she never was important in the city
Just a girl whose lucky star will never shine
But she's commin' back to stay here in the valley
She's returning in a simple box of pine",The City,1972
Marty Robbins,"Janet, I believe that it's about time that
We stopped to talk things over
There's a lot of things about life
Janet, you're too young to understand
You think life with me is like a field of clover
I can satisfy you now but I won't
Always be this much a man

Janet, there's not too much chance that we're gonna
Make it through this night together
And the reason I'm believin' is there's
More than twenty years between our age
Right now skies are bluer, later on,
Will come the stormy weather
Life is like a book and let me tell ya, Janet
I've read every page

You find satisfaction and contentment just
Lyin' here bein' my embrace
Let me tell you once again, that you'll wake up
Some mornin' and be lookin' in some old and wrinkled face

But I can't make you understand while you're lyin' here
And cryin' like you're cryin' now
And it's hard to think while kissin' you
For no one else can kiss me like you can
And all the time you're tryin' to reassure me
That my youth ain't dyin' now
That I'll never be too old
That I'll always be this much a man

You keep on a-tellin' me that you that don't expect
No more from life than I can give
Janet, I'm just fool enough to try to be that big a fool
If that's the way you think you want to live
Janet, I'm just fool enough to try to be that big a fool
If that's the way you think you want to live

Marty Robbins,"Amor, amor, amor,
This word so sweet that I repeat,
Means I adore you.

Amor, amor, my love,
Would you deny this heart
That I have placed before you?
I can't find another word
With meaning so clear,
My lips try to whisper
Sweeter things in your ear.

But somehow or other,
Nothing sounds quite so dear,
As this soft caressing word I know.

There is no day,
And nights are lonely.

Marty Robbins,"From where I stand I can see all the lights in the city
For one man to love one woman so much it's a pity
From where I stand I can see the cantina she goes to
Where she's not supposed to but goes anyway
From where I stand I can hear the music and laughter
Camelia keeps tellin' me that's all her young heart is after
I see it differently, I see her there with a man
Camelia keeps lyin', I see, from where I stand
If there was one ounce of man left in me I'd accuse her
What's left of a man knows for certain if I do I'll lose her
It wouldn't do to let her know I know she's lyin'
Or that I've been spyin', she'd never come back
Camelia, I almost despise the ground that you walk on
The reason I don't is, it's me not the ground, that you walk on
Constantly tormented knowing you're just partly mine

Marty Robbins,"Past the Gulf Of Mexico is an island where
I lived and loved a long time ago
Disappointed in love I decided to roam
Sad was the day that I sailed far away from my home

Every dream I dream takes me again
To the island down in the Caribbean
Back to happiness and my Spanish Town home
To the brown skinned girl that's causin' me
To be filled with grief and misery
If she takes me back I will never more roam
Brown skinned girl from Spanish town lives in my heart

I've tried to forget her but how do I start
Constantly she's on my mind both night and day
I've known only sorrow since I sailed away
Let the tide and trade winds carry me
To the girl I want to marry me

I can't live alone just on mem'ries I've known
I'm just like a bird that dosen't sing
Like a seagull with a broken wing

Maria Elena can't you see how much I care
To me your voice is like the echo of a sigh,
And when you're near, my heart can speak above a sigh/\.

Maria Elena, take me to your heart

To share this love is really all I ask of you.

What more could I ask

Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.

They'll pass through this world hand in hand,

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.

But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
I can't wait to see the lights of town

Is trembling as never before

The moment she walks through the door.
The lips that have kissed her,
That's loved her and missed her

Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking

The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much.
I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours

I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head.
I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to

Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it
The love that I have for my wife.

When a man's only chance was his own forty-four
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
'Way out in the West with a gun in his hand
At the age of twelve years he did kill his first man

There's Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy, their boy bandit king
'Ere his young manhood has reached his sad end
With a notch an his pistol for twenty one men!
Was on a sad night when poor Billy died
He said to his friend, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men I have put bullets through
Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty two!""

I'll sing you how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shinin', the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The young outlaw's life is now come to an end
There's many a man with a face fine and fair
Who start out in life with a chance to be square
Just like poor Billy they wander astray
They'll lose their lives in the very same way!",Billy the Kid,1976
Marty Robbins,"I'm kin to the rovin' wind that brings the norther in
Along that dusty trail I'll take my stand
The steers are big and bold and the nights are often cold
But I'll get by so long as I can

Throw that rope and brand that calf dream of a girl in a photograph
I got no home I got no wife but I'll be a doggone cowboy all of my life

I'm up at the crack of dawn and I throw the bacon on
Seems somehow my work is never through
When I get done at night all the stars are big and bright
But then that's sorta what you're used to when you

Throw that rope and brand that calf dream of a girl in a photograph
I got no home I got no wife but I'll be a doggone cowboy all of my life

The hot dry wind may blow and you'll see me in the rain and snow
With just an old campfire to keep me warm
I'll move the herd along and I'll greet them with a song
So I guess that I was born

Throw that rope and brand that calf dream of a girl in a photograph
I got no home I got no wife but I'll be a doggone cowboy all of my life

Marty Robbins,"Ninety days since the country's seen a drop of rain
Forty-four since the grass began to burn
Thristy cattle are millin' round the old creek bed

Dusty winds where the waters used to churn
Dusty winds, hear them blow
Dusty winds, moanin' low
Night and day on they go

Those dusty winds
Not a cloud in the sky but still the sun shines dim
But enough to turn the scenery dark and brown
Lookin' Westward is a dust cloud loomin' high in the sky

Shows the trail of fifty settlers leavin' town
Dusty winds, hear them blow
Dusty winds, moanin' low
Night and day on they go

Those dusty winds
When it's late in the evenin', in my cabin all alone
It's so lonesome when that wind comes howlin' through

Marty Robbins,"Down in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
There lived a maiden lovely as a rose
Deep was the love of Lisa, the rose of New Wavo
For Johnny Fedavo and he loved her too
They made a vow that they'd always love each other
For them, on other could be so true

Storm clouds swept in the life of Johnny Fedavo
The promise of Heaven lasted for just a day
God needed someone to brighten his throne
Lisa was taken and Johnny was left all alone

That day in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
Sadly, a village laid their rose away
Johnny came home but no Lisa was there to meet him
No arms to greet him or hold him tight
Johnny prayed alone for God to hear it
To take his spirit away that night

The years passed by and no one saw Johnny Fedavo
The children grew and people were gay once more
One day they found him with hair snowy white
The rose in his hand was his message to Lisa that night

Down in the little Mexican town of New Wavo
Two lovers at last their peace with God have found
Deep was the love of Lisa, the rose of New Wavo
For Johnny Fedavo and he loved her too
There in the chapel shadows they both lay sleeping
Their vows still keeping and both still true



",Johnny Fedavo,1976
Marty Robbins,"Warm are the winds on the desert
A whirlwind is dancing around 
I stop to survey all the beauty that's here 
When a shadow moves out 'cross the ground 

It's an eagle that circles above me 
And he screams to his friends on the hill 
""Stay close together, move not a feather 
Man walks among us, be still, be still 
Man walks among us, be still"" 

Everything hides, but I see them 
I've spotted an old mother quail 
I look close and see, looking right back at me 
The eyes of a young cottontail 
I see a coyote sneaking 
As he crawls through the brush on the hill 
And the eagle screams down, ""Stay close to the ground 
Man walks among us, be still, be still 
Man walks among us, be still."" 

Twenty feet high in the side of a cactus 
I see a hole where the butcher bird stays 
If mortals could choose, and if heaven should ask us 
Here's where I'd want to spend all of my days 

Soon will be gone all the desert 
Cities will cover each hill 
Today will just be a fond memory
Man walks among us, be still, be still 
Man walks among us, be still",Man Walks Among Us,1976
Marty Robbins,"When I was but a young man,I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy went bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living, leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master's call
 
One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started then out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout
 
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name
 
So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground
 
I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When another bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow
 
My wicked past unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason,life is his to take or give 
 
A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade nearly six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried in vain for mercy kneeling there upon the ground
 
A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy seas
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I learned that much and more the night the Saviour called my name",The Master's Call,1976
Marty Robbins,"Old Red was one of the orneriest yet 
I've seen at the big rodeo 
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life 
Old Red had never been rode 

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind 
That blew on the Montana plain 
Old Red was one of the last of his breed 
And wasn't about to be tamed 

From Idaho a young cowboy came 
To ride in the big rodeo 
The young cowboy's name was Billy McClain 
And Billy had never been thrown 

The greatest desire filling young Billy's heart 
To ride this old outlaw called Red 
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say 
""I'll ride him or drop over dead"" 

Old Red was wicked down there in the chute 
He was kicking and stomping about 
Billy climbed in to the saddle with ease 
Then yelled ""Turn him loose, let us out"" 

Old Red came out with his head on the ground 
His back hooves were touching his nose 
Tryin' to get rid of the man on his back 
But the man went wherever he'd go 

Billy was rakin' Old Red with his spurs 
From his tail to the tip of his chin 
He was doin' right well, but Billy could tell 
This outlaw would never give in 

Old Red was runnin' straight for the fence 
Suddenly stoppin' and then 
He reared on his hind legs and fell on his back 
Takin' poor Billy with him 

There was a hush in the crowd and they knew 
This would be Billy's last ride 
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest when they fell 
And under Old Red Billy died 

Old Red lay still, no more would he move 
The cowboys that seen it could tell 
In tryin' to throw Billy off of his back 
Old Red broke his neck when he fell 

Out in the West is the place where they rest 
This cowboy that never was thrown 
And one foot away restin' there 'neath the clay 
Is the outlaw that never was rode",Old Red,1976

How cool are the rivers how soft is the breeze
If it's just like my dreams then I must go and see
For the Red Hills of Utah are calling me

So long I have waited since I was a child
Merely the thought keeps my heart running wild
I've waited so long now it's hard to believe
The Red Hills of Utah at last I will see

How pretty are flowers that bloom in the spring
How sweet are the songs the mockingbirds sing

Marty Robbins,"I rode out of Kansas City, going, south to Mexico
I was, running dodging danger,left the, girl that I loved so
Far behind lay Kansas City and the, past that I had earned
Twenty, notches on my six gun marked the, lessons I had learned

Many times I sold my fast gun for a, place to lay my head
Till the, nights began to haunt me by the, men that I lay dead
Couldn't, stand it any longer with the, life that I'd begun
So I, said good-bye to Jeannie and, became a running gun

I rode into Amarillo as the sun sank in the west
My thoughts in Kansas City and the girl that I love best
As I smiled and kissed her gently and then turned around to go
Said I'd send for her to meet me when I reached old Mexico

I had barely left the saddle and my foot just touched the ground
When a cold voice from the shadows told me not to turn around
Said he new about my fast gun,new the price paid by the law
Challenged by a bounty hunter,so I turned around to draw

I knew someday I'd meet him for his hand like lightning flashed
My own gun stayed in leather as his bullet tore it's path
As my strength was slowly fading,I could see him walk away
And I knew that where I lie today,he to must lie some day

Now my strength is slowly fading and my eyes are growing dim
And my thoughts return to Jeannie
and the home that we had planned
Oh please tell her won't you mister
that she's still the only one
But a woman's love is waisted when she loves a running gun",Running Gun,1976
Marty Robbins,"I was hangin' 'round town, just spendin' my time
Out of a job, not earnin' a dime
A feller steps up and he said, ""I suppose
You're a bronc fighter from looks of your clothes""
""you figures me right, I'm a good one"" I claim
""do you happen to have any bad ones to tame?""
Said ""he's got one, a bad one to buck
At throwin' good riders, he's had lots of luck""

I gets all het up and I ask what he pays
To ride this old nag for a couple of days
He offered me ten; I said, ""I'm your man
A bronc never lived that I couldn't span""
He said: ""get your saddle, I'll give you a chance""
In his buckboard we hopped and he drives to the ranch
I stayed 'til mornin' and right after chuck
I stepped out to see if this outlaw can buck

Down in the horse corral standin' alone
Is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
His legs are all spavined, he's got pigeon toes
Little pig eyes and a big roman nose
Little pin ears that touched at the tip
A big 44 brand was on his left hip
U-necked and old, with a long, lower jaw
I could see with one eye, he's a regular outlaw

I gets the blinds on 'im and it sure is a fright
Next comes the saddle and I screws it down tight
Then I steps on 'im and I raises the blinds
Get outta the way boys, he's gonna unwind
He sure is a frog-walker, he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings, for to be on the fly
He turns his old belly right up to the sun
He sure is a sun-fishin', son-of-a-gun

He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the range
He'll turn on a nickel and give you some change
He hits on all fours and goes up on high
Leaves me a spinnin' up there in the sky
I turns over twice and I comes back to earth
I lights in a cussin' the day of his birth
I know there are ponies that I cannot ride
There's some of them left, they haven't all died

I'll bet all my money, the man ain't alive
That'll stay with old strawberry

Marty Robbins,"A tall handsome stranger rode into town
With fire in his eyes burning red as sundown
His boots were all dusty, his coat open wide
Six ways of dying hung low on his side

He went in the town hall asking for me
They told him that I was still town deputy
I sent him to prison to pay for his crime
He killed a guard on the Sante Fe line

He spread word around town that my time had come
My notch was already carved on his gun
He's laughing and braggin and having his fun
It's all a show for he knows I won't run

That night in silence the town was asleep
I sat by my window and looked down the street
I wished in my heart that he would just ride away
I hated to face him next sunup that day

I met him at sunup, the crowd gathered round
Waitin and watching for one to go down
He grabbed for his six gun, tryin his best
He cursed as my bullet went deep in his chest

He stood there a moment and looked all around
Slowly and lifeless he fell to the ground
The stranger's my brother, born an outlaw
He must have forgotton I taught him to draw

The whole town was waiting and I was alone
The blood that I spilled was just like my own
When she hears this story, how Mother will cry
Brother 'gainst brother and one had to die

To die
To die

Was on a rainy night like this that Flo said we were through.
I told her how I loved her, and I begged her not to go
But another man had changed her mind so I said goodbye to Flo.

Alone within my cell tonight my heart is filled with fear
The only sound within the room is the falling of each tear.
I think about the thing I've done, I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow, but they're hanging me tonight.

That night he came and took my Flo and headed in to town
I knew I had to find this man and try to gun him down
As I walked by a dim cafe and I looked through the door
I saw my Flo with her new love and I couldn't stand no more,
I couldn't stand no more.

I took my pistol from my hip and with a trembling hand
I took the life of pretty Flo and that good for nothin' man
That good for nothin' man!

I think about the thing I've done, I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow, but they're hanging me tonight.

In the valley of the Rio Grande in a garden of roses she said she'd wait for me
To the valley of the Rio Grande I know I must go cause my heart tells me go again
If I stay any longer she may find another to love her
So tonight I must ride for the valley of the Rio Grande
I can see the candle in her window every night she said would brightly burn
I've been travelin' anywhere the wind blows but my heart tells me I must return
To the valley of the Rio Grande

I don't deserve her kiss but I can try
Her smile is pure she does no wrong
But I know deep within myself I'm not that strong
And she says, I will always be the only one
Ah, but she's been cheated
Look what you've done

And your memory is a cloud that hides the sun

I followed you to Utah

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things

I had your child in Memphis
You heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there, so we moved on

And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no gold mine
But this time only two of us move on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone

Marty Robbins,"So quickly time overtakes us
And there's so many things left to do
I've tried to say what I wanted to say
In this song that I've written for you

As I stand here tonight
From the stage I can see
People look back and smile
And my mind quickly flies
To the time that's gone by
And I say every tear's been worthwhile
Some songs I have sung
Hardly pleased anyone
It wasn't cause I never tried
I remember the gloom
Of a cheap little room
Where after a show I have cried
But I thank God above
For sendin' his love
Through people like you I call friends
And it's so good to know
That wherever we go
Some of us might meet again
Life's been worth livin'

So tonight let's pretend
That it never will end
Happiness dosen't last long
And if this night should be
The last night we should meet
Then let's say goodbye with a song

'Cause there's no way to know
When it's our turn to go
Everything's part of life's plan
You have given me love
In return I have love
For every woman and man
Life's been worth livin'

Life's been worth livin'
Worth livin'
Worth livin'

Marty Robbins,"Meet Me Tonight in Laredo Lyrics

She met him one night in Laredo just a wild comanchero they say
They told her that he'd been an outlaw and she'd have to send him away
They warned her of toil and of hardships and a life filled with heartaches and tears
Then one day he sent her a message the one she'd been waiting to hear
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico

The night as they slipped through the darkness
To the trail where their horses were tied
He whispered a prayer for tomorrow that she would be safe by his side
She smiled as they climbed in the saddle and as swift as a wild prairie wind
They rode to the Madre Sierra repeating these words once again
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico.

Now in their own hacienda in the glow of a soft candle light
The hands that once held a sixgun are holding their baby tonight
She echoes his God will go with us and at night when the moon's hanging low
She smiles as she fondly remembers the words he had said long ago
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico

",Meet Me Tonight in Laredo,1980
Marty Robbins,"See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I'm a rovin' cowboy ridin' all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath the prairie moon
I'll ride along and sing a tune

See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

That a new world's born at dawn

Sometimes I find it hard to find the strength
To make it through the day
But I've got a woman who carries me on
She gives me part of her faith
When all of my faith is gone

She's made of faith
She's taller than the mountains
Stronger than the strongest ship that sails the sea
Her faith is strong
Like an overflowing fountain
And when I need it most it overflows on me

She picks me up when life puts me down
Being the woman she is, I know she's strong enough
For me to lean upon
But sometimes it's hard to face a new day
When she looks at me and smiles I know
I've found a way

She's made of faith
She's taller than the mountains
Stronger than the strongest ship that sails the sea
Her faith is strong
Like an overflowing fountain
And when I need it most it overflows on me
And when I need it most it overflows on me

'Cause that leaves me lots of time to live it up
I'm almost late, I really should be goin'
But I guess there's time for just another cup

I see you've rearranged the way the house was
You've added some and took some things away
Could you warm this half-a-cup here that I'm holdin'
I don't have much time, I must be on my way

Well, I've talked so long and all you've done is listened
And that coffee pot's been empty for an hour

I'll stop somewhere and buy some pretty flowers

It's too late to pick up what I came by for
And if I left them, do you really think he'd mind
'Cause like I said, I'm late and she won't like it
I'll drop by and pick them up some other time

When everything in life is up for trade

We could reach back in a storehouse full of love
Now we can't find tomorrow or run back to yesterday

This time there's no tomorrow, oh, we've told them all goodbye
We buried them in this hole we both dug
And we can't retrace our footsteps, yesterday has lost it's light
And this time we've run completely out of love

This time we found a mountain neither one of us can cross
And a valley where the sun don't ever shine
And this time we just can't make it, all the love we had is lost
And we've run completely out of love this time

This time we found a mountain neither one of us can cross

Will fade away with time

Just an occasional rose
I can bear the pain for a while
Even though my heart knows
You'll be thinkin' of him when
We're makin' love, it always shows
I can take the thorns if there's

The road of love is rocky and
Behind the blue sky there's a thousand storms
But a smile or a touch or a love word's
Like a rose among the thorns
When you say you love me
It erases all the worries on my mind
'Cause you'll be with me tonight
For a little while his memory's left behind

Places she's never seen keeps her from settlin' down
Just like a free runnin' river she rambles and rolls
The highway's her heaven, she makes the whole world her own

Sometimes I live with her, sometimes I'm livin' without her
Just when I think that I'm finally beginnin' to tame her

Down to the ocean, she might stay a while on the beach
Then caught by the high tide she drifts further on out of reach
There's no way a-tellin' how soon you may see her again

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

Oh, morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

Cast out our sin and enter in

The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard

A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""

The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate

We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit

Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear

We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate

The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck

And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit

""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down

But the stranger didn't give an inch
He came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the Buckskin
In a Continental Suit

Well, I turned around to look at Jim
And he was watchin' me
He said, ""I don't believe
The crazy things I think I see

But I think I see the outlaw
The one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy
In a Continental Suit""

""The Brute"" came to a stand-still
Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes

The stranger took his money
And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since

The moral of this story:
Never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes
Could be a millionaire

Everybody listen
Don't be fooled by this galoot
This sure-'nough bronc buster

If you don't want me like I am

It's best we live apart 
You go your way and I'll go mine 
We'll both make brand new starts 

There's nothing we can do it seems
We'll never get along

You say I live so wrong
But I can't change my way of life
I've lived it much too long
You'll either take me like I am
Or I'll go on alone

Through misty eyes I saw an angel smiling
In the chapel as he gave her love to me

I, trembling, placed my ring upon her finger
In fond embrace we kissed to seal our love
A hallowed light reflected teardrops falling
As sacred vows were echoed from above

I love you never knowing that you cared for me

That love between us was a card or letter
Or something that you'd send me to make me feel better
A box of candy or a big bouquet
Has made me love you in a special way

A card that shows me tryin' to catch a pretty nurse
Or one with just a name and lovely Bible verse
A telegram, a phone call, made each day complete
And all these things have put me back on my two feet
So here's to you, may all your skies be always blue
And thanks again for helping when I needed you

When you speak do I hear angels sing?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven

I believe you're special, you're no ordinary girl

Mixed with lonely San Francisco raindrops
Frantically I try to find the way to say
What I feel in my heart
As I drive as slowly as I can up
To the ramp that says depart
Pride has closed my lips and I suppose
That I have grown too big to cry
Well, what could be as lonely as a
San Francisco airport kiss goodbye

I wish your plane was late for just an hour
Maybe then my heart could find the power
To say all the things I should have said
Before I let it go this far
I'd go get your bags and take your hand
And walk you back out to the car
It's too late we've reached the gate
That you walk through and disappear from sight
I bet there'll be a lot of lonely
San Francisco teardrops fall tonight

As you raise your head to say goodbye
What's that in the corner of your eye
For do I see a tear begin to form
And slowly trickle down your cheek
I guess you see one too because I'm cryin'
I'm so happy I can't speak
People understand our happiness because
They smile as they walk by
But they don't know the beauty of
A San Francisco teardrop in your eye
No they don't know the beauty of

With a world locked outside I just lay there and cry,

Let me kiss those sweet lips I love best

With his orders to pull old Number Nine.

And the joy in his heart he could not hide
For the whole world was bright as she told him that night
That tomorrow she'd be his blushing bride.

And the black smoke came pouring from the stack
And the headlight a-gleam seemed to brighten his dream
Of tomorrow when he'd be goin' back.

He sped 'round the hill and his brave heart stood still
A headlight was shining in his face
As he whispered a prayer as he threw on the air
For he knew this would be his final race.

In the wreck he was found lying there on the ground
And he asked them to raise his weary head
As his breath slowly went, this message he sent
To the maiden he knew he could not wed

Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry

Loving her gives me the right to miss her like I do
And it gives me a right to be as blue as I want to
I don't want too much of this my heart's about to die
Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry

She walked off and left me with a great big bunch of hurt
And don't you know she walked on me like I was so much dirt
What a lousy way to thank me after how I've tried
Oh don't you think I've got a right to cry




",Don't You Think,
Marty Robbins,"Faith makes me believe behind the darkest cloud
There's a brighter ray of sun
And if today's not quite as good as yesterday
Tomorrow has yet to come
And I believe each time you reach a mountain top
With faith you see below
A green and shaded valley where
A peaceful gentle river flows

But it takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
And it takes faith to face this life

Faith makes me believe for every stormy sea
A peaceful ocean rolls
And I believe for every tree that falls
Another tree will grow
And I believe when faith is used it gives
Us strength to have the things we need
The way the sun will give a rose the strength
It takes to grow up through the weeds

But it takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
It takes faith to climb each mountain
And it takes faith to face this life
It takes faith to face this life

My way of puttin' the bread on the table at home
I'm gettin' back about half as much as I'm givin'
And I couldn't make it without a good woman at home

First place could be just a dream but I'm gonna chase it
Finishing out of the top ten is nothing but bad
And a junker won't ever be first I might as well face it
First class equipment is somethin' a man's got to have

You might even call me a twentieth century drifter
Thirty-two weekends I load up the car and I'm gone
And my woman cries with each goodbye kiss that I give her
And she prayes that come Monday morning and I'll be driftin' home

Well my woman sleeps in my arms and I lie here thinkin'
Half awake half asleep I run and re-run the race
From dark end till dawn it goes on my half awake dreamin'
And ever so often I dream of me taking first place

It's got to be more than a dream dreamin' won't make it
Or dreaming won't ever put bread on the table at home
And racing runs deep in my veins and I'll never shake it
I'm tied to it just like I'm tied to the woman at home

",Two Gun Daddy,
Marty Robbins,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Marty Robbins,"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a-one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky.

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for.

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play deguello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...

Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing and the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

To the thirteen days of glory

I took a trip it was a long time ago
From distant shores the music gently played
And I was hypnotized by a dark skinned girl that danced and whirled
Quickly I knew I was in love with that calypso girl

Dance and whirl calypso girl you could never give your heart
Dance and dine and drink the wine
But someday you will know what makes the lonely teardrops start

She danced in Del Camino Inn each night
And how I longed to kiss and hold her tight
Her sparkling eyes were burning just for me
We celebrated and with kisses warm she led me on
She promised she would wait for me while I was gone

Dance and whirl calypso girl...

The night I left she said she loved me so
And went into another's arms I know
They raised their glass and drank a toast to love
And then she danced for him with eyes that tempt and form that whirls
For no one love could hold the heart of calypso girl

Dance and whirl calypso ...

Back to Jamaica I did go one day
Down to Camino Inn to hear them play
Outside the door was a woman dressed in rags
No one would care to see that beggar woman dance and whirl
It broke my heart to know it was my calypso girl

Come the rains of deep despair

And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid

The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Santa came to say

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Marty Robbins,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Marty Robbins,"Matilda with your calloused hands
Where Will goes you will follow in search of better land

Matilda never mind where you have been
Forget about Missouri forget about your kin

Matilda it's too bad your baby's gone
But he's rested in his cradle by the river
Neath a simple grave of stone

Matilda musn't let Will see you cry
Covered wagons keep on rolling never question or ask why

Matilda work your fingers to the bone
Read your Bible pray the Indians might spare you
Till you and Will reach your new home

Matilda just five hundred miles to go
You know Will's so proud of you though he never tells you so

Marty Robbins,"Once I had a silly notion to out across the ocean
The future for me didn't look to bright
So I signed up with a tanker, 
Got on board and raised the anchor
Stood and watched the Golden Gate fade out of sight
Nineteen days and nights we travelled
Through the stormy seas we battled
'Till we landed in Australia far away
Far from friends and San Francisco
And the Miss I thought I'll miss so
'Till I stepped ashore in Melbourne that first day

But I met Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She let me kiss her then made me miss her 
'Cause Melba could never be mine

So in love but couldn't get her
Cared so much, couldn't forget het
I fell in love just a little bit more and more
There I was just like I started
All alone and broken hearted
I recall the day I left Australia's shore
I was standing there and tryin' 
So hard to keep from crying
The more I tried, the more my tears would show
Then a cold breeze seem to whisper
""it's the end you better kiss her""
So I kissed her and I turned away to go

Then I left Melba from Melbourne
She made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She wouldn't leave there
I couldn't stay there
So Melba could never be mine
",Melba from Melbourne,1996
Marty Robbins,"In this troubled world today
We're asked to lend a hand
Which I will, but first with me
Comes my own native land
Gladly will I help this world
And give all that I can
It isn't selfishness but first
Comes my own native land
Is it right that we should give
And give until it hurts
To a foreign land that treats us
Just like so much dirt
Those who lead us have forgotten
Love is in the soul
Love cannot be purchased with
The promise of more gold
Giving brings a lot of joy
And this I do believe
But aren't the ones who give so much
Entitled to receive
Why do we keep on giving
Is it right that we should please
The very ones who'd like to see
Our country on her knees
If we must give then we should use
A different policy
And give to only those who treat us
Fair and honestly
We give to those who quickly take it
Posing as a friend
Then just as quickly turn and bite
The hand that's feeding them
I'll be accused but I don't feel
I'm acting selfishly
'Cause I believe the country that
Remains strong will stay free
To give is great but are we giving
More than we can stand

Comes my own native land

Made her cry in front of all her friends 
Acted smart, and broke her heart

I remember what I told the crowd 
Let her go, I even yelled it loud 
I talked a lot, and lost a lot 
Once upon a time 

Gone forever, never to return 
Is the love that once so brightly burned 
I remember once upon a time 
How much I used to brag 

Like so many little grains of sand 
I let her slip through my foolish hands 
And before I knew it, love had turned 
From riches back to rags

Was a lady old and gray
I could tell her heart was feelin' sad and low
With a teardrop in her eye
She was tryin' not to cry
I determined then her story I would know

I ventured a word
Then a sad, sad tale I heard
Of a mother who had lost her only child
Yes they've taken her away
These words I heard her say
And they're travellin' on that Southern Dixie Flyer

She was only sweet sixteen
And the only joy I've seen
What God has given now he takes away
She'll be taken home again
On that southbound railroad train
To be laid there with her daddy in the grave

I've no money of my own
I can't even take her home
But I want to be there with my heart's desire
But then she could say no more
As the echo drifted o'er
Was the whistle of that Southern Dixie Flyer

As the train pulled out of sight
And the day became as night
Was a scene to bring a tear to any eye
Just a lady all alone
Not a thing to call her own
But some memories from a better day gone by

I knew right away
There was nothin' I could say
To soothe her heart
Or dry those tear dimmed eyes
So I turned to walk away
From the lady old and gray
Whose heart was on that Southern Dixie Flyer

Marty Robbins,"A long time ago in the small border town of Nogales
There lived a beautiful Mexican girl named Ava Maria Morales
Her dark hair would glisten and shine when touched by the sun
And she loved a cowboy that told her he worked on a ranch just outside of Tucson

Diamonds he gave to her caused many people to say
How could he give her such diamonds as these on thirty a month cowboy pay
She paid no attention to what they said or what they did
Cause she never doubted he worked on a ranch out of Tucson just like he said

Then to Nogales one morning came ridin' a stranger
He wore a badge on the front of his vest the new one in town was a ranger
And he showed some pictures of outlaws and bandits he chased
And one of the pictures caused Ava Maria to turn with fear on her face

Ava Maria it's true what they said
Your cowboy's an outlaw with a price on his head

The ranger left town on the trail of the outlaws he hunted
Ava Maria prayed he'd never catch the cowboy she loved and she wanted
Cause deep in her heart she believed that the ranger was wrong
The outlaw just looked like the cowboy that worked on the ranch just outside of Tucson

True love would never let Ava Maria believe it
And there in her window each evening she'd light a candle and hope he would see it
The years turned her dark hair to silver but love still lived on
She prayed every night for the cowboy that worked on the ranch just outside of Tucson

One night the town of Nogales was saddened to see
The window where Ava Maria would watch was dark where a light used to be
Some love stories live for awhile and then they are gone
For over a century the story of Ava Maria has lived on and on

Ava Maria it's your spirit lives on
I hope you have found him at the ranch just outside of Tucson




",Ava Maria Morales,1996
Marty Robbins,"I rode into Tucson three hours ago for supplies and a short friendly game
Of poker while Smitty put some new shoes on old Dan before he goes lame
I sat in a game at the Miner's Saloon soon I had doubled my stake
The cards run like they'd been dealt by Lady Luck they were just sealin' my fate
A young cowboy lost more than he could afford and accused me of dealin' too smart
His draw was too slow and he fell to the floor with three bullets close to the heart
Oh cottonwood tree are you waiting for me waiting to take me away
I've done no wrong but the town cannot see and so with my life I must pay

A crowd started gatherin' the sheriff came in I handed him over my gun
Was then when I found out the boy I had killed
Was the town's biggest man's only son
I tried to explain I had shot in defense it was the young cowboy or me
The crowd wouldn't listen so they drug me out to the limb of this cottonwood tree
Majestically standing out here all alone it's spring and the valley is green
But I can't admire a place I don't belong to me it's all like a bad dream
But old Dan's beneath me with new shows and all
As they place the noose round my neck
Cowboys I've never laid eyes on before are tyin' my hands to my back
Oh cottonwood tree...

I see hate in the eyes of the town's biggest man as he pulls a branch from the tree
To whip the backside of my old pony Dan so he'll run out from under me
Insane he won't listen to my last appeal a wild grin has covered his face
As I tried to reason just how he would feel if he were up here in my place
There's many a mountain trail I'll never ride green valleys I'll never see
A young cowboy died and a man's foolish pride brought me to this cottonwood tree
My face is turned upward and I cannot breathe the sky's growing dark overhead
The knot's pulling tight as my body swepts free a few moments more I'll be dead
Oh cottonwood tree...




",Cottonwood Tree,1996
Marty Robbins,"The night was ablaze with a heavenly fire of lightnin' wind and rain
And the sound of thunder is spookin' the herd and I fear there'll be a stampede
The cattle are starting to mill around their bellows strike fear in my heart
I know if the storm lasts very much longe there's bound to be a stampede
Stampede cry stampede the thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede

As I sat in the sadle the night's wearing on and the storm is lingering still
The lightning's glare on the restless herd make it seem like a sea's angry swell
Then all of a sudden a bolt of fire strikes the tree where my pony stands
As I fall to the ground I can hear the sound of a drover yellin' stampede
Stampede cry stampede the thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede

For a moment I lay in the mud half dazed I could hear the herd bearin' down
And I crawled in a ditch where a tree came to rest
And I crouched between it and the ground
It seems like a miracle of God's hand it's over and I'm still alive
And I thank the trail boss up in the sky for sparin' me from the stampede
Stampede cry stampede the thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede




",Cry Stampede,1996
Marty Robbins,"When I was a young man beginnin' my teens
How well I remember the lickin's I'd get cause I'd dream
My work never finished, barely begun
I couldn't get started till all of my dreamin' was done

I wouldn't shuck cotton', I wouldn't chop wood
And Pa would whip me and say that's for bein' no good
But I kept chasin' rainbows, finally I found
The great open range and the hills were my best dreamin' ground

When I left the home place our Mother did cry
She begged me to stay there and not say goodbye
My Pa told my Mother, your tears are in vain
Your son is a dreamer and the winds call his name

So don't try to stop him, let him move on
'Cause he won't stop his driftin'
Till all of his dreamin' is gone

Last night in a campfire a face I did see
A vision of Mother, she seemed to be callin' to me
For seventeen years now, I've drifted alone
But I wanna see Mother, tomorrow I start driftin' home

The last hill I've climbed now, and what do I see
An old run down shack where the ranch used to be
Then I see a tombstone and then see one more
I drifted too long from the old ranch house door

There's nothin' more left now but driftin', it seems
But I hope I can dream of the lickin's I'd get
'Cause I'd dream







",The Dreamer,1996
Marty Robbins,"Way out west an Arizona cowboy tends the herd
The dessert lies beneath a sky of blue
Far away, in brightest day, a ghostly sound is heard
The phantom of the rail comes into view

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On his lonely ear is fallin'
Loud and clear, just hear that lonesome wail
But it's just the ghost, the phantom of the rail

Little did he know the train was wrecked in '84
After it had crossed the Great Divide
Every year it tries again to make it just once more
If only to the California Line

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Loud and clear, just hear that lonesome wail
But it's just the ghost, the phantom of the rail

Clickity-clack along the track, it's boiler showin' red
As on it comes along the rusty rails
People that are ridin' in the cars have long been dead
Lost in time along the Phantom Trail

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Is it real to feel the very ground beneath him shake
As on it comes, the only run it ever makes

Cross here comes the phantom, as his eyes in wonder gaze
His pony shys and heads in for the brush
And as it comes upon him terror grips his heart, amazed
Leapin' to avoid it's onward rush

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Thought he saw the engineer, thought he heard him once more wail
As on he went, forever bent, on stayin' on the ghost train rail

Oh dear one how sweet is the memeory
The memory of our parting kiss
I send my heart in this letter
I pray to the one up above
Oh Sarah, don't ever forget me
Stay just as pure as the dove
Oh-oh-oh
I'm like the dove in your window
It's chosen just one mate for life
And you are the one I have chosen
The one that I want for my wife
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh
Sarah refused to believe them
She prayed for Jimmy's return
And there ever night in her window
A small little candle would burn
Years turned her dark hair to silver
She prayed for Jimmy so long
Then one night the village was saddened
The light in her window was gone

Marty Robbins,"On the ranch there's a lonely old bunkhouse
Since all the old timers have gone
To a ranch with a much better bunkhouse
That you hear about only in song 

Where each bunk has a soft feather pillow
There are soft downy rugs on the floor
In the yard there are green weeping willows
And a welcome sign tacked on the door 

Each night in my dreams down the trail I can see
Travis and Bob, and they're waiting for me 

On the ranch there's a lonely old bunkhouse
Since all the old timers have gone

Let me see the mountains over yonder
Give me lots of elbow room but never tie me down
Let me ride and roam and let me wander

Let me ride until I've seen the beauty of it all
Let me sleep out in the cold upon the dampened ground
But never tie me down

How many tears since I've walked by your side Virginia
Too many moonlights have come and gone
Too many sunups and too many sundowns
Too many teardrops and too many roses have died

I'm like I was sad like the day we parted
I'm just the same lonely and still broken hearted
Maybe I'm older but nothing's changed
Love grows no colder I still feel the same
Life has been empty but I've learned to live it Virginia

Oh Virginia when will I stop loving you will it go on forever
Oh Virginia when will these dreams that I dream of you stop maybe never
How many times when your vision appears
I've tried to hold you and you disappeared
And I find the arms that once held you are empty Virginia

Marty Robbins,"The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
A harder ridin' bunch of outlaws no one ever saw
I don't recall the lawman that could match or beat the draw
The rode the west, they fought the best
The never lost a fight
They did their hidin' in the daytime
Ridin' most at night

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
They rode into Yuma on a hot September day
Hit the bank and got the gold and then they rode away
The sheriff tried to stop 'em but he didn't really try
The sheriff thought too much of life
And he didn't wanna die

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
The governor of the territory called the rangers in
The rangers caught the outlaws and the fightin' did begin
For seven hours they fought and there were bodies all around
Not one body of an outlaw lay upon the ground

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
They only took the money that the rich got by their greed
And gave it to the ranchers who were desperately in need
They'd ride into the poorest section of a border town
Evenly distributed to the poorest of the town

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
Maybe it was wrong to steal, but was it wrong to give?
They took many chances so a friend in need might live
One by one they've gone but still there's one alive to tell
The outlaws never failed to hear it when a friend would yell

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')

I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love

So in anger I challenged his right
For the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered
In less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger
Lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood
There in silence
Shocked by the foul evil
Deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind
As I stood there
I had but one chance and
That was to run

Out through the back door
Of Rose's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one
He looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride.
Just as fast as

I could from the West Texas
Town of El Paso
Out through the badlands
Of New Mexico
Back in El Paso
My life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life
Nothing is left

But it's been so long since
I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than
My fear of death.

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart
And at last here

I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rose's Cantina below
My love is strong and it
Pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see
Five mounted cowboys
Off to my left
Ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting
I can't let the catch me
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully 
Wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to
Stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary
Unable to ride
But my love for

Felina is strong and
I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary
I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of
Smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go
Deep in my chest

From out of nowhere

Kissing my cheek as she
Kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving
Arms that I'll die for

Marty Robbins,"All night long I tried to sleep but sleep refused to come
Cause today I knew I'd either have to fight or run
Knowin' if I choose to run my mind would never rest
Cause with so much pride I wear this badge upon my vest

Folks are filled with fear because there's three bad guns in town
Sheriff Olsen made the wrong move and they shot him down
One they called Dakota Jack and one El Paso Red
The other just turned twenty and he's called the Killer Kid

Good advice I get and that's to leave and run away
But my pride and badge I wear won't let me live this way
And if I stay the three have bragged they'll add me to their list
But I have a different aim and I don't aim to miss

From the doorway where I stand I see the outlaws three
Worried none because they know the town's not helpin' me
From a hundred yards away I try a lucky shot
Luck is with me and Dakota Jack dies on the spot

Well a kid runs through the barroom door and Red goes up the stairs
The Kid is ragin' mad, he's breakin' bottles, kickin' chairs
And from a roof El Paso Red has vowed to pay me back
As he views the lifeless body of Dakota Jack

I can see him as he jumps from one roof to the next
Searchin' for me but he has no idea where I'm at
But I watch his every move I'm ready when he leaps
As I shoot him in mid air he crashes to the street

Now there's one against just one I've evened up the score
Down the street I hear a yell come through the barroom door
The Kid has screamed, there's no way I can live unless I run
Said there ain't no lawdog man enough to take his gun

Through the barroom door he walks and steps out on the street
I can't match his draw, he's much too fast for me to beat
And as I walk toward him we both grab a forty-five
Maybe I will die today and he will stay alive

Like a hammer somethin' hits me spinnin' me around
As I fall I shoot him twice before he hits the ground
His bullet missed me , still I feel a burnin' in my chest
His bullet hits the badge I wear with pride upon my vest

As the people view the bodies of the lifeless three
From their looks I know exactly what they think of me
To them I'm just a killer and they could not care less
'Bout my pride or 'bout the badge I wear upon my vest






",Pride and the Badge,1996
Marty Robbins,"Gather 'round cowboys I'll tell you a tale
A story that's hard to be told
Of a trick ridin' cowgril we loved and we called
The queen of the big roder

Wherever she went she was always acclaimed
As the greatest of trick ridin' girls
Perfection and beauty were her's all alone
She was strickly the best in the world

Cowboys and cowgirls remarked of her charm
And a smile that brightened the world
Admired and chosen by many a man
As the best of the trick ridin' girls

One night in Houston the crowd was so big
There was forty-five thousand or more
She had just about finished her act for the night
One more trick the crowd waited for

A dangerous trick at the horse's full speed
A trick that had never been tried
Cowboys and cowgirls both knew if she failed
If she fell she could easily die

The ride was perfection and almost complete
Suddenly somethin' went wrong
The sinch gave away and she lost control
And at full speed she fell to the ground

Not one muscle moved as she lay where she fell
She's unconscious, one bronc buster said
But the doctor removed any doubt from our minds
When he said, the young cowgirl was dead

Not one livin' soul in the crowd made a move
They all knew that somethin' was wrong
As they took her away from the place where she lay
They knew the young cowgirl was gone

Cowboys just stood there with hats in their hands
Their heads were bowed ever so low
Not one eye was dry as we whispered, goodbye
To the queen of the big rodeo

Restless cattle, stop your millin' round

It's time to go to sleep

While I tell you bout some secrets

This poor cowboy has to keep

You won't understand, but still I'd like

To get it off my chest

If I show you what I carry

Will you promise not to laugh?

If another tear drop falls and stains

Her faded photograph

Only you know how I feel inside

Only you know that I weep

Restless cattle, settle down, it's time to sleep.


What's this, you've stopped your millin'

Can it be you understand

That a cowboy cries like any other man?

Guess my story must have touched you cause You're all standin' around

A group of jolly cowboys discussing plans at ease
Said one I'll tell you something, boys, if you will listen, please
I am an old cow puncher and here I'm dressed in rags
I used to be a tough one and go on great big jags

Once I had a home, boys, and a good one you all know
Though I haven't seen it since long long years ago
I'm going back to Dixie once more to see'em all
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

She begged me not to go, boys, for me she would have died

I've broken it that's all
But with God's help I'll see her when the work's all done this fall

When the roundup days are over and the shipping all is done
I'm going right straight home, boys, before my money's gone
I have changed my way, boys, no more will I fall
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

That very night the cowboy went out to stand his guard
The night was dark and cloudy and storming very hard
The cattle they got frightened and rushed in wild stampeed
The cowboy tried to turn them while riding at full speed

While riding in the darkness alone, he did shout
He did his best to head them and turn the herd about
His saddle horse did stumble and on him he did fall
He'll not see his Mother when the work's all done this fall

Boys, send my Mother my wages--the wages I have earned
Cause I am afraid, boys, my last steer I have turned
I'm going to a new range. I hear my Master's call
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

Fred, you take my saddle. Jim, you take my bed
Johnny, take my pistol after I am dead
Think about me kindly as you look upon them all
I'll not see my Mother when the work's all done this fall

Charlie was burried at sunrise. No toombstone at his head
Nothing but a thin board, and this is what it said

But every time I hold you close a fire stops
To think you chosen me to smile upon
I still remember the night that I found you
Other arms embraced you every dance
I stood there watching as they crowded around you
I was sure that I didn't stand the chance
It isn't just the way you said I love you so
The thrill is that it's been for me alone
And as the years go by my love for you will grow
To think you chosen me to be your own
To think you chosen me to be your own",To Think You've Chosen Me,2002

One that brings the memories back again

Safe from other lips that tore it all apart

Where is the moon that used to glow with love
Where are the stars that used to brightly shine
When your love was mine

Where are the dreams that made my life worthwhile
My world is cold without the warmth of your smile
Gone are the vows that were to be for all time
When your love was mine

Darkness and night drove away the light
You left and they came in love vanished with the wind
So here am I, my lonely cry takes me back again
To a time when life was calm
And your love was mine

Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom

Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died

My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door 

The lips that have kissed her, that's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light

I've thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating
The woman I've wanted so much 

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I've put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling, remembering
The way that she tosses her head

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it The love that I have for my wife

Marty Robbins,"Out in New Mexico, many long years ago
There in a shack on the desert, one night in a storm
Amid streaks of lightnin' and loud desert thunder
To a young Mexican couple, a baby was born
Just as the baby cried, thunder and lightnin' died
Moon gave it's light to the world and the stars did the same
Mother and Father, both proud of the daughter
That heaven had sent them, Faleena was this baby's name

When she was seventeen, bothered by crazy dreams
She ran away from the shack and left them to roam
Father and Mother, both asked one another
What made her run away, what made Faleena leave home
Tired of the desert nights, poverty, grief and strife
She ran away late one night in the moon's golden gleam
She didn't know where she'd go, but she'd get there
And she would find happiness, if she would follow her dream

After she ran away, she went to Sante Fe
And in the year that she stayed there, she learned about life
In just a little while, she learned that with a smile
She could have pretty clothes, she could be any man's wife
Rich men romanced her, they dined and they danced her
She understood men and she treated them all just the same
A form that was fine and rare, dark shining glossy hair
Lovely to look at Faleena was this woman's name

Restless in Sante Fe, she had to get away
To any town where the lights had a much brighter glow
One cowboy mentioned the town of El Paso
They never stopped dancin' and money like whiskey did flow
She bought a one-way, a ticket from Sante Fe
Three days and nights on a stage with a rest now and then
She didn't mind that, she knew she would find that
Her new life would be more exciting than where she had been

The stage made it's last stop, up there on the mountain top
To let her see all of the lights at the foot of the hill
Her world was brighter and deep down inside her
An uncontrolled beating, her young heart just wouldn't be still
She got a hotel, a room at the Lily Belle
Quickly she changed to a form-fitting black satin dress
Ev'ry man stopped to stare, at this form fine and rare
Even the women remarked of the charm she possessed

Dancin' and laughter, was what she was after
And Rosa's Cantina had lights, with love in the gleam
That's what she hunted and that's what she wanted
Rosa's was one place, a nice girl would never be seen
It was the same way, it was back in Sante Fe
Men would make fools of themselves at the thought of romance
Rosa took heed of, the place was in need of
This kind of excitement, so she paid Faleena to dance

A year passed and maybe more and then through the swingin' doors
Came a young cowboy so tall and so handsomely dressed
This one was new in town, hadn't been seen around
He was so different, he wasn't like all of the rest
Faleena danced close to him, then threw a rose to him
Quickly he walked to her table and there he sat down
And in a day or so, wherever folks would go
They'd see this young cowboy, showin' Faleena the town

Six weeks he went with her, each minute spent with her
But he was insanely jealous of glances she'd give
Inside he was a-hurtin', from all of her flirtin'
That was her nature and that was the way that she lived
She flirted one night, it started a gun-fight
And after the smoke cleared away, on the floor lay a man
Faleena's young lover, had shot down another
And he had to leave there, so out through the back door he ran

The next day at five o'clock, she heard a rifle shot
Quickly she ran to the door, that was facin' the pass
She saw her cowboy, her wild-ridin' cowboy
Low in the saddle, her cowboy was ridin' in fast
She ran to meet him, to kiss and to greet him
He saw her and motioned her back, with a wave of his hand
Bullets were flyin', Feleena was cryin'
As she saw him fall from the saddle and into the sand

Faleena knelt near him, to hold and to hear him
When she felt the warm blood that flowed from the wound in his side
He raised to kiss her and she heard him whisper
""Never forget me, Faleena it's over, goodbye.""
Quickly she grabbed for, the six-gun that he wore
And screamin' in anger and placin' the gun to her breast
Bury us both deep and maybe we'll find peace
And pullin' the trigger, she fell 'cross the dead cowboy's chest

Out in El Paso, whenever the wind blows
If you listen closely at night, you'll hear in the wind
A woman is cryin', it's not the wind sighin'
Old timer's tell you, Feleena is callin' for him
You'll hear them talkin' and you'll hear them walkin'
You'll hear them laugh and you'll look, but there's no one around
Don't be alarmed, there is really no harm there
It's only the young cowboy, showin' Faleena the town",Faleena (From El Paso),2005

In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a-one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky.

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for.

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play deguello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...

Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing and the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

Marty Robbins,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"",  came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip""

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

Marty Robbins,"Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I ever seen.
Folks down there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene.

I sit alone most every night
Watch them trains roll out of sight
Wish that they were carryin' me
To Abilene, my Abilene.

Crowded city, ain't nothin' free
Nothin' in this town for me
Wish to God that I could be
In Abilene, my Abilene.

How I wish that train would come
Take me back where I come from.
Take me where I want to be
In Abilene, my Abilene.

If I stay here I'll go insane.
Think I need a change of scene

Doing work that never gets done
Hair, that's lost some of the beauty

She's the foundation I lean on

Everyday has been uphill
Oh, we climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged

With love, that strengthens my life

But died when the winter was new

Give her that mansion up yonder

And I brought with me a memory
And I seemed to hear the night winds cry
Go hang your dreams on the hanging tree
Your dreams of love that will never be
Hang your faded dreams on the hanging tree.

I searched for gold, and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
and I wished that I could love her, too
But I left my heart on the hanging tree,
Left my heart with a memory
And my faded dreams on the hanging tree.

Now there were men who craved my gold
And meant to take my gold from me
Where man is gone he needs no gold
So they carried me to the hanging tree
To join my dreams and a memory
Yes, they carried me to the hanging tree.

To really live you must almost die
And it happened just that way with me
They took my gold and set me free
And I walked away from the hanging tree
I walked away from the hanging tree
And my own true love, she walked with me.

That's when I knew that the hanging tree
Is the tree of life, new life for me

The tree of love, new love for me,

A-show 'em how he went, alright

Well, like you said, Marty, he just got to playin' around
A little bit to close to the railroad tracks
Cut about three inches of his tail off, boy, it did hurt
Though I don't know how it would feel but I'm sure it would hurt

He squalled out somethin' like this, he was just a little hound dog right

St. Peter come up to me and he said ""now Marty who do you want to see""
So I began to think
I said ""why don't you call up old Hank Williams and see if he's free""
'Cause Hank saw the world from a Cadillac
And he carried them Lovesick Blues right on his back
Ah yeah

Sure as I was dreaming, sure as I was born
Around my neck came this long skinny arm
And he said, ""Howdy Hoss, my name is Hank, now what brings you here""
So I began to think

I said ""Hank brother, you've seen it all.
You've seen 'em come and go and you've seen 'em rise and fall
And right now country music's got more singers than I believe I've ever seen
So many people got to follow out their dream""
""But I feel different,"" I said, ""'cause I'm a natural born cat
I'm country to the bone, but I don't wear no hat""
Oh no, two three

Said ""I started with Lester back in '72
All I wanted to be was a little different like him and you""
He said ""whoa now, it just takes a little longer to make it if you're different, I guess
But you just sing what's in your heart and God's gonna do the rest
Just be what you are at all times and just tell the folks out there the truth
And that ain't gonna cost you a dime

But if you plan to be different son, you're just rolling the dice
And you know you ain't the first one to pay that price
'Cause there was me and Elvis and there was Bocephus too
There was Waylon and Willie and there was Bill Monroe
And I guess you know about ole Johnny Cash
And I think what the world needs right now is a Jumpin' Jack Flash""

Up in Hillbilly Heaven I saw Keith Whitley, I saw Patsy Cline
I saw Reba McEntire's band, they were all friends of mine
And I began to tremble and I began look
I knew I was dreaming but I just couldn't wake up
Then out of nowhere came this long Cadillac
The driver said ""Now come on there Hank we gotta take you back
Thirty minutes before your next show
We're running behind so we gotta go""
He said ""Marty, I tell you what you do.

You just go on back down there and you make us proud
And remember wherever you go

Marty Stuart,"She was the finest lookin' woman, that I've ever seen
Looked like she stepped right off the cover of a glamour magazine
I've never seen a girl like that, in this country town
The facts are black and white when she threw her arms around me
I went ......... crazy 
We danced the hoochie-coochie, the tide was rollin' in
I was drownin' in a sea of romance
Then she popped the question in the back seat of my car
""If I let you love me would you let me call you, George""

I said, ""Baby, (baby), baby, (baby), baby, (baby)
Well, you can call me George Jetson, call me George Jones
I'll be your Georgie-Porgie, all night long
How was I to know what I was in for
I had it rockin' and a rollin' for a while, by George

By, by, by, by George

We bought a blue refrigerator, satellite and DVDs
A cozy little couch and Motorola TV
She loved to watch those pretty boys with California style
Like a jealous Mickey Rooney, George Clooney drove her wild
And I went ....... crazy

Well she started growin' distant, I felt her discontent
I couldn't make her happy with what I bought or spent
Her heart grew as cold as the air in the Norge
On which she left a note that read, ""Bye George""

And I said, ""Baby, (baby), baby, (baby), baby, (baby)"" yeah
She called me George Jetson, she called me George Jones
I was her Georgie-Porgie, now she's gone

Marty Stuart,"Who'll buy my wheat
Who'll buy my corn
To feed my babies when they're born
Seeds and dirt
A prayer for rain
That I can use
I work the land
I watch the sky
I talk to God and wonder why
But it's the only like I know
These farmer's blues
I see the seasons come and go
Sendin' rain, fire, and snow
I'm at the mercy of it all
This life I choose
Sometimes I hang my head and cry
When that evenin' train goes by
Wish it could take me far away
These farmer's blues

The fence is down
Put on my suit and go to town
Ask for a loan
And I know well
They might refuse
Back at home
Still by my side
The one I love
With worried eyes
Waits for me
To love away

Marty Stuart,"How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had his money, I could do things my way.""
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in Ten with a satisfied mind.

Once I was winning in fortune and fame;
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game.
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime,
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold;
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

When life is over, my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt. 
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time, 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Marty Stuart,"The sign says ""Welcome to Nashville""
From whatever road you've been down
It seems like the first of the milestones
For here is the city, the town

It's a quaint, old mystical city
Where legends and idols have stood
It's a place, where dreams come to harbor
A country boy's Hollywood

But it's lonely at sundown in Nashville
That's when beaten souls start to weep
Each evening at sundown in Nashville
They sweep broken dreams off the street

You'll walk, down 16th to Broadway
Into a world of heartache and pain
Where hillbilly honky tonk angels
Cry out, from the dark side of fame

You'll find, some discarded love songs
And tear stains all over the ground
In a city where dreams get shattered
And swept to the outskirts of town

But it's lonely at sundown in Nashville
That's when beaten souls start to weep
Each evening at sundown in Nashville
They sweep, broken dreams off the street

When God looked down on this whole world
His heart was heavy and sad
The world He'd made and the man He'd loved
Had all turned wicked and bad

As He looked over His creation
He was grieved by His own plan
But just before He destroyed everything He loved
He found Him a righteous man

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to His hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Well God said to Noah
""Build a boat and we'll call it an ark
Build it long, deep and wide
I'm gonna tell you before it starts""

""I'm gonna send to you, a two by two
Every good and living thing
But gather up your family and shut the door
'Cause Brother, it's gonna rain""

For forty days and forty nights
The water came a pourin' down
The tears from God Almighty's eyes
Covered everythin' on the ground

Men were screamin', women were cryin'
Noah heard it day and night
But everything on the other side of that door
Disappeared clean out of sight

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to His hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Alright

And then one day the rain stopped fallin'
And the ark came to a rest
High and dry was ole Brother Noah
On the top of Mount Ararat

Well they opened up the window
And sent the Lord a dove
Well the dove brought back an olive branch
And we all got a bowl of love

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to his hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'

When God looked down on this whole world
His heart was heavy and sad
The world He'd made and the man He'd loved
Had all turned wicked and bad

As He looked over His creation
He was grieved by His own plan
But just before He destroyed everything He loved
He found Him a righteous man

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to His hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Well God said to Noah
""Build a boat and we'll call it an ark
Build it long, deep and wide
I'm gonna tell you before it starts""

""I'm gonna send to you, a two by two
Every good and living thing
But gather up your family and shut the door
'Cause Brother, it's gonna rain""

For forty days and forty nights
The water came a pourin' down
The tears from God Almighty's eyes
Covered everythin' on the ground

Men were screamin', women were cryin'
Noah heard it day and night
But everything on the other side of that door
Disappeared clean out of sight

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to His hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Alright

And then one day the rain stopped fallin'
And the ark came to a rest
High and dry was ole Brother Noah
On the top of Mount Ararat

Well they opened up the window
And sent the Lord a dove
Well the dove brought back an olive branch
And we all got a bowl of love

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to his hand

Looks like a princess in her new dress

The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle

And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry

I know you've heard so many people say
I've got a different girl in every town
But there must be somebody telling lies
And spreading rumours, spreading rumours all around

Because my only joy, is a cuddly toy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

(chorus)

So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
And give me some love

Well I don't pour out my heart like this, to everyone
And anyone that I meet
And I know it ain't the wine 'cause I feel just fine,
Can't you see baby, I'm still on my feet

No, non faccio il playa, non vado manco a Pattaya
Flow soddisfaja, guarda, sto sull'Himalaya
E ho chiamato lei che ha occhi a bomba, Okinawa
Perchè in giro ci stanno troppi occhi radar
Gli occhi su di me, guarda lo straniero
Da criminale è passato a fare il feat con Gué Pequeno
Donne chic e Dompero, io ho sempre un flute pieno
Faccio cin cin, brindo col vostro veleno

Tu guarda tutte queste persone

Vorrebbero bruciassi come il sole

L'odore della notte, le anime corrotte
Il collo pieno d'oro, il cuore pieno d'odio
Gli occhi dei bastardi se ti vedono su un podio
Gli infami che tu servi, il mondo frate a pezzi
E ste sceme fanno i selfie, i fra' rischiano arresti
Tu per cosa moriresti? Vivo e muoio per i fra'
Vivo e muoio per 'sti testi, resto vero street Majestic
Se potessero i falliti che hanno gli occhi su di me
Mi lancerebbero il laser come il tipo degli X-Men
Odiano sta giacca qua da 4K di Balmain
Balenciaga su di un guercio per non far vedere che
Anche io ti guardo infame, sai che non c'entra il Rap
E tua madre è una troia come in Blow con Johnny Depp

Ma non puoi fottermi come un amante
Questi occhi, frate, ne hanno viste tante
Mi fotto questa vita finché tremano le gambe
Fast life, senza fermarmi un attimo
Così non vedo attorno, penso solo a farmi l'attico
Vita maranza, inseguendo il foglio viola, melanza
Tra me e il rap italiano, distanza
Mi stanno sul cazzo come un condom
Tutti tutti vogliono spolparmi come un condor
Tutti i fake e gli ipocriti del mondo
Non li penso con sta Grey e st'idroponica che sfondo
Se vedi nero, eclissi, sotto c'è sempre il sole
La fortuna non esiste, ho solo queste parole
Zero sogni nel cassetto, i fra hanno sogni nel pacchetto

Bruciare stipendi, fra, come Emirati
Siam condannati a bruciare all’inferno, fra, come dannati
Restare bannati dai party privati
Coi vini pregiati e le donne degli altri
E sto tra carogne e carati
Curry su riso basmati, tonni in salsa teriyaki

Se mi stai addosso come un pappataci
Siete Michelle, mica dei maci

E non siete gang, non siete dei maschi
Avete le gonne e vi mancano i tacchi

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Marv Johnson,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

First thought be survival every mornin' when I rise. 
So many murders and homicides in front of my eyes. 
It's just some ballin' ass niggas down to die for the West Side. 
California's the state where all bustas die. 
First thought be survival every mornin' when I rise. 
So many murders and homicides in front of my eyes. 
It's just some ballin'-ass niggas down to die for the West Side. 
 
It could be the napalm, droppin' non stop bombs, 
Armed like vietnam, dominatin' like King Kong. 
Lyrical madness, step up, take up, and start blastin'. 
Wicked as Stephen King when my mental and vocal clashes. 

Syrran wrap, like a boa constrictor, wrappin' ya. 
Up from your feet to your neck, nigga, attackin' ya. 
These 4-5 hollow tips will have you backin' up. 
I only do my dirt at night like dracula. 
 
I'm wanted by the feds, these niggas, they want me dead, 
'Cause I done spread through their territory like the HIV. 
Sun down spots, suckas swallow glocks. 
If they know by these rocks I'm pushin' for the blocks. 

Every corner you past, that show will run him up in his ass. 
Gettin' the cash, while Mr. Bad puts down the smash. 
I dumps quick, my clique be so thick, 
With hi-tech mob shit, crooked as Soviet.

Inflict pain, on any nigger that step in my range. 
Retaliate with hollow tips, blast, and splatter your brain. 
So remain calm, this shit is see-4 bomb, 
Set trip off your motherfuckin' city like 'Nam. 

Best recognize, step up and check eyes. 
Ain't to many busta-ass niggas from the West Side. 
I do or die for mine, livin' life like I'm blind. 
Solo on a flame line, dumpin' hollow tip 9's. 

Survival first, ask questions later. 
Movin' patterns on your bitch-ass 'cause I heard that you was a hater. 
Oh who can save you? 
Defeated your purpose, now you caught up in some deep shit. 

Who got the deepest murder clique, that's some would sick. 
This game is way past wicked. Still I commence to kick it. 
West side niggers stackin' meal tickets.

Lexus, Benz, Beemer, Vet, VIP, 112. 

Might catch me at the Platinum, sippin' on some Hen, rolex down, 
Ride ST 400 Lex through the town. 
Clown, and you'll catch a hot metal tab up to the chest. 
Don't make me kill a nigga out east and head West Side.

Don' push me, I'm too close to the edge

[Killa Tay]
There are so many homies to this game
But will it change got me goinin the same livin the range (?) the brain 
Feelin the pain
Wonderin if ill ever see my G's again
Dependin on god to GLD when I need a friend 
Resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
Pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
Prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse
We livin revalation so I'm headed back to church
Ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons
Officially made no more stressin we infested in funds
I'm still thuggin money can't change me
Still free until I'm six feet deep I rest in piece

Been so long I miss my homies
Been so long I really miss my homies
We keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
Been so long I really miss my homies

[Marvaless]
Rememberin some times
About the old school days
When we was rippin verses 
Strictly for the love of the game
Talent shows were the thang
And all the sessions were packed
You had to raise out the stop if you were weak on the rap
Put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
Servin them all with the dream 
No matter how bad it seemed
Kept our eyes on the prize
Always strivin for more
Raise up in the ghetto
Fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
Half way we be choosin
Missin all my homies restin six feet 
Always keep your name in the streets
Make sure they know how we did it
Until we meet on the other side 
Ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
Til we meet again stya up and tru

These are all a few of my favorite things

But I cannot carry both of the loads

Did your parents ever tell you that you were no good at all

I said I'll take you in my nova, to the tasty freeze

I know all about the dirty mags you keep in the woods

So I asked that guy seshel, I said was it something I said
He said quit being so fuckin' paranoid, it's all in your head

The way she's looking at me, I think she wants me to be,
The guy that always gets shot in every movie you see
Oh god she's walking this way, oh god what should I say,
I hope and pray that she could ever be straight

So I was at a bar the other night and I looked across the room and there's this girl and she walks up to me and she's beautiful and she says 'hey, I'm Katrina, dude, remember me?' and I freaked I said 'oh my god I thought you looked familiar' about this time this 400 fucking pound woman walks up with Katrina's face tattooed on the side of her neck, she comes waddling and says 'don't fuck with my girl' I looked at jabba straight in the fucking eye and say 'don't worry every time I picture Katrina's face it's gonna be on the side of your gross, fat-assed, 3 chinned neck' she says 'are you stupid?'

To wash your troubles away
You always seem to go in there
About twenty time a day

I dropped you off at your therapist
Where you walked across the street
To the neon lights with the purple door
Where you passed out on your feet

Don't think I don't see at all
The beautiful high and the sobering fall begin
It's a kick ass day, wish you were here
Send a postcard telling me when you're here again

There's a lot I could do
If I had my way

Makes me throw up to say
That I even cared at all
I gave a lot and now I'm shot
And shit like that's like sour lemonade

I tried to call your favorite bar
But I got a drunk Australian
He talked a million miles an hour
But I can't tell you what he's saying

And how they watched you piss yourself away
As the glass goes crashing to the floor
From the phone booth, I hear more delay

Let me go
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet I never say goodbye
Let me go
A change of heart a change of mind and heaven fell that night
Let me go 

I tried but could not bring
The best of everything
Too breathless then to wonder
I died a thousand times
Found guilty of no crime

Nighttime I don't need the

The facts of life unspoken
The only game in town

As you scream for more

PRE-CHORUS:
All the souls are dying
While the idiots are trying
To convince you that they're cooler
But they still don't know
They're about to lose control
And they'll be saying now

CHORUS:
Calling radio Tokyo
The lines are down, you're good to go
Now can't you feel
This is real
Calling radio Tokyo
The kids are feeling way too low
They're on their knees
Won't somebody please just bring them home

Get out of the black car
On the sidewalk of the big stars
Of the now and then
Kinda feels a little late

Someone had a bad day
So they sold your soul on Ebay
With an 8 x 10
Autographed in pen

PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS

Seven hours later
They stopped the elevator
To the second floor
And there was no more

CHORUS

Whoa-oa-oa-oa
Yeah!

Marvelous Marvin,"Intro
All the ugly people be quiet!
But before we get this party started right
Hey Cash! [Tell the people what you're the king of]
Verse 1
Just clap your hands, just make your hands clap
To Marvelous the mic marvel, dictator of rap
Get on the dancefloor, let me see what you got
'cause the sound we're throwin' down it makes you want to rock, ha
Hurby Luv supplying the beat
They make my rhymes sound fresher to the highest peak
A-check it out, check it out, get down
A wild style form of rap, my dazzling sound
The style I'm reciting, just reciting my style
The double words, words double but I call it wild
So girl just keep grabbing, keep grabbing my tip
Long as the money's flowin' everything is legit
'cause my rhyme is on time, on time is my rhyme
Already on top, ain't no need to climb
And to the bone, he shocked the record down to the bone
Call him Cash Cash Money but his name is Jerome
The green-eyed brother, brother with the green eyes
He shakes your booty, boom shaker from 9 to 5
So listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet
Verse 2
This is a hard rocker that will rock your house
Turn up your radio and stereo and check it out
It's crazy wild and illy, bang boomin' your butt
My name is Marvin call me Marv the wacky Marvelous nut
The raving rhyme roller, rock roller that rolls
Gettin' laid, stayin' paid so you know that I'm cool
The stunning smashing super, super serious sound
The devastating death defying dictator who's down
The mighty hard rocker who's rocking your butt
And everybody check him out, Cash Money's on the cut
Verse 3
Boy, I'm rough and I'm tough, never pullin' your bluff
I'll turn a hard rock heckler to a cream puff
Got rhymes and rhymes, gettin' better with time
Hit so many def lines you have to rewind
Play it back, listen, observe my rap
'cause my lyrics are strong, and it's like that
In Philly down the way, hard rockin' alone
Marvelous and Cash Money, Marv and Jerome
We make your party hearty and say [La-di-da-di]
Verse 4
Bass boomin', bass boomin' but I'm not done yet
Gonna make it real funky on your def cassette
My mic is sweatin' with steam, when I hear the crowd scream
People, ugly ugly people is the name and the theme
I'm the microphone master, money makin' man
And I got more rock than Bon Jovi's band
Cash constantly controls, corresponds the mix
He's my homey, he's my DJ, he's my sidekick
So as you listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet

Saludando los que encuentro en la vía
Porque el corillo esta en su algarabía
Pero yo sigo en la mía
Pendiente a tu entrada

Tu llegada, quiero ver tu cara
Tu mirada, sentir tu cuerpo
Bailarlo lento es lo que quiero

Estoy ancioso por sentirte cerca de mi
Tratarte bien como te gusta a ti
Poder agarrarte, y contigo partir
Para después lucirnos tu y yo solos

De cualquier modo, esbaratarnos
Estrujarnos, de todo
Tu y yo solos, es lo que quiero
Y me entrego, pero esperar mas no puedo

Te estoy esperando
Y no te veo llegar
Me estoy desesperando
Contigo quiero estar

Ya quiero verte modelando
Quiero tenerte ya
Y aun me sigo preguntando
Cuando el te ira a soltar

Dale, llégale
Que la noche es corta
Y te estoy esperando

Pero, dale, llégale
Que la noche es corta

Estoy aquí, esta la disco encendida
Saludando los que encuentro en la vía
Porque el corillo esta en su algarabía
Pero yo sigo en la mía
Pendiente a tu entrada

Tu llegada, quiero ver tu cara
Tu mirada, sentir tu cuerpo
Bailarlo lento es lo que quiero
Aquí te espero

Estoy ancioso por sentirte cerca de mi
Tratarte bien como te gusta a ti
Poder agarrarte, y contigo partir
Para después lucirnos tu y yo solos

De cualquier modo, esbaratarnos
Estrujarnos, de todo
Tu y yo solos, es lo que quiero
Y me entrego, pero esperar mas no puedo

I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.
 
Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best, 
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.

Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine

Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us

Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, ohh

Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
I'll be feeling fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in

Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate, baby

I need sexual healing
When I get this feeling

And I need sexual healing, darling

Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet

That her smile becomes a smirk,
I go to work.

Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly spoiled

Who would like to sample my supply?

For a trip to paradise?

In their childish way

Every love but true love.

Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me

Marvin Gaye,"You came a long way from St. Louis,
You climbed the ladder of success,
I've seen the town and country cars
That were parked out in front of your fancy address.

You came a long way from St. Louis,
You broke a lotta hearts between,
I've seen a gang of gloomy gals
Who were doing alright till you came on the scene.

You came here from the middle west,
And certainly impressed the population hereabouts.
Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.
So natcherly I got my doubts, you got `em dropping by the wayside,
A feeling I ain't gonna know.

Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine

It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile

Marvin Gaye,"From ages to ages the poets and sages,
Of love glorious love always sing,
But ask any lover and you'll soon discover,
The heartaches that romance can bring,

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Your kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
You're breaking my heart you've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize that you ever cared

Marvin Gaye,"A buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
But the monkey grabbed his neck and said, now, listen, Jack

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in divin', what's the use of jivin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

The buzzard told the monkey, you're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie

Straighten up and stay right

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""



""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""



",Nature Boy,1965
Marvin Gaye,"Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend

Remember anyone can dream
And nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got
Could be a lot if you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,

That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me

That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable [Mono Version],1965
Marvin Gaye,"Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

just suppose I could love you from the very start, maybe
Heaven knows I could show you with an open heart, baby
You're the one that I've been waiting for
In this loneliness forever more

baby, I know you're the one for me

can it be that you're needing me as I need you, honey?
(promise me)
Promise me if we part and I never knew, funny
Deep inside my heart I hope and pray
That someday you'll come to me and say
""baby, I know you're the one for me""

maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

love is strong and I'm betting that it will come my way, gladly
If I'm wrong and mistaken, then I'll have to pay, sadly
No other love could ever be the same
If we fail, there's just yourself to blame

oh baby, I know you're the one for me
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
So lonely
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
All of my life
You're the one for me
I'll never have another love
You're the one for me
For the rest of my life
You're the one for me

Not knowing if I'd see you again

But, oh, baby, welcome home

Feel, feel kinda, kinda, kinda good right now
Feel so good baby, yeah
You've been a long, real long time coming

And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay, baby
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, mm-hmm (I'd be long gone)
Now, hey, hey, hey

I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)

Baby, I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone) mm-hmm
Now, did you hear me?
Well, now, what I say?
Oh, believe me

Well, every woman should try to be whatever her man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you is for you to be true to me

I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend, oh baby (oh, baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldnt be, wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)
Well, I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)

Marvin Gaye,"Oh, one more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like a camel with a heavy pack
One last straw was added
Said it broke the camel's back
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't take it

One more heartache
It would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high
And then let me down
Like the house you built with toothpicks
Stacked upon the kitchen table
One more toothpick tore it down
The foundation was not able
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
No, baby
Oh, believe me

One more heartache
Is too much load
I'm fed up with the heartache
One more and I'll explode
Like a toy balloon that's filled
With as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to break
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
I can't take it
Oh, baby
Don't do it
Oh, honey, ooh, baby",One More Heartache,1967

Darling, please stay, don't go away
(If you leave me)
What a heartache, for heaven's sake
(Don't you need me?)
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
(How could I live?)
Don't be untrue, what could I do?

CHORUS:
(Don't you know you)
You gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

Hey look at me, now can't you see
(Tears in my eyes)
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
(Never leave me)
Why must I plead, you know I need
(All your loving)
Don't put me down, keep me around

(chorus)

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby

Darlin', you give me your joy, am I your toy
(Cracked and broken)
I always share your every care
(Wishin', hopin')
All through the years we have no fears
(Now I'm cryin')
You leave the tears fallin' for years

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby
...and fade











",Pretty Little Baby,1967
Marvin Gaye,"Ooh, you say you're feelin' nervous
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
The one you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love, on this you can rely

And if you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-to-swallow pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

If you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
Baby, if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
Honey, I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)
That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)
Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
Have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
We'll have the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (greatest story that was ever told)

Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just relieve you at the most
But relief is only temporary, pretty soon it'll go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to, there is no overdose

If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
Baby, if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
If you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine, take it, baby",Take This Heart of Mine,1967
