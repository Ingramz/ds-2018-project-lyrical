Eric Clapton,"[Chorus:]
I'm just a bad boy,
Long long ways from home.
I'm just a bad boy,
Long long ways from home.
But I ain't got nobody
To bury me when I'm dead and gone.

Well I'm the cat that scratches
And I'm like a dog that bites.
I'll be your box of matches, baby,
When you need a light.

[Chorus]

I used to have a little girl,
Only 16 years old,
But her mom and dad put me way out,
Way out in the cold.

I can't stay here no longer,
My luck is running slow.
Gotta keep on moving
But I ain't got no place to go.

[Chorus]",Bad Boy,1970

Had the love that would last forever.

Suckas be hatin when they know we makin cash
I don't give a fuck I'm still down and ready to smash
Haters be sayin Warren G fell off
How is that when I put the beach and Snoop on the map
The only way they comin to jack you
You better come right to save case and glocks on site
Ain't know body I know checkin for you
I got gold platinum look at my wrist fool
It's a million and one ways to what people say
They gone say what they say but they fail to display
Where I went wrong, can't I do right
In the city I face snitches, with no britches
Quick to judge and hold a grudge
and all this time I showed them love

Eric Clapton,"Every street is choking
Looks like too much traffic on the road
No fun in driving
You wait in line forever just to go
Heavy roar of engines
Sitting in your prisons on the road

Everybody's rushing
Is it so important to be so
Where's it going to lead to
If all the rushing leads to moving slow
Heavy roar of engines
Sitting in your prisons on the road

Poison from your engine
Merges with the air we've got to breathe
Look at that congestion
Don't it make you want to pack and leave
Thoughts you've been having
Sitting in your prisons on the road

Now you're by my bedside shining empty lights on me

Ringing in my ears resounds through my brain; it finally surrounds me.
There is fire, there is life, there is passion, fever and fury.
There is love and there is hate, there is longing, anger and worry.

Oh, I have a flame; feel it touch my heart.
And down at my core is the hottest part.
I can burn without fuel.

If it should become too cold, I know I can endure the frostbite.

No one then can cause me harm, just as the river runs into the sea.
Cause every day, your fire alarm is deafening the silence all around me.

It is burning.
It is burning.

You can trust me; we can laugh. Together we can share our sorrow.

If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.

If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

She's some kind of demon messing in the glue.

Eric Clapton,"You thought the leaden winter
Would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer
To the violence of the sun

And the colors of the sea
Blind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches
With tales of brave Ulysses

How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To touch their white laced lips

And you see a girl?s brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea

And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
You know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands

With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
Yeah

Run laughing through your fingers
You want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter",Tales of Brave Ulysses,1988

Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves",White Room,1988

Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school

Eric Clapton,"There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways

Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows

And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train",Runaway Train,1998

Then, I projected it six hundred years into the future.

Horror may be upon us within a single century. 

That is, if we refrain 
From blowing ourselves to smithereens in the interval. 
Indeed, unless we choose to decentralize and 
To use applied science, not as the end to which human 
Beings are to be made the means, but as the 
Means to producing a race of free individuals,
We have only two alternatives to choose from, either 

A number of national militarized totalitarianism, 
Having as their root the terror of the atomic 
Bomb and as their consequence the destruction of 
Civilization (or, if the warfare is limited, the 
Perpetuation of militarism) or else one 
Supranational totalitarianism

Called into existence by the 
Social chaos resulting from rapid technological progress in general and 
The atomic revolution in 
Particular, and developing, under the need for efficiency and stability, 
Into the welfare-tyranny of Utopia.

Then the jagged edge appears 
Through the distant clouds of tears. 
I'm like a bridge that was washed away; 
My foundations were made of clay. 

As my soul slides down to die. 
How could I lose him? 
What did I try? 
Bit by bit, I've realized 
That he was here with me; 
I looked into my father's eyes. 
My father's eyes. 
I looked into my father's eyes.

There's every chance he'll go insane.
And someone comes along and takes his hand.
He must have love, can't you understand, that

[Chorus:]
He needs his woman,
He needs his woman,
And he needs his woman,
He needs his woman to love.

His hands are shaking and his head hangs down.
No peace of mind for him is found.
Break his heart and then you'll set him free.
Someone must save him, just you wait and see, but

[Chorus]

What will it take till you believe his love is real? 
Nobody said he had to love you, now he always will.

He'll walk that lonely road again today.
The love he gave you, you threw away.
When all he wanted was a hand to hold.
His lonely world has grown so cold, and

I got to push on through  babe  
And if I take the chance of seeing you again 
I just don't know what I would do  baby 
And sometimes I think I'm gonna be just fine 
All I got to do is go through it  babe. 

Then I hear those voices in the back of my mind  
Telling me over and over and over that I blew it babe. 

You had one chance and you blew it 
You may never get another chance 
You had the floor and you knew it 
You can't blame it on your circumstance 
At the risk of causing you a little pain 
I'm going to have to forget you, babe 
'Cause you broke my heart, left it out in the rain 
And you'd the same again if I let you, babe. 

I would give anything to hold you in my arms 
But you know I can't do that, baby. 

I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made 
Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it.",One Chance,1998
Eric Clapton,"And how do I choose and where do I draw the line
Between truth and necessary pain?
And how do I know and where do I get my belief
That things will be all right again?

What words do I use to try and explain
To those who have witnessed all my tears?
And what does it mean to know all these things
When love's been wasted all these years
When love's been wasted all these years.

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand,
Removed from other people
Who could never understand.

I was a pilgrim for your love,
A pilgrim for your love,
A pilgrim for your love,
I was a pilgrim for your love.

It's like living in a nightmare,
Like looking in the blackest hole,
Like standing on the edge of nothing,
Completely out of control.

Now where have I been all these years
And how come I just couldn't see?
Like a blind man walking 'round in darkness,
I was a pilgrim for your love,
I was a pilgrim for your love.

Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand,
Removed from other people
Who could never understand.

I was a pilgrim for your love,

That I ran from in disgrace

Seven hours seven days or seven years? 

All I know is since you've been gone

And disappear without a trace
A year from now, maybe settle down 
Where no one knows my face

I wish that I could hold you 
One more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run away again

Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here
You'll save me from drowning

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

[Chorus]

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

[Chorus]

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Eric Clapton,"Diamonds of silvery rain in the fountains
And ten-cent red roses from department store counters
Watching the moonlight reflect off the river
Beside where the trains cross the bridge and slow down
Trains with white letters on black iron sides
And white rushing water that all rolls away
And Little Miss Someone does not want to stay
Everyone's moving, with places to go
And Mr Zero - he sadly stands still
As the water goes one way, the train goes another
Mr Zero stands still, and Miss Someone don't bother

Yesterday's kiss will be cold by tomorrow
As campfires of midnight dissolve in the darkness
The room is deserted, the blinds have been drawn
Little Miss Someone has packed up and gone
Fast moving cars disappear down the highway
With signs that say: ""hitch-hikers: do not disturb""
Mr Zero looks quietly up from the curb
Morning has faded, and shadows have grown
And Little Miss Someone is on her way home
Mr Zero stands watching - her plane flies above
And with frost-bitten hands waves goodbye to his love

Walks through the park on a bright summer Sunday
And tapestry kittens that hung on the wall
They all die in the air like a soft minor chord
A vacancy sign, and a bulletin board
Mr Zero is wrapping his jacket around him
Speaking kind words that should have been said long ago
But Little Miss Someone does not want to know
The night is deserted, there's dust on the shelf
Mr Zero sits lonely and talks to himself
It's too late to change, the fine line has been crossed
The charades are all done, Mr Zero has lost",Mr. Zero,2000

Make a man want to jump around and shout.

I said ""I want you to love me.""
She said ""Why man, that'd be great.""

So,
I got long hair but,
She took me back,
Back to see her pad,

Was a big black shiny shotgun,
In the hands of her dad.

Rolling bones 'til the foreman comes back.
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about,
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out.

Everybody's scrambling and running around,
Picking up their money, take the teepee down.

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright",Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,2002

As my soul slides down to die.

Got to run away again,

She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.
And then she asks me, ""Do I look all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight.""

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me.
And then she asks me, ""Do you feel all right?""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes.
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.

So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.

Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Could you tell a wise man,
By the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important,
Than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool,
If for wealth he doesn't strive?

Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Can you condemn a man,
If you're faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin,
Is the colour of his soul?
Could you say that men,
For king and country all must die?

Well, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Eric Clapton,"I´d gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat

I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinking
Let me show you what love means

[Chorus]
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don´t you think it´s time?
Don´t you think it´s time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man

I would give my heart´s desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

[Chorus]

When we stand together
It´s our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Anything, anything
Keep believin´ in the power

This is it, I'll do the best I can
Trust and understand

I could ride to get my whole life straight

Has a toll too much for me to pay

Lights are green all is go 
But my heart keeps telling my mind no

There's a plane over there 
Where all are given even share 
What you get is so small 
It's like never having nothing at all

Eric Clapton,"We went down to the seaside,
One cold frosty morning.
Just to go out for a drive,
For an hour or two.

I walked down to the water,
With my love and our baby.
Watched the waves breaking in,
We're enjoying the view.

Then I heard myself saying,
""We should do this more often,
To watch the little ones playing,
On that bright stony shore.""

And I wished deep down in my heart,
That we could stay here forever.
In these sweet simple moments,
That will come back no more.

When it's 3 o'clock in the morning,
And something scared you from your breast,
I will gently rock you in my arms,
And lay your little head on my chest,

And when you run, from my arms,
Know we'll always find you.
And when you run, out of loving,
And run home to me. (Run home to me)

And the years fly by so quickly,
Like a plane before my eyes,
And you've grown up into a woman,
Before I had time, had time to realize.

And then you'll run, from my arms,
And we'll always come and find you.
And when you run, out of loving,
Then run home to me.

Lord when you run, run out of my arms,
We will always come and find you,
And when you run, out of loving,
Then run home to me. (Run home to me)",Run Home to Me,2005

Still you find the best of me

Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that

Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Will you build and emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

Eric Clapton,"The gangster came to see by boy
When I was working nights to pay one more bill
He promised the kid a sweeter life
Said, ""Gotta understand it's dog eat dog out there""
Well I looked in his room when I got home
And underneath the covers found a loaded gun
He looked at me with empty eyes
He said, ""It's time for me to be moving on""

[Chorus]
Dirty city, this is a dirty town
Where's the pity, I can't move on up to higher ground

I spoke to my woman the other day
She said, ""I need more cash we can't pay our way""
She said, ""Everything gets really hard
And I need something sweet, don't you understand?""
The roar of the train runs by my room
And on these summer nights I can't sleep anymore
I walk in the streets to greet the dawn
Or stay at home all night and stare at the floor

[Chorus: x2]

Help me now
Move on to a higher ground
Help somehow
Make a move to a higher ground
Won't you help somehow

Won't you help somehow

Eric Clapton,"Somebody asked me, why I live the blues
I said the blues is all around me, I just find something I can use
And I feel it running through me, but I give it my heart and soul
I practice while I'm singing, let the feeling take control

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to tell the truth
Every time I sing the blues

Might think about a woman and how she done me wrong
I might think about some hard times when I was barely hanging on
I might think about a brother who still can't make things be
Some falling sisters selling it on the street

[Chorus]

I find my inspiration in tears and desperation
Sad, sad stories we all know so well
Along with one more story to tell

Here I am another night, another town along the way
Room full of people say they wanna hear me play
Yes there was some hard times, my luck cannot survive
It takes a whole lot of living to make us all come alive

What a difference in your day
Seems as though your troubles disappear
Like a feather in your way

Tells you with a smile so sweet
What are little stones you step upon
Just a meadow 'neath your feet
And how you meet the morning
And you gaily swing along
At night you may be weary
But your heart still sings a song
When somebody thinks you're wonderful
Love is mighty close to you
Just another thing more wonderful
Making all her dreams come true
And how you meet the morning
And you gaily swing along
At night you may be weary
But your heart still sings its song

Who wanted a photograph

We will make changes as any family will

The sort of view that seems to want to be seen
And when our kids grow up and leave us
We'll sit and look at that same old view

Eric Clapton,"In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

Truth is in all that I tell

Was getting ready to come around

Don't blame me

And make him think I plant for me

We've got enough for the whole island

Three years now we sell it in town
Under the bucket that goes down
No one knew of it but three:
Mr Grant, Davis and me

Spent all my money, I just did not care.

Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time
Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time,
Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health 'till death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' cry,
I'm not goin' shed no tears
No, I'm not goin' cry,
It's not the time
Cause you're not worth my tears
Well I'm not goin' cry,

When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion

I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

That would carry me away,
And 2 miles to the dusty street,
That I saw you on Today,

It's 4 miles to my lonely room,
Where I will hide my face,
And about a half a mile to the downtown bar,
That I ran from in disgrace,

Lord how long do I have to keep on running,
Seven hours, Seven days or Seven years,
All I know is since you've been gone,
Feels like I'm drowning in a river,

Drowning in a river of tears,
Drowning in a river,
Feels like I'm drowning,
Drowning in a river,

In 3 more days Ill leave this town,
And disappear without a trace,
A year from now maybe settle down,
Where no one knows my face,

I wish that I could hold you,
One more time to ease the pain,
But my times run out and I got to go,
Got to run away again,

Still I catch myself thinking,
One day I'll find my way back here,
You'll save me from drowning,
Drowning in a river,
Drowning in a river of tears,

Eric Dolphy,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1959
Eric Dolphy,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at christopher columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!

Hee, hee, hee!

Ha, ha, ha!

Eric Dolphy,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1961
Eric Dolphy,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

Eric Dolphy,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

Eric Dolphy,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1964
Eric Dolphy,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1995

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1995

And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you

When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Not if one cares

My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
