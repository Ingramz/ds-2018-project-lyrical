Between the Buried and Me,"Reverend, reverend
Is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
An image beneath me
What's within our plans for life?
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery

The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had
Sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your (face)

Well I guess 
You took my youth
I gave it all away
Like the birth of a 
New-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the
Memories now unfold.

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the 
Cemetery Gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last
Through all those
Complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
Left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the Cemetery Gates",Cemetery Gates,2006
Between the Buried and Me,"I don't feel the suns comin' out today
Its staying in, its gonna find another way.
As I sit here in this misery, I don't
Think I'll ever see the sun from here.

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
But that's okay
They're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living 
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever, 
So I want to write my words on the face of today.
And then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and they'll say, 
Hey look at him and where he is these days.
When life is hard, you have to change.",Change,2006
Between the Buried and Me,"I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade, and watch the rolling heads

The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggar's change
And gave it to the rich

The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch
Singing

One more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around
The day I tried to live

Words you say never seem
To live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make never seem
To ever get us anywhere but dead

The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud with
All the other pigs

I woke the same as any other day you know
I should have stayed in bed

The day I tried to win
I wallowed in the blood and mud with
All the other pigs

And I learned that I was a liar
Just like you",The Day I Tried to Live,2006

You help her forget 
The world outside 
You're not part of it yet 
And if you could drive 
You could drive her away

And in your smile 
She could escape there

When things run smooth

Do you know what she means

You will

She wants to smile with your smile 
She wants a nice surprise

Between the Buried and Me,"Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the General sat, and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words

Listen, son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without

For want of the price of tea and a slice

Between the Buried and Me,"My teeth taste funny today...they seem more jagged than normal.
I've been told that I have been grinding them like the gears during my dream hours...
I wonder if it's just my thoughts fusing into one frequent dream...
One which parts with the night.
(There are frequent amongst the walking crawlers).

I saw them dragging the other day.
Scraping their knees and elbows against the bumpy pavement.
Blood tracks have been filling the streets.
Seems the high horse is taking them all home...
I can't leave myself out.
Why should we sleep today...
why should we awake tomorrow?
We can just pop back a few and drift though this pre-programmed flight.

Across all oceans...a windy, noisy trek...
this seems to be what I've needed.
The view used to be better...lands are growing into one.
We wanted it this way. We were brought up to grow into one.
I'm going to fly up soon and seek other lands. The soothing air of flight...
a bird's eye view into what I've always imagined life could be.
Will it be sought after?
It might just be useless writing and ideas that laziness will corrupt in the end.
Bones of dust need hardening. I think the prescription is found.

Sleep on...fly on.
In your mind, you can fly.

My teeth grin oddly today...
they seem to gleam more than normal.
Maybe it will be noticed.
(That's all we ever asked for. Grinning through it all......)

(In the corner the thinker things: I seem more jagged than normal.
I am the episode of constant wandering.
A nomad in my own surroundings...this hand produces the nerve.)

Between the Buried and Me,"The headless lover of three...
An unspeakable affair...

The lady on the hill creates a glorious departure from her everyday life.
Constant swelling of the ankles...A pleasant cry for help...
She began to unfold her story.
A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder.

A perfect crime, that soon lived on. A different life it had to develop...
Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas it grew onto its own.
A much needed surrender.
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed like a lifeless neck...

From a monster to a beauty in quick months...
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom.
It decided it should take advantage of this idea.
(the average traveler hints at this every single day of their lives)

A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body...
A spectacle non-the-less,
Walking proud through life letting its branches guide the way.
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine...

It must be human, for its qualities seem
To outdo even the grandest occupant of the town...
This started to catch the attention of the un-branched...
It had never experienced an affection of this kind...

A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life.
Years went by as it finally found true love...
The love of others...three to be exact.
Letting them into every secret...feeding from every branch...
Every part used for their lives...
(This went on with no negative scents 'til the 5th year came around...)

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal.
The breeze didn't flow like it used to...
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower...
What caused this?
It seen was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem...
Torn to its last life...
How hadn't it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings...
It didn't think anything could go this wrong.

""Comfort...""

It thought life was constant
Happiness if constant happiness was all that was given out.

Between the Buried and Me,"Everywhere I look they are there... what is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
To a place that makes us feel warm... a place that grants us a smile.
Seems like a very simple idea, but not hardly figured out.
(looking everywhere)

I just see faces.
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine.
This routine.
Nothing new... its time to go through with this.
A spaceman. That?s what they say I am. Nothing but a spaceman... always pushing it all away.
Trying to get to that one place I call home.

The journey begins... forcing a new life with the unexplained... a creeping rush that surrounds me.
Floating.... floating away.
Always pushing it all away. Trying to get to that one place I call home.
My own planet... I allowed this wish... unexpected... not knowing why.
Wonder why I question it now? I'm my own planet... not many can experience this sensation.

Loneliness is creeping out... or in, however you think of it.
But it sure is surrounding me. Maybe all the complaining is an accurance of boredom. 
I suppose it?s too late.
I am floating farther and farther away. I did love, I did laugh, I did live.
(Now I?m my own planet)

A spaceman. They say I am? a spaceman.
Planets everywhere... my own destiny? I?m floating towards the sun.
The sun of nothing. Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing. I have become the sun of nothing.
Nothing is here. Memories are not clear.
Floating to the sun? farther away.
I can't believe that?s what it has come to... I never really had it all that bad.
I just looked around and never thought about the blank stares.
(Blank stairs)

They were looking into something much worse than what I thought I was.
Selfishness is a very sticky quality of this species. Looking around...
I don't see any faces... yes I am lonely. It?s to be expected. I?ll sleep now.

I awake to a cold touch. Two arms in four-armed bed. The touch of wind wrapping around me. I'm trying to follow its scent. The scent of isolation. Every door opened, every aspect of our life... gone. Hauling around our memories. Every corner a display of our life. A life I assume will never be the same again. No signs, no clues. A game that I will question until the end. Where have you gone? Was I ever important? The late nights lend ideas, but nothing to gather actual progress.

Years go by. The constant stare. The constant grip inside. Every organ grinding. 
Every day seems easier until I step back in our box. Boxed in. 
Surrounded by life, while suffocating inside a poor version of one. 
Grip the match, set the fire. Don't save a thing.
Rebirth. Reborn. Now this is progress. The black box will reveal only this. I will sit. 
Sit and wait until not a breath escapes my body. Burning in our box. 
What did all of this even mean? More objects to represent a status. 
One we can't even prove. Hide behind what we have taken. 
You have done this. The memory of me will leave with the ash of lost treasures.

Patch the uniform and let the galaxy form a comfortable replacement
We will not be missed

The crossed finger clicking sounds
Inner anxiety with a smile

Yes I like you
I don't love you
I can't love you

Thinking about me

I won't lie dear I'm still breathing

And this town went down like the moon at night
These poor rooftops only go so high
The volume of our bodies is causing the waters to rise

Why do we cry out only when things go wrong?
How would you feel if I only sang sad songs?

The gavel slams the verdict is in
And the jury find you guilty for the things that you did
You're scared for your life, so you turn to the man
The man that holds your life in the palm of his hands.
And your heart starts racing like a bullet from the gun
And you can feel it in your chest, it's affecting your lungs
This breath that you're taking's getting harder to take
Why did it take so long to wake up?

Why do we cry out only when things go wrong?
How would you feel if I only sang sad songs?

Until now
You have been facing
Everything on your own
Up till tonight

Wake up and remember
Where you came from
To get through tonight

Best friends running through the woods and we were acting like we're lost just to get away for
The weekend (just to get away) from the city

We could spend tonight looking back
Or we could try to find all this time spent on barely knowing who we are
A child? like us, is all we need

So here's our chance, 
Our chance to make the change 
To become the type of people that we've
Always wanted to be 
(we're not living by what anybody says, 
Only living by what we've known since we)
We were, we were best friends
And we knew how to get away for the weekend

We could spend tonight looking back
Or we could try to find all this time spent 
On barely knowing who we are
A child, like this, is all we need

I found myself in the forest (in the forest)
I found love in the forest
We just need time to try and find ourselves again
Or just time to breathe

We think we need so many useless things
When all we really need is time to breathe [X2]

But you must admit there's something different
Something more than just a toe to the floor

If standing still and holding on
Give yourself the chance to let go
And make it more

Cold hands in coat pockets
Clinching my daughter's locket

Of her daddy now?

And on and on it goes

Over and over

To where I want to go

Heads for the dresser drawer to
Drive her pain away
Nothing good can come of this.
She opens it there's nothing there
Its only left over tears
Mom and dad had no right she screams
The anger runs down both of her cheeks.

Then she closed her eyes
And found relief in a knife
The blood flows as she cries

All alone the way she feels
Left alone to deal with all the pain-drenched sorrow relief
Bite the lip just forget the bleeding

Wraps His arms around

The deeper I hurt
The deeper you cut
It only gets worse [x2]

Then this is how it has to be
If my pillow's getting wet
I don't see that it matters much to me

Make conversation with the trees
Relieved to leave reality behind me

Bev Kelly,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.

That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You,1960

For falling in love with you.
And, fool that I am,
For thinking you loved me, too.

You took my heart,
Then played the part of little coquette.
And, my dreams just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette.

Fool that I am,
For hoping you'd understand.
And thinking you
Would listen, too,
And, oh, the things I had planned.

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling,
This is goodbye.
But I still care, but I still care,
And oh, fool that I am.
Oh, but I still care,
Fool that I am.",Fool That I Am,1960
Bev Kelly,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Bev Kelly,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",My Ship,1960

Did you ever once ask youself why?
She whispered secrets to me that you made her swear
she would never once speak.

By God! What a beautiful thing to behold.
A scene of submissive perversion.
Complete in devotion. A frozen moment of hell.
Pressurize it and savor the taste.
It lingers. The taste of failure

I drink. Drown.

The whiskey burns away the pain.
A liquid clarity.
Through absolute corruption
I reach a peace inside - I know what's mine.

I never see you anymore, you're absent without leave

In life I learned a lot of things and what it brings to ya
And how it's good to be alone sometimes
I should've known you'd get an itch and you would switch on me
And runaway when day turned into night

'cause you're a good time sister, always out for something better
Just when I need a friend, you're absent without leave
Good time brother, called you friend when I knew better
Ain't got no time to spend, you're absent without leave

So many people that I found say they're down with ya
Then like a ship they sail on with a breeze
See in the sun, they get a touch and it's too much for 'em
They fall around you like the winter leaves

A little rain and they would run for cover (I can still remember)
When no one else could see the need to shelter (How could I forget?)
And knowing better times were round the corner (O I can still remember)
So now when summer skies turn into grey, here's what I say

I never hear I never see you no more (x3)

This deep blue sea I swim in, bears me up enough so I can float away

Lovin' every minute of my life, my life 
Morning came to right the wrong 
Yesterday's another song 
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life

And yet in different ways, nothing ceases to amaze me
I'm a whole new woman, In a different kind a'way 
Yet I remain unfazed my mind and body still un-swayed

Then it ends, love is spurned and then your sanity returns you seething

Are you ready for me?
Better let me know
You'd better, you'd better do whatever's clever baby

How can you be down?
You gotta do whatever's clever
So that I will stick around
You gotta do whatever's clever
And you don't want to waste your time
You gotta do whatever's clever
You gotta go somewhere you gotta do whatever's clever
If you want to step to me
You gotta do whatever's clever
So I'll listen carefully...
You gotta do whatever's clever
You gotta say whatever, hear whatever, mean whatever, hear whatever
Feel whatever, think whatever do whatever's clever

So you want to roll with me
Here's advice that you should heed
Common sense is all you need
To avoid my thunder
First of all talk to my face
Not the view below my waist
How we gonna conversate
While your head's down under?
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can't lose if he steps my way.
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can't lose if he steps my way

[Chorus:]

Here's a very simple truth
""Monkey see is monkey do""
So you're never getting through
If your boys are busters
Finally please understand
All I have is by my hand
On my own I'm making ground
I am my own woman
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can choose if he steps my way.
Stop where are you going
If you were in my shoes, what would you say?
Stop, this is worth knowing
So a brother can't lose if he steps my way

Now you find there ain't a soul you trust, and your vision's all a blur

Sweet baby, don't you cry
Everybody feels the same
Hope gives us reasons why
This is not a losing game

The world is going crazy
Everybody's spinning
Out of sync and out of time
Living in a movie
Waiting for the credits
Don't you know it's real life?
You can't let it phase ya
Trying to find the reasons
When it seems the bad outweighs the good
Until we lose our faith, fall from grace
It's not too late for love

There are times when we reach for the sky, and we tumble down to earth
Still no closer to the finish line, though we've run for all we're worth
We are living in the strangest years, there's so much uncertainty
Seems as though some of our darkest fears have become reality

Sweet baby, don't you cry
See this storm is gonna pass
No matter how it tries
Troubled weather never lasts

The world is going crazy
Everybody's spinning
Out of sync and out of time

Beverley Knight,"Do you remember
There was once a young woman
And she had loved you like no other before
When you were together
You were the heart and soul of the party

Now them days is over
Them times, them times are no more
Though you're gone I can still feel your presence
Least I think that's the way it should be
So wherever you are take a minute
Remember me, remember me

Sometimes it feels like I'm left in this darkness
God called your number and then he just turned out the light
Heaven embraced you and I know, I know that you're happy
But, oh I miss you, I miss, I miss you and I cry for you every night

Well, one day we will be reunited
Least I hope that is our destiny
So while you chill in the arms of angels
Remember me, remember me

Get up, ride, sit back
Who's dangerous
Get up, pow, you foul
Can't hang wid this
Get up, now, gun blast
It's a Conflict
Get up, ride, sit back
Who's dangerous

Verse 1: WildStyle

It's time to get up and hit the hay
Wid the high ass hay song
Betta come and get some
Drop the top up in and
Cock the glock and peel
Rolling through the teal
What it feel?
And if I slip
Ya betta come equipped
Listen to the whips
And the gunshot rips
I really don't give a damn how you feel
I kill if I gotta do it
Down and to the ground I nail
When it's time to mack, them freaks,
I gotta strap up wid Jimmy, uhh,
When I get it wid a girl and the dough
It's a rodeo show from the back wid the Carlos
When I gon' slang them thangs
They write the word the word is flict
Tricks wid style it's WildStyle
I'm pissed, you think you can throw
Now fool you wish, rodeo we on me, lay back
Taking all you bunk punks wid the quickness
You supposed to be a playa
But you running at the mouth
Shoulda mind your business
Come and get it try to get it
Rougher than the necks
I break necks on somebody want to flex
Then let's flex and get it off your chest
The wild west, yes, flict

Hook

Verse 2: Cold Hard

It's the wicked wild west,
Winchester for your chest
Or your man people just can't understand
That I'm a hoodlum that's rawwed up
When I close-in slowly posing if you snooze
Then you losing ya whole damn crew
Those scoundrels got a round for 'em
If ya mama want drama
I'ma bump her in too
Buck, snap, load 'em up roll out
HEAD FOR THE HILLS NOW!
Stuck, trapped, bottle up no clout
Death for real pow
Never could ya get it
Wid a renegade desperado,
Plenty ammo flowing like a fountain
I be coming round the mountain,
Gunning, nigga done in
Ya best ta giddy up
When ya hear them horsies troddin'
At full riding, and ya climbing
And someone shotting
Much trouble passing on the barnyard
Go 'head and bounce and let it go
I'm sick a these soft party cliks want to flow
It's the real rodeo kicking the flow
So hoe on the ride
Can ya giddy up hoe?

Hook

Verse 3: Kilo

Thinking I won't bust you
Don't luck your punk
Glad ta get your body stunk
As I creep wid a rowdy clik
Ta ease ya feet and pop the trunk
Man I hate ta do this shit
Cause it was my melody
Thought that I called him a bitch
So I up my barrel-why
Didn't have ta hit ya for the homicide
That's why he died nobody cried
He shouldn'ta tried
Holla flict and ride
Meet you in your next life
Get on you square get high tonight
Cause last night when he been here
Now he want to know why he didn't ride
A pocket knife or even flict
Boing boing ya see me dong floing
Giddy up now watch me get thoing
Get ya ass fast I'ma last
Demonstrate, pass we crash
Face to face and my nigga
Gohilian mixed beast type nigga
Dangerous to the world
Giddy up now what you figure nigga

Hook

Verse 4: Never

Everybody giddy up
Drum down on your money
Do you want to put um up now, shit

All a bag a funk
And go coast to coast and GET UP
Crucial Conflcit got 'em on cloud nine
Doing hard time
In the state a mind of a, killa
Niggas act like I won't pull
Tha block block blam
Boogie woogie shake it to the left man
Back to the right man
Making the tightest song
Gone again, drinking on gin
Smoking on hay getting in my zone
Riding slick been on the block a bit
Put on the good old Final Tic
see-H-I-see-A-G-O giddy up
While we kick that rodeo
Back to back we gonna smoke on
And toke a sack and tack the proke on
I was born to get up and put 'em in flight
Never say never cause never'll do
And make 'em all giddy up tonight
Side to side let's ride and roll
Ya can't control ya self no more
So come on ya gone
Got 'em all dropping
And leave 'em hopping
To the hip old west

And make, make the people walk into the fire
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame

They don't even write them now is that absurd
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart

Beverley Staunton,"Another morning, another motel bed, 
Another city waitin’ up ahead
Light another menthol, to clear my mind

Of those memories I pretend to forget, 
Cause I always want to live with out regrets 
But, yeah
I still think of her from time to time 
Only she’s still livin’ across the Harlan County Line

Now when we met we were both livin’ far from home
Tryin’ to get by and tired of being alone,
For a moment I thought she was mine
Cause she had a voice I just wanted to believe
She said her mother was full blood Cherokee and her
Daddy was a union man down in the mines…
Fighting the good fight across the Harlan County Line

People can be Noble, and People can be Cruel 
They’ll make you President or they’ll make you a Fool but, 
She always treated me nice and kind
Until that day she left me on my own said there 
Was trouble she had to handle back home
Then she gave me a number and said call any time
If I ever made it across the Harlan County Line

Now the years disappear out on the highway 
And I lost her number somewhere along the way
So I’ll say a little prayer that she’s doing fine

Another morning, another motel bed, 
Another city waitin’ up ahead 
And another small memory to leave behind 
Somewhere across the Harlan County line

Right off the inner state, that's right

and act so rough but darlin', you can't hide the heartache
And the sadness that's buried deep inside

Beverly Derby,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love,2006

They showed Me things I'd never seen
And I've inherited their Kingdom wide

I am the Demon that controls all pain
I kill for one reason, your blood shall rain
Here in My Castle I torment your soul
To make you suffer, that is My goal

I am Born of Flames
To rule in Hell
Born of Flames
Your soul you'll sell

As your Blood stains the wall
And you might think you are Dead
I will awake you in this Torturehall
And just laugh and piss on your head

I'll make you suffer, I'll make you cry
But soon you will like it, do you know why?
Come on Bitch, you sacred whore
When I've stopped penetrating you'll beg for more

Because I am the Demon that controls all pain
I kill for one reason, your blood shall rain
Here in My Castle I torment your soul
To make you suffer, that is My goal

I am Born of Flames
To rule in Hell
Born of Flames
Your soul you'll sell
I am Born in Hell

Bewitched,"Juse one among the nuns yet
She's possessed by Demonic Forces
Before their journey to paradise
She'll change the heavenly courses

In daylight she's what the chirstians adore
After midnight she's a pure holy whore

Seducing their foolish minds
With intentions evil made
Whispering words from Hell
And angels in thousand slayed
With her poision in your Flesh
The virginity you're betrayed
As she suck your lst Blood
Flames of life she'll put to fade

After she's had her way
Ripped to Death they lay
Never to see the light of day
After she's had her way

Sexual Masochistic fucking Torture
The desires she's living for
Always in Hunt for more
She's the Morbid Holy Whore

...Our way to god...

Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry--only worry is him
She'd do anything necessary for him
And I'd do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yup

[Chorus]

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life

Remember the first day when you smiled at me
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house
Remember the first day when you took me out
We had butterflies, although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night

The way we held each others hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
And when he stares at me
You see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

Remember the first day, the first day we kissed
Remember the first day we had an argument
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games
Remember the first day you fell in love with me
It felt so good for you to say those words
'Cause I felt the same way too

The way we held each others hands
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
And I knew right then and there you were the one

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
And when he stares at me
You see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life and baby
Now that you're a part of me you've shown me
Shown me the true meaning of love (the true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
And when he stares at me
You see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts

Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry--only worry is him
She'd do anything necessary for him
And I'd do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yup

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

Walking up to me like they know me

You don't know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man
I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

When we fell in love, it was the summertime 
Heaven shined on us; it was the summertime 
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime

Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old wit'cha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you
A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

Welcome! Welcome!

Bienvenue là où l'fort tue le faible, où la faim tue de fait
Où la société t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite
Où les dettes cumulent, où l'crédit accule, des tas d'foyers
Où les hommes en perte d'idéaux, jurent qu'par les putes dévoyées en vidéo
Chaque soir c'est la fête, les salons cossus attirent les fesses
Sur les gros caïds, qui arrosent les guéridons de pure cocaïne
Ici, les gosses rêvent d'êt'Pirès, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent
Nombreux sont ceux qui dès 13 ans connaissent leur première ivresse
Bienvenue là où l'air pollué, par les pots d'échappement déclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Toluène
Les vices connus gênent la machine de l'état, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en état, peu passent les menottes en métal, on en est là
Ici 300 blindés font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramènent toutes leure p'tites gueules, quand mille meurent fauchés dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, après le 11 septembre on évoque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde à haute voix
Où les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mômes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre à part ces connards en taule ?
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fantômes, un hymne sanguinaire, on entonne
Partout on sent la peur d'un peuple passé au pantone
L'hiver mange l'été, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne
Crie plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont égaré quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde

Welcome to a place where people lie to your face just to get it done
Welcome to the human race, if you ain't got money, you'll pay with pain
Welcome to this world of ours and if you had the chance would you come back again?

We have to believe that we belong
We can't forget where we came from
We came from love

Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tantôt l'un tantôt l'autre
Ange et démon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent
Où l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement lorsqu'elle frappe à nos portes
Où la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup d’surin dans l'aorte
Où tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on t’le dit qu'20 ans après
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils l’diront jamais
Où on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon et ce avant qu'il meure
Puis on s’vante de l’connaître achetant ses tableaux, visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde où on se dit tous égaux, blague à part
Là c’est l'caniveau, là-haut c'est les bureaux, mais l’mieux c'est au milieu
Où on se sait si fragile qu'on prévoit les pièces d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achètera des jambes en famille le dimanche
Où tout le monde ne mange pas à sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Créer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne à ses fins
La misère comme moyen où le supposé mort esclavage sévit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois! Il y a toujours des grains d’poussière vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas à Gattaca mais presque où seul l'élu évite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse s’manifeste
Où on parle de présélection, d'amélioration, de transformation
Génétique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de supers soldats de plomb?
Où on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
Où on entend l’mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envolée la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'préfèrerais qu'tu l’découvres
Allez petit! Lance toi t'inquiète vas-y fonce! Moi, j'te couvre

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man

Everybody's got a fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
And Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""

You give me fever
With your kisses
A fever with a flame in you

Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah, a burn pursues

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him 
She said, ""daddy, oh, don't you dare""

He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight

Fever
I'm his Mrs.
And, daddy, won't you treat him right?

Now that you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give ya fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade 

They give ya fever
When ya kiss 'em
And fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Fever 
Till ya sizzle

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Benz and the house off the coast (if I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the VVS stones (if I let you go)
Coupes in the 'Bach Carter rolls (if I let you go)
She go profit everything I taught (if I let you go)
I can't let you go, damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel, when I know what I know
And my female intuition, telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames, I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations, what you mean you gon' choke? (oh)

You can't stay, you gotta go (oh)
Ain't no other chick spendin' yo' dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would have saw

I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on (oh)

He's so arrogant and bold (oh)
But she gone love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you (ooh)
Why would you risk it baby is that the price I that pay? (Ooh)
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me 
And not see all the things (see all the things, see all the things)

Welcome! Welcome!

Bienvenue là où l'fort tue le faible, où la faim tue de fait
Où la société t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite
Où les dettes cumulent, où l'crédit accule, des tas d'foyers
Où les hommes en perte d'idéaux, jurent qu'par les putes dévoyées en vidéo
Chaque soir c'est la fête, les salons cossus attirent les fesses
Sur les gros caïds, qui arrosent les guéridons de pure cocaïne
Ici, les gosses rêvent d'êt'Pirès, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent
Nombreux sont ceux qui dès 13 ans connaissent leur première ivresse
Bienvenue là où l'air pollué, par les pots d'échappement déclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Toluène
Les vices connus gênent la machine de l'état, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en état, peu passent les menottes en métal, on en est là
Ici 300 blindés font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramènent toutes leure p'tites gueules, quand mille meurent fauchés dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, après le 11 septembre on évoque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde à haute voix
Où les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mômes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre à part ces connards en taule ?
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fantômes, un hymne sanguinaire, on entonne
Partout on sent la peur d'un peuple passé au pantone
L'hiver mange l'été, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne
Crie plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont égaré quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde

Welcome to a place where people lie to your face just to get it done
Welcome to the human race, if you ain't got money, you'll pay with pain
Welcome to this world of ours and if you had the chance would you come back again?
Cuz now you're here, ain't no turning back, got tears in your eyes, a monkey on your back
We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
We can't forget where we came from
We came from love

Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tantôt l'un tantôt l'autre
Ange et démon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent
Où l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement lorsqu'elle frappe à nos portes
Où la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup d’surin dans l'aorte
Où tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on t’le dit qu'20 ans après
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils l’diront jamais
Où on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon et ce avant qu'il meure
Puis on s’vante de l’connaître achetant ses tableaux, visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde où on se dit tous égaux, blague à part
Là c’est l'caniveau, là-haut c'est les bureaux, mais l’mieux c'est au milieu
Où on se sait si fragile qu'on prévoit les pièces d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achètera des jambes en famille le dimanche
Où tout le monde ne mange pas à sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Créer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne à ses fins
La misère comme moyen où le supposé mort esclavage sévit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois! Il y a toujours des grains d’poussière vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas à Gattaca mais presque où seul l'élu évite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse s’manifeste
Où on parle de présélection, d'amélioration, de transformation
Génétique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de supers soldats de plomb?
Où on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
Où on entend l’mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envolée la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'préfèrerais qu'tu l’découvres
Allez petit! Lance toi t'inquiète vas-y fonce! Moi, j'te couvre

Throwin 'a shot down, tryin' to stay above

Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin' a cut

Reminesin' on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin', no V's with hot systems
Missin' my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies

On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?

She said ""Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye""
I was too deep for you from day one
That's why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

[Chorus]
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail

Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much

So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll

Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

[Chorus]
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done",Wishing on a Star [Remix],2005

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat, and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birken Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you; helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

Almost called your name

Is he the best ever? That's the argument
I don't make the list; don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my, oh

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu

Get on the next plane; I don't care

And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you, you?
I know you're probably thinking ""what's up with B?""
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying, can't stop crying
You could have told me that you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me

A melody I start but can't complete

Its only beginning to find release

Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own

Beyoncé,"It ain't for everybody
Welcome to Hollywood, baby
Take my picture
You comin' with?
Let's not even talk about it
Let's do it
Let's go

I see your jealousy as you're watching (I see you watching)
You're watching (It's all good)
It's kinda sexy to me (I love it)
How you're watching, you're watching
I see your face (I see your face)
You want to touch it (You want to touch it)
Come to my place (Come to the crib)
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be (Tonight you goin' be a superstar, baby)
A superstar
Come, let me sign you up (Let's get into it)

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh, c'mon)

Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high rise
I hide behind my shades because the fame is blindin' my eyes
My god, I know how Ozzy Oz must have felt when he was Oz hot
As I have got, I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those 'cause if they had love for you into strangers
When the fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when a train departs
Stranger things have happened
Rappin', stackin' platinum plaques
Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan
Goin' back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than Juventus
Then it's time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted, it's goin' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you stand when the music stop spinnin'

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh, c'mon)

You got to get it
Do you want it?
But you don't need it
Till you do, till you do

Hey mister, page sixer
A-lister, you're in the midst of
The ride of your life, but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating ain't it?
Try not to get jaded
Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' to feel like buzz to ya
Don't lie, go on fly, you're addicted to the light
Without the fame, how you gon' survive?
It's like bein' on heroin, you so high

And everybody's warning you about it (I tried to tell you)
And once you taste it you can't live without it (It's addicting)
Not 'cause you choose to not live without it (you sure you want this, baby?)
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
And everybody's warning you about it
And once you taste it you can't leave

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh, c'mon)

Wanna be seen now, groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
James Dean, John Belushi, blow your whole life trying to live in the lights
Heroin's following, Marijuana hopping over the edge
It's like Janis Joplin
River Pheonix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by Hollywood
Thank God for Hollywood
Hollywood
You sure you want this, baby?
Hollywood, it's the most addicting drug in the world
You want the fame
You want the lights",Hollywood,2006

Come harder; this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself; trust me, you need me

That makes the diamond really shine
And you already is a star

Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

It isn't hard to find

But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind

Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone to say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover, I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know, I know

When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity, tell me, where else can I turn?
When you're the one that I depend upon

Come find this buried treasure

I'm lost in this dream; I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely

And I can't find my way; won't you lead me home?

Bienvenue là où l'fort tue le faible, où la faim tue de fait
Où la société t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite
Où les dettes cumulent, où l'crédit accule, des tas d'foyers
Où les hommes en perte d'idéaux, jurent qu'par les putes dévoyées en vidéo
Chaque soir c'est la fête, les salons cossus attirent les fesses
Sur les gros caïds, qui arrosent les guéridons de pure cocaïne
Ici, les gosses rêvent d'êt'Pirès, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent
Nombreux sont ceux qui dès 13 ans connaissent leur première ivresse
Bienvenue là où l'air pollué, par les pots d'échappement déclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Toluène
Les vices connus gênent la machine de l'état, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en état, peu passent les menottes en métal, on en est là
Ici 300 blindés font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramènent toutes leure p'tites gueules, quand mille meurent fauchés dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, après le 11 septembre on évoque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde à haute voix
Où les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mômes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre à part ces connards en taule ?
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fantômes, un hymne sanguinaire, on entonne
Partout on sent la peur d'un peuple passé au pantone
L'hiver mange l'été, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne
Crie plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont égaré quelque part leur sonotone

Ange et démon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent
Où l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement lorsqu'elle frappe à nos portes
Où la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup d’surin dans l'aorte
Où tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on t’le dit qu'20 ans après
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils l’diront jamais
Où on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon et ce avant qu'il meure
Puis on s’vante de l’connaître achetant ses tableaux, visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde où on se dit tous égaux, blague à part
Là c’est l'caniveau, là-haut c'est les bureaux, mais l’mieux c'est au milieu
Où on se sait si fragile qu'on prévoit les pièces d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achètera des jambes en famille le dimanche
Où tout le monde ne mange pas à sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Créer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne à ses fins
La misère comme moyen où le supposé mort esclavage sévit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois! Il y a toujours des grains d’poussière vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas à Gattaca mais presque où seul l'élu évite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse s’manifeste
Où on parle de présélection, d'amélioration, de transformation
Génétique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de supers soldats de plomb?
Où on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
Où on entend l’mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envolée la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'préfèrerais qu'tu l’découvres
Allez petit! Lance toi t'inquiète vas-y fonce! Moi, j'te couvre

I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't got to be afraid; my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl

I’m in a speedboat in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection’s so cruise
I might walk in Nobu wit' no shoes
""He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you""
Immature adult, insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete, that’s your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that’s your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty, but she couldn’t drop that ass low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money, cops don’t let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell em I said, ""Hello""
Ask if I’ma be there soon and tell him I said, “Hell no”
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
But I don’t, no matter how good it gets, it’ll never be like for
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it’s loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it’s going down right now
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up

'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip’s on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barney's
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder ‘Ye
Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

Now go get my throne cause I don’t wanna stop
I just go in my zone and I’ma make it hot 'til it’s time to go
When it’s time to go, where you trying to go?
You better act like you can see me now

Exactly, Rosewood

I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D!

Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious

When I told my ex I loved her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
""Be successful,"" that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe

Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Uh, ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like? 'Ye protégé
Nah, nah, he sound like he a pro to me
""I know Kanye a jerk,"" how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos

Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain

I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

Me and my boo and my boo boo riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man show you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show

To show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe 
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about 
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

Let her know you sympathize

Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind. gotta take your time

I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm torn
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive

Posted in the back with my things on my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin' babe

And tell me how it's lookin babe, and tell me how it's lookin' babe
Lookin' babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say speed it up I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on them mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rollin' off your tongue
'Cause when you want a smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Driver roll up the partition please
Driver roll up the partition please
I don't need you seeing 'Yonce on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He bucked all my buttons, he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinski'd all on my gown

Oh there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh baby, baby we slow it down
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

Driver roll up the partition fast
Driver roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, talk that trash
Chauffer eavesdropping trying not to crash

Talking 'bout you be repping that verb, wanna see all that s*** I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, f***ed up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, ""Eat the cake, Annie Mae!""

""You can have ambition

Because I am female

Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights

I'm grubbing on the rope, grubbing if you scared, call that ribbon
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
I'm on the Cognac, gangster wife
Newer sheets, he'd swear that I like washed rags, he wet up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm sinking on the mic 'til my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

Talking 'bout you be reppin' that verb, wanna see all that shit I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site

I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I’m a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now bitches I run this

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)

I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)

They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk 'cause I ain’t pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I’m goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, it's 'bout time I show it

I’m a grown woman (I’m a grown woman)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)
I’m a grown woman (I’m a grown woman)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)

I can be bad if I want
I can fire what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I’m a grown woman
I do whatever I want

I'm a grown woman, then I know that I got it (got it , got it)
I'm a grown woman, I got the world in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really wanna know if you got it like that
'Cause you got a cute face and a booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, will get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever she like

My parents who I love
I love you Houston

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm touring
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive

So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me

I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine

Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
'Yonce fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat

I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow

Said what up to his bestest

What's in your head it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down

Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says
Thinner is better

Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Ain't no doctor or therapeutic that can take the pain away
The pain's inside
And nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
And you break when the paper signs you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror
And the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself
It's just a way to masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself
Are you happy with yourself

Yes mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like
You can touch me baby
Do you
Do you wanna touch me baby
Grab ahold, don't let go
Let me know
That you
Ready

I just wanna show you now
Slow it down
Go around
You rock hard
I rock steady

And rock right up to the
Side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak babe, the peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep baby, the deep baby, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Lemme put it in your face
By the way
If you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls

So rock right up to
The side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak babe, the peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep baby, your deep baby, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, me

Hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
Rock hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
Don't you know that I give you
The loving if you need it
I give you my word
You can believe it
Your love feels like
All four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming
My love, your love lifting
Higher harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it baby, rock it baby 'til the water falls down
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now
Yes lord
Damn baby
Driving me cray
Cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me

Daddy what you're going to do with all of this
Ass
All up in your face
Yeah, hell yeah
Love me so deep
Ooh my shit's so good it ain't even right

Hell yeah you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy

We're so much more than pointless fixtures

Beyoncé,"When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would move on
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't tow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can't be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty super power

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Too much to bare
Super power

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would move on
Without us, without us, without us

Beyoncé,"Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

Until you had enough and you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)

You used to dress and fix your hair
You'd always smile through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

And then you had enough and you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins

Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top

Beyoncé,"I found a love
For me
Oh darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl
Beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone
Waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a man
Stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams
I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love
To carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children
Of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
While listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass

Beyoncé,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, ""this shit is garbage""
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a God, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)
But only when it freezes (It's true)

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is

I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag

And I don't have to worry--only worry is him

And I'd do anything necessary for her

I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me

And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us

Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man

Welcome! Welcome!

Bienvenue là où l'fort tue le faible, où la faim tue de fait
Où la société t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite
Où les dettes cumulent, où l'crédit accule, des tas d'foyers
Où les hommes en perte d'idéaux, jurent qu'par les putes dévoyées en vidéo
Chaque soir c'est la fête, les salons cossus attirent les fesses
Sur les gros caïds, qui arrosent les guéridons de pure cocaïne
Ici, les gosses rêvent d'êt'Pirès, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent
Nombreux sont ceux qui dès 13 ans connaissent leur première ivresse
Bienvenue là où l'air pollué, par les pots d'échappement déclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Toluène
Les vices connus gênent la machine de l'état, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en état, peu passent les menottes en métal, on en est là
Ici 300 blindés font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramènent toutes leure p'tites gueules, quand mille meurent fauchés dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, après le 11 septembre on évoque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde à haute voix
Où les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les mômes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre à part ces connards en taule ?
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fantômes, un hymne sanguinaire, on entonne
Partout on sent la peur d'un peuple passé au pantone
L'hiver mange l'été, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne
Crie plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont égaré quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde

Welcome to a place where people lie to your face just to get it done
Welcome to the human race, if you ain't got money, you'll pay with pain
Welcome to this world of ours and if you had the chance would you come back again?
Cuz now you're here, ain't no turning back, got tears in your eyes, a monkey on your back
We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
We can't forget where we came from
We came from love

Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tantôt l'un tantôt l'autre
Ange et démon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent
Où l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement lorsqu'elle frappe à nos portes
Où la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup d’surin dans l'aorte
Où tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on t’le dit qu'20 ans après
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils l’diront jamais
Où on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon et ce avant qu'il meure
Puis on s’vante de l’connaître achetant ses tableaux, visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde où on se dit tous égaux, blague à part
Là c’est l'caniveau, là-haut c'est les bureaux, mais l’mieux c'est au milieu
Où on se sait si fragile qu'on prévoit les pièces d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achètera des jambes en famille le dimanche
Où tout le monde ne mange pas à sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Créer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne à ses fins
La misère comme moyen où le supposé mort esclavage sévit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois! Il y a toujours des grains d’poussière vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas à Gattaca mais presque où seul l'élu évite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse s’manifeste
Où on parle de présélection, d'amélioration, de transformation
Génétique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de supers soldats de plomb?
Où on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
Où on entend l’mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envolée la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'préfèrerais qu'tu l’découvres
Allez petit! Lance toi t'inquiète vas-y fonce! Moi, j'te couvre

Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She rides with me--the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B	

[Chorus]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect; nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry--only worry is him
She'd do anything necessary for him
And I'd do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yup

[Chorus]

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if the somebody was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

Leavin' their baby behind

At the one thing she knew to earn her few pennies a day

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers, you know those artificial flowers
Fashions from Annie's despair

With paper and shears, with some wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum
As snowflakes drifted into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

From makin' artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair

They found little Annie all covered with ice
Still clutchin' her poor frozen shears
Amidst all the blossoms she had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears

There must be a heaven where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers
And instea-a-ad of a halo, she'll wear 'round her head
A garland of genuine flowers

Brother Solzhenitsyn are you busy?
If not, won't you drop this friend a line?
Tell me if the man who is plowin' up your land
Has got the war machine upon his mind?

Come and sing the simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war

Now, no doubt some folks enjoy doin' battle
Like presidents, prime ministers and kings
So, let's all build them shelves
Where they can fight among themselves
Leave the people be who love to sing

Come and sing the simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war

I said let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people, here don't want a war

You're gonna miss me, baby

You'll feel so lonely

You're gonna miss my huggin'

A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath

And a love who's burnin' light will warm the winter night

Every man's blood boils
When turmoil or life foils his plans
I've soiled my hands puttin' work in
Tryna keep from hurtin', cause fools be irkin' the fuck outta me
Now what do I gotta be, the epitome of nice?
Biterally precise when I talk
And assuming when I walk I never let the chip show
Cause people try and push it and they want to test my wits
So, I'm defensive, intense with my brain waves
And that's offensive, I sense so the pain stays close
Most don't depressurize
When I've had it up to where you can see it in my eyes
Realize there's no sanity
Hella profanity and a sort fuse to light
I snort and use the mic like a weapon
Effectin' any section I step in
Got 'em checkin' for the vibe that I'm protectin'

[Asop]
Who takes the time to look around?
That which surrounds makes the sound of compromise
Damn, they try to size up to such plateau's they'll never touch
Always talkin' about nothin', when you catch 'em, they always hush
Not much to be said, not enough to be heard when the words become absurd
When a voice of a gangsta starts to emanate from the 'burbs
Now anybody, everybody can try to rock a party
With that bump in your trunk, always drunk with your motions
With no devotion, collects an ocean of funds
In the worst way, idiots they stay this way
Me hella 'noid like a homophobic stuck in the middle of a gay parade
With no way to escape the confines of one's mind
A mental prison, a prism of thought
A crystalis of anger created by the action of strangers
A dangerous way to live your life the these days
Thinkin' he hella fresh though
A male emcee acting like a lesbo
Making one's life so stressful
That's why I escape with these with the ease of a hiatus in Fresno

[PSC]
A rusty nail in the foot
A cavity in the tooth
My threshold, the pressure build up, to me I'm aloof
And no proof of a cracking point
Mood swings like primates
Gorilla in the mist type range, I see all states
I King Kong shit, rip down the house structure
Like Empire State, the power will surely crush you 
As a pun on a radio edit, or nasty soda
I'm colder in the heart when the camel back breaks
No one seen the true beast, release him and danger follows
Like sequels to horror flicks, there's no tomorrow
No sun will come out, no Annie, no Daddy Warbucks
The Hard Knock Life begins when tempers flare up
An enemy will show no mercy, take it from Percy
And stop at No Limit until the bullshit's ended

Rage, trapped in a cage
Wrapped in a page, you never change
Severed off from the vain
Not enough blood to complain
Rage enters the brain
Now it's a pain you can't maintain
Leaving friendships slain, always the other one to blame
Never to be the same, rage is just a game played
To someone less it runs deep on an unseen plain
Peep the problems of the average man when he's insane
Losing personality replaced by the devil's frame
Madness, uncanny love for the fact his life is lived in sadness
Can't handle the Silence so The Lambs get reprimanded
For the underhanded, under kept raging thunderclap
You're wondering ""What's that?""
It's the wrath of rage-aholics

People playing games with my mind
Playing games every time that I find 
Confined to a world, disillusion mind
I'm losing my patience, losing time
Wasting my patience, you wasting time
Not facing who you are
Enraged in cages, enslaved in graves
We lay, relay, we play 
Beating on drums till the warrior battle comes
Native son chasing the moon in smoke filled rooms
Chasing hell to it's doom, boom
Like losing a check on payday
Holding a grip, it's stressful
It's not your fault, it never is

Then dig within inside and try to change shit

Reflect your mind
Reflect through time

(PSC):
My relation to these words spoken over beats leaps to and fro
All around, bound the energy in miles
Piles up towards the sky
High quantity of thoughts
Reflect the truth, sold another brother on the watch
On the clock of life, the mirror view
The clearest of reflection
Inspection of the lie that lies deep behind the stressin'
And it's pressing me like time
Rhymes is just illusions
A world in confusion
A dream of revolution
These reflections like mine in the puddle of life
Skip rocks, waves making ripple effects
Situations etched, lessons in stone tablets
For the reference to the habit
Forming addictions to the memories of past shit
I let go, it comes back
Boomerang behavior runs common in the obstacles
I want to shake my coat tails
They follow on the missions of my failure
Bring me down, crush me
Reflections can be beautiful, but most the time they rush me

And in an instance you see the mirror image looking at you
Looks just like you, got you eyes, and you whole disguise

Reflected on the grass roots which harbors all the snakes
Otherwise known as a snake pit
Remember the python on you ankle and all that fake shit?
Remember when the cake was lit, and the wind blew it out?
Before you could taste the cream, they sliced it up and threw it out
I recollect, I think back in retrospect
I reflect and connect my memories
Remember these good times and these hard times
But it's like that, and that's the way it is
And that's the way it was, but that ain't how it gotta be
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if I knew then what I knew now, I'd be doin' fine
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if you knew then what you know now, you'd be doin' fine

Reflect though time....
I peep when I meet people, evil or positive
We live in the middle, lost within the riddle
On God's reflection I stand, within an intersection of life lost
Double crossed by man, we stand ignorant
False prophet, gothic, prehistoric logic mixed our minds
Reflectin' signs of anger, reflection banger, reflection slanger
Reflection bombing hangars of 747's
Strangers want to blow this shit to heaven
Reflection war, reflectin' poor, reflectin' Cold War
Reflectin' old multiple metal jacket tactics
You might see Murs reflectin' curse
Reflectin' hurts, you's a bitch in a male skirt
If you don't work to change your world, reflectin' hurls
In life with wisdom, beyond ""blaow! blaow!""

We used to be in love with Duran Duran in '95

The niggas who took it turned around and got his ass busted.
I'm out here, half the time I don't sleep.
How Imma sleep when I'm in the streets and I got beef.
On my block it's war; we live like we in Pakistan,
I got the mac in my pants, and I got crack in my hands.
I give it how you want it; I take it how it come.

Never wanna line up, I don’t do McDonald’s
Fuck, crazy you know I’m breaking necks when I’m pulling up “skrrt”
All my numbers looking outrageous
Now the blogs handing out praises
Got the world using my phrases
Hoes keep my name in their mouth
Hope it tastes like shit when they say it “don’t say my name, bitch”
Barring out, I ain’t got Xans in me, no
Young but I’m balling like a damn CEO
Bentley truck, said don’t give a fuck
Came from the street, boy and beef shit, they know what’s up
Bitches that hold no position
Come at me, fall in my mentions
Hoes be thirsty for attention
Knock a ho out this dimension
Then continue my ascension “why you so mad?”
How you hoes living with no purpose?
I be putting venom in my verses
Bitch you worthless, you ain’t fucking with my worst shit
Doubted me, now it’s all coming together like cursive “like cursive, bitch”
$50k a show, I’m doing 30 of ’em
5 million by the summer, keep the numbers running
Bitches showing everything, I be understunting “damn”
Understanding your regard, really had nothing “shit”
Shit, but now I’m breaking records and I’m making history “wow”
How can they stop me? I swear it’s a mystery
Parents so sick of me, shouts to their misery
Let your kids listen to me!
How I do me if you was on a slow day
And I ain’t gotta go to school like a snow day
But my, in the stu so it’s okay
Bank account look like a lick
Broke ho, you look like you sick
Slide on the beat like it’s slick
Bitch don’t compare me to Iggy
That old ho is washed and I’m lit
Wouldn’t pay her to wash up my whip
Bye broke bitch, bye ho

Bhad Bhabie,"Bitch, you're just mad, you think you know me, you don't
You don't know the real-life situations I've been through and what really goes on in my life
All you know is what you see, don't believe everything you see on the internet
I'm just tired of everybody's opinion, like y'all need to just hear the real story
(Stop Bhad Bhabie)

Finally reached out to my dad
We met at the mall on some other shit
Pissed off by his tattoos 'cause they had the names of his other kids
Like fuck me, I don't exist
And you actin' like I'm s'posed to praise you?
My whole life you bought a pair of J's
And you think I'm s'posed to say, ""Thank you""?
That's when I knew I didn't need dad
My mom was pissed, I was sellin' pills
Couldn't even afford rehab
So she put me on Dr. ****
Got on stage and fuckin' blacked out
I look up, I'm in a ranch now
Did four months in solitary
Bet that y'all know it ain't a act now
Fuck it, hit a ho with no bars
I remember seein' Clay kill a staff member, Jimmy with a crowbar
They fled the scene in Alicia's car
Came home jumped on the scene
I look online and I'm a fuckin' meme
Said I'd shoot my mom, I on't go fuckin' mean
You don't know what I seen, what the fuck you mean?
I took all the pain in my heart
Carried that shit to the charts
Even when they protested, I still got more blessings
I never dissed my mom to get some attention
Take a second and listen
'Fore you give yo' dumbass opinion, you bitch

You ain't seen nothin'
You don’t know what I’ve been through
You haven't been there with me
So don't tell me what I went through
Don't tell me that I disrespect my mom for the fuck of it
Don't tell me I’m just bad for the fuck of it
Bitch you don't know my life
You don’t know what I been through
Unless you were there with me
You can't tell me nothing ho

So after 6 months of being on Dr. **** show
I finally got home (finally, I was gone for so long)
And I got home from a ranch
And it was pretty miserable, I had no touch (fucking horrible)
Like I was not in touch with the internet
I did not know what was going on (at all)
To the real world
This place was far away from anything
Like, no phones, no internet, no nothing
Like there wasn't even service there (nothing)
And a couple a weeks after being home
I finally decided that I wanted to meet with my best friend again
(I just missed her and I wanted to see her again)
Someone who was not good for me at all
But I ended up going to her house to see her
And instantly like, I'd say it was the next day
'Cause she had slept over my house
We just got back to doing our old shit again
Smoking, like, like, trying to finesse people for money
Like, just doing really, really dumb shit again (Like, really, really dumb shit)
So since I was back out outside the house
My mom decided to give me my phone
Because I was running around with Zandaline (Take your phone back Dani)
She wanted to make sure that if something happened I could be able to call her or whatever
So (Just in case)

I logged in on Instagram that I hadn’t been on for almost seven months now
And (Should've just stayed off of it)
Every, all these people were following me
Everyone was commenting on my pictures
I had almost like five-hundred-thousand followers
And I was like, ""What the fuck is this?""
So I went on the explore page and there was a bunch of memes
That was just my face that said, ""Catch me outside""
And I was like, ""What the fuck is this?""
Like I had never, like
I never even imagined that would happen (this shit's just so stupid)
Like I didn't even remember saying, ""Catch me outside""
That's the funniest thing
Like, until I seen the, the bit from, from the show
Like, I didn't even remember I said that
Like, like, that shit was so irrelevant (This shit's so irrelevant)
Like, it was just some random ass shit

So, like, a couple weeks later I had six-hundred-thousand followers
And it was crazy, I was like
These people didn’t even know if it was my real account
Like, I had never verified that it was my real shit
So it was kind of crazy (They were just following it 'cause I guess people liked it)
And then my
Or, and then now this guy Adam had knocked on my door
And I was like, ""Can I help you? Like, what do you want?""
He was like ""Do you sing? Do you rap? Do you do anything?""
And he was like, ""Well I wanna bring you to LA""
So me, I was like, ""LA? Okay cool!"" (Just trust me, I'll make you a star)
So I went out there and
I met Meechie and I met, um, Adam's management partner, Dan
(I got you that checkmark! Are we cool?)
And I stayed out there for a little bit
I did some interviews and did some videos and stuff
And then I went back to Florida
And me and ZZ were just like walking like the streets
Where it's like going to the beach and stuff
And people kept taking pictures of me
And they kept like
We- we kept getting into fights
And like even some of ZZ’s friends got into fights about me
And I was getting sued for it I was getting blamed for it
So I then I hired my body guard, Frank
Because (hey, I'm Frank)
He's a big ass muhfucker and he'll beat up everybody and they mama
(Just go fuck yourself)
So me and ZZ had went somewhere with one of her friends
And we ended up getting tattoos that night
And I didn't tell Adam I was gonna do it
'Cause I didn't think he would care, like
I didn't think he really, like, gave a fuck
So I ended up getting a tattoo
The tattoo I have on my arm (It says family first)
And I went home
And Adam had called me and he
Or he FaceTimed me and he seen it
And he was like, ""Oh my god, you're going to fuckin'-, you're, you're goin', you're goin' back to LA
I can't have you out here doin' this shit
Like, you're gonna fuck yourself, you're gonna get in trouble
This is not happening anymore""

So before he had sent me back to LA
That day I met this girl Gabby
Who I then started dating or talking to for a couple months
(I don't know why, kinda don't really don't know why)
And I was living with her in her trailer
And it was crazy like every time I'd go outside
Like, there was all the neighborhood kids were surrounding like her house
(Everyone wanted to see me and wanted pictures)
Meanwhile while my dad was trying to get back in my life
And I didn't understand why
So I told him, like, ""No, I don't want you to be in my life
Like fourteen years and you haven't been here
Now all of a sudden, you see I have fans and followers and all this
And now you wanna get back in my life?
Like, no, it's not gonna work that way,"" (Nope)
He didn't like that so he went to press
He went to other cops (Everywhere you could imagine)
He went to news stations, and other TV hosts and all this shit
Facebook, Instagram, twitter (Dumbass)
Talking all the shit he possibly could
Just trying to sabotage my whole career that wasn't a career yet
(He just wanted money he just wanted his voice to be heard)
He wanted to make sure that every time I went to court
He went as well and tried to fuck shit up
He lied to the judge, told the judge I was suicidal
Told the judge I needed sexual ed. classes
Like just a bunch of unnecessary bullshit

So fast forward, fuck my dad (Fuck his bitch, pussy ass)
Then my manager was like, ""Okay, let's go to this recording studio
Like, I have a few people I want you to meet""
So I went there, I met this A and R, Aton (What's good Bhad Bhabie)
And he was like, ""Well, we have this song, we want- like, we want you to record it
We want to see how you sound"" (We gotta try this out, lets try this)
And it was just, it was literally just, ""Hi bitch, hi bitch, hi bitch""
It was not, no other (It's just a hook right now but we'll work on this) No other lyrics
It was just a beat and the words, ""Hi bitch""
So we made some verses, we finished the hook (Yo, Aton this shit is fire)
And Aton loved the song (Dan, Adam, Mike, Karen, call the lawyers)
And he was like, ""You know what? You're gold. I wanna sign you.""",Bhad Bhabie Story (Outro),2018
