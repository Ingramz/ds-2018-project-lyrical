Michael Jackson,"There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than living
A better way for us to survive
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more than meets the eye
What good is life, if in the end we all must die
There must be more to life than this

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this
I live in hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this",There Must Be More to Life Than This,2014

Michael Jackson,"I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
To spend the night was the goal she played (She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

I never would’ve thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was loving me)
She said just to give her a page
To spend the night was the goal she played
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife (She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why, oh no
Alright
Oh
(I’m in love, love)

I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
Swear that I would’ve never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I’m holding her blame

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can (Holding her to blame)

Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Holding her to blame)

Michael Jackson,"Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says ""What's going on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone!""

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat!

Do you know where your children are?

Save me (from this living hell)
Save me (cause I don't wanna know)
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
""I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair""
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!

Michael Jackson,"Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Michael Jackson,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
Nothing to fear fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
La la la
A place without no name
La la la

Michael Jackson,"She dances in these sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
""Sir, I must be home tonight""

Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Michael Jackson,"Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The systems in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is what I need
From the electric eyes

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They realize on my name, and push from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away

Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships haven't gone my way
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you
I can do what I want to

You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night

Michael Jackson,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Woah oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
There's no in fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
Grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
We're in a world that I wanna lead

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?

December 24th, Ten P.M. Eastern Standard Time
I can't believe a year went by so fast
Time to see - What we have - Time to see
Turn the projector on

With the Fender guitar he just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back
ROGER
I found my song

He found his song

I tried - You know I tried

I wonder how he found out about Mimi?

Maybe a little bird told her.

I had a little hunch that you could use a little flow
ROGER

Well. . .?

Michael John Stanley,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

Sure plays a mean pinball!

Got such a supple wrist.

I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.

I'll still, I will love you

Michael Johnson,"There's a quarter moon that's laying up on the ridge
And he's making up his mind to rise or to set
There's a lot of water flowing under this bridge
There's a voice inside me saying ""Get your feet wet""

'Cause that's that, I can scream, I can shout
I can cry my eyes out but she's not coming back
And that's that, I can hope, I can pray
But she's still gone away
And she's not coming back and that's that

There's a weeping willow on the outskirts of town
Where I took a pocket knife and carved out our names
In the morning I am gonna cut that tree down
Gonna build a fire and watch us go up in flames

And that's that, I can scream, I can shout
I can tear my hair out but she's not coming back
And that's that, I can hope, I can pray
But she's still gone away
And she's not coming back and that's that

Ooh there's a lonesome whisper in the wind
Ooh don't you hate to see the season end
But then

Michael Johnson,"The lady stands before the open window
Staring so far away
She can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching her restless days

She turns from the window to me
A sad smile, her apology
Sad eyes reaching for the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still she spares me the word goodbye
She sits alone beside me fighting her feelings
She struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

Suddenly, it's so hard to find
The words that would help her speak her troubled mind
I'm offering these to her as if to be kind

There's a train everyday, leaving either way
There's a train everyday, leaving either way
There is a world you know
There is a way to go, there is a world you know
And we'll soon be gone , it's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawing on the table
A woman's silk lying on the floor
And I would keep them here if I were able
To lock them safe behind my open door

Suddenly it's so clear to me
I've asked her to see what she may never see
Now my kind words find their way back to me

Michael Johnson,"The old folks don't talk much and they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone, they share one heart for two
Their homes all smell of time, of old photographs and an old fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away when you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says yes, it says no, it says I'll wait for you

The old folks dream no more, the book have gone to sleep and the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing on a Sunday afternoon
They old folks move no more, the world's become too small, their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out arm in arm, arm in arm, in the morning chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last goodbye to one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says yes, it says no, it says I'll wait for you

The old folks never die, they just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand, like children in the dark but one would get lost anyway
And the other will remain just sitting in a room which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away and echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun filled park where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much, but life goes on for still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says yes, it says no, it says I'll wait for you

The old, old silver clock
That's hanging on the wall
That waits for us all",Old Folks,1999
Michael Johnson,"Back in 1958, we drove an old V-8
And when it turned a hundred thou, we pushed it a mile

We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

Heading south from Canada on a graveled road a mile from Montana
Then my daddy read the sign that took us in the wrong direction

I asked my daddy where are we going, he just said we're following our nose
So I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy

We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

I met a girl in a truck cafe, I fell in love almost right away
But the Mercury was ready to go and I had to leave her

We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

And when I'd seen all the sights, there was the moon so round
Go home, said the man in the moon, go home
Go home, said the man in the moon, go home
Because it's getting sorta late, and I'll soon put out my light
So go home, said the man in the moon, go home

Bad dreams roll and rise
Pilot me, pilot me
No tears wash my eyes
Pilot me, pilot me

This day might go right down
My body cannot go
My feet they move too slow

With gravel and spit in his voice
He laughed at the things we do, the radio laughed too

Michael Johnson,"Last night you pushed me a little too far
I was not coming back when I left in the car
And there was a time, an hour or two
I was feeling so free from you

I picked up a bottle and drove to the heights
I parked on a ridge and I looked at the lights
The engine was off and the radio on
And the singer sang and I sang along

And I was almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I was almost free, whole new life ahead of me
Almost free

Sunrise rising over the wheel
The bottle is empty and so is the feel
This car knows it's the wrong thing to do
But it's driving me home to you

Maybe I'm too much in love to be strong
Maybe you knew I'd be back all along
And if I could be who you wanted I would
If I could forget I'd be gone for good

I was almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I feel almost free
Whole new life ahead of me, almost free

Just too hard to walk this line
Maybe baby, I'll make it next time

Almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I was almost free, whole new life ahead of me

I was almost free, whole new life ahead of me

Michael Johnson,"If there are reasons why I should come down off this cloud
I don't know them
If the law says that walking on air is not allowed
I'll just show them, I'll just show them

And if I am not dreaming, then dreams do come true
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you

If there are reasons why I should not feel so alive
I don't buy them
And if they tell me our love's just too hot to survive
I deny them, I defy them
 
And if true love is unending then this love is true
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you

When it comes to forever, it's never too late
And if this isn't heaven, then heaven can wait

And if love was a candle, I'd shine like the sun

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'd be rich as Rockefeller

Michael Kaeshammer,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Michael Kiske,"Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies,
Give me two eyes to see the truth.
Give me two legs I think I have to run,
And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose.
I don't wanna lose ...


Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there,
Make me feel your presence in the night.
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie,
And take my soul - so I won't have to hide.
I don't wanna hide ...
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe.
I Believe ... I Believe ...


It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ...
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light,
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright.


I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ...


I wanna love but I always hate - I wanna give but I always take.
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die.
It's so much easier said than done - I know I can't just always run.
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not.
I know it's true what J.C. said - I got it all clear in my head.
Seens we were born to be unfair,
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe.


Give me your hand until the end and I will waik into promised land.
I don't deserve anything you do - but I can't stop loving you.


No more lies, no false religions,
No more ""whys"" and wrong God missions.
No shiny T.V. priests begging to cash,
No more wars that no God's ever asked for.
There's a way back out of here - one day we're going home,
Tell everyone who wants to hear - whatever you do ... do Believe.


I Believe ... We Believe ... Believe ... Oh !



",I Believe,2008
Michael Kiske,"In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night I call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.


I always try to makethings better, everything that has gone wrong,
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done.
Everyday when I try to get forward - I find myself another mile back,
Help me fighting, help me breathing - why am I falling down instead ?
Every useful minute seems to be the thoughtof you,
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do.
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true.


In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night I call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.


Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find,
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside.
The hours we waste - we may not get back for a while,
And when it gets dark - no chance will be there for atry.


When I wake up early in the morning I catch abook and jump inside,
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light.
The moment when I get things clearer - I see another mountain to climb.
And always when I think I'm nearer - I realize there is no time.


In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night I call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
Sometimes I cried after all Ilied to you.

",In the Night,2008
Michael Kiske,"We poison our hearts
We poison our seas
We burn down the paradise

We're stoppin' good waves
We're losin' our trees
The future looks bright ahead
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies

We're lost in this time--we create so fine
The future we already fear
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt
The future looks bright ahead

We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Ev'rything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't wanna fall

Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you
Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth
But you run away from the lies you can't say
Don't run away from the lies you can't say

We're the kids. . .

Michael Kiske,"Now it's time - to shake it all up, to be free,
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be.
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad,
When everything good looks so bad,
When everything right goes so wrong.


I am up - to break it all down what's in my way,
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay.
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back,
Don't wanna be what I am not,
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck.


I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
Over my head - look over my head
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
And you won't see no halo
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
It's driving me mad
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
I must hold it back inside
But anyway we've got to make a stop.


When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !


In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up,
Will we find - the key of life we oncehave dropped ?
Do you really care ? - Tell me you really care !
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere.


Give me light to see my inside, give me light tosee my sin,
Over my head - look over my head
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad,
And you won't see no halo
You must be joking when you point at me.
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me !
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think!
It's driving me mad
Why should I give what I can drink ?
I must hold it back inside


When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !


Pain - I feel inside - it's such a Shame.
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ?
Might be the game of life but it ain't over.
Now ! I walk my way firm any
Now ! My conscience speaks and there are Doubts !
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now !


I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
Over my head - look over my head
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
And you won't see no halo
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
It's driving me mad
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
I must hold it back inside
But anyway we've got to make a stop.


When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you ! ......



",When the Sinner,2008
Michael Kiske,"[Music + lyrics: M. Kiske]

[Solo: both]

When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back

[Bridge:]


There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
And I reveal what I have loved before

[Bridge:]


There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

[Chorus:]


The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone

[Solo: Kai/Mike]

Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why
He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin

You--you cannot hide
You--you cannot describe your feelings inside

[Solo: Mike/Kai]

[Chorus:]


The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone



",You Always Walk Alone,2008
Michael Kiske,"Now there is this day, a lot of things are changing
Can't just kick it away, got to get things right
Sometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to last
The thing that I once started isn't mine anymore
I guess now it's my turn

You've got a face like a child, got a mind like a woman
Your smile is warm and tender
I hear the people say that I should stay away
From you and all the problems you might bring
They'll never know--you
Nobody ever knows what to do
They'll never see you cry
They'll never know why

Now it's your turn to break free
When you want it all you've got to see
Now it's your turn to break free
When you want the life, you've got to see what it means

See the little boy holding mama's hand
His eyes can see the things we've long forgotten
The world is easy now--and somehow
He's right
Until there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go away

It's your turn to break free. . .

This world is crying to be free
This world is dying can't you see
We need a turn to do it right
We need a mind-revolution
To get away from this selfishness
Stop playing blind--break free



",Your Turn,2008
Michael Kiske,"Feelings come and go, I've never known,
Something longs to grow, won't let go.
Spirits around my head, are whispering,
I turn inside instead, of wondering.

Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know, what's written inside me,
How could I see anything, how could I be anything ?

Restless minds have searched, long before,
The truth will be same, for evermore.
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel,
Can give you all you need, just listen still.
Here is love and there is pain.
It's all around, it's all the same,
There's nothing new that I could tell to you.
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts,
We might not know the mining yet, but I am sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be.

There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know,
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do
Until we're home!

Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know, what's written inside me,
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?
Feelings come and go, I've never known",Longing,2008
Michael Kiske,"[Music + lyrics: M. Kiske]

Don't turn your head
Back to the wall
Don't close your eyes
And wait for your fall

If you believe that you know in this time
You've got anything to win
If you believe that you know
Then I say, ""you'll lose all again""

[Bridge:]


In this time there's nothing to get for you
You cannot really do what you want
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind
You are a victim of this hopeless time

You better believe all you do has a sense
It's not for nothing
You better believe all the troubles you have
Will play you someday

[Bridge:]


Why don't you help yourself and do the best
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
Why don't you stand up to say who you are
To show the people that paradise is not far

[Chorus:]


Oh, can't you see we got the right
To look into the future without no need to hide
No, we won't accept what you do
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
Oh, can't you see we got the right
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can

[Solo: both]

We are credulous idiots
And won't understand what they plan
We march with the times
It's what they expect and we do

Why don't you open your eyes
To undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
Go oppose with your fist
Fight for your rights

[Chorus:]


Oh, can't you see we got the right
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can

How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the canon balls fly before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

The answer is blowin' in the wind.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Why not forget your crazy dream
About a love that can't exist
Cause while you dream so much you miss
You waste a lifetime

Just take a look below the surface
His golden hair will be turning grey
Though in your mind you pictured heaven
Even heaven has a rainy day

No one touch a dream
So forever you've been on your own
You're older and you are still all alone

Why not forget your crazy dream
About a love that can't exist
Cause while you dream so much you miss
You waste a lifetime

Why don't you take a look around
Not everyone has settled down
But you still think you're seventeen
It's a crazy dream

So take a chance and take your shot
No paradise but it's all we've got
And I will try to make your dreams come true",Crazy Dream,1991
Michael Learns to Rock,"I been here waiting for someone to share my vision 
Coming here tonight was not the best decision 
You look like someone who might welcome some direction 
You look like one who's grown accustomed to attention 

Come and be yourself with me baby talk to me 
Loose your self inside the beat 

I won't be gone after midnight I'm not at dream 
This dream will vanish in daylight but I will be 

My life is a late night party in the smokey light 
Strangers move together whispering sweet lies 
Dancers move like lovers leave the world behind 
A secret wish takes hold and burns down deep inside 

Common people find uncommon states of mind 
You'll want it more and more each time 

I won't be gone after midnight I'm not a dream 
This dream will vanish in daylight but I will be",Gone After Midnight [CD Only],1991

you just drink the water yourself

you just push me down again

",I Still Carry On,1991
Michael Learns to Rock,"I wake up in a sweat can't sleep I'm soaking wet
I toss and turn the whole night through
I keep going in and out of time
I just can't seem to bear
My world without you there
You've gone back to the life you knew
But somehow I just can't get back to mine

When you went away nothing I could say
Could ever bring you back to me
Your lipstick cherry red the hours in my bed
Still haunt my memory

A kiss in the rain on a dark afternoon
A heart so in pain 'cause love came too soon
A taste of her lips still lingers in vain
A sad souvenir of a kiss in the rain

He could offer more than long walks on the shore
My love for you was not enough
Girl I couldn't keep the flame alive
Still when I close my eyes it's you I visualize
Though I try to shout it out
Don't you know these feelings still survive

Was it just a fling a temporary thing
I find the letters that you wrote
And though I set you free you're still a part of me
The spell can not be broke

A heart so in pain 'cause love came too soon
A taste of her lips still lingers in vain

When I woke up in my bed 
Opened my eyes this morning 
I saw the heavy black side of my soul 
was creeping out the window 
The happiness I felt disappeared again 
'cause there was someone 
knocking at my door 
I guess it was the postman 
with a lot of messages 
from the world outside 

Chorus: 
Keep all your bills 
keep all your papers away from here 
Leave me alone 
it is such a lovely day 
No matter what you do in your life 
You know you always have to sign 
In a world where we are drowning in papers 
it's difficult to hold the line 
Newspaper pages always full of lies 
Letters that make me cry 
Sometimes I think that I've got enough 
You better keep that stuff 
away from sy side

She is the girl and I really want to make her mine
I'm searching everywhere to find her again
To tell her I love her
And I'm sorry 'bout the things I've done
I find her standing in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looks so happy in her wedding dress
But she's crying while she's saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Against the wind I'm going home again
Wishing me back to time when we were more than friends
But I still see her in front of the church

This is twenty five minutes too late

Twenty five minutes too late

Places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat
Inside my head still I can hear the words she said

This is twentyfive minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are

I won't forget the way you're kissing

That's why you go away I know",That's Why (You Go Away),1995
Michael Learns to Rock,"Take a look around this lonely place 
Where a mask is worn on every face 
And painted lips gently kiss 
The end of their cigarettes 

This world is dressed in such finesse 
To cover all the emptiness 
We're standing here in between 
The pages of a magazine

You'll never know what I feel inside me 
I'll never know what you think about 
Until we share what we keep in private 
Until we find what we're living without 

Our shadows move across the wall 
No promises no talk at all 
Inside the crowd we dance alone 
With faces made of stone 

You'll never know what I feel inside me 
I'll never know what you think about 
Until we share what we keep in private 
Until we find what we're living without",You'll Never Know,1995

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky

Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.

Michael Lee Jackson,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Parfois du bout des yeux,
Même riches ils sont pauvres, 
Ils n'ont plus d'illusions, 
Et n'ont qu'un cœur pour deux.
Chez eux ça sent le thym, 
Le propre, la lavande, 
Et le verbe d'antan,
Que l'on vive à Paris, 
On vit tous en province 
Quand on vit trop longtemps.
Est-ce d'avoir trop ri 
Que leur voix se lézarde 
Quand ils parlent d'hier?
Et d'avoir trop pleuré 
Que des larmes encore 
Leur perlent les paupières?
Et s'ils tremblent un peu 
Est-ce de voir vieillir 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui dit ""Je vous attends"".

Leurs livres s'ensommeillent, 
Leurs pianos sont fermés,
Le petit chat est mort.

Les vieux ne bougent plus, 
Leurs gestes ont trop de rides, 
Leur monde est trop petit,
Du lit à la fenêtre, 
Puis du lit au fauteuil, 
Et puis du lit au lit,
Et s'ils sortent encore 
Bras dessus, bras dessous, 
Tout habillés de raide,
C'est pour suivre au soleil

L'enterrement d'une plus laide,
Et le temps d'un sanglot

Et puis qui les attend.

Les vieux ne meurent pas, 
Ils s'endorment un jour 
Et dorment trop longtemps,
Ils se tiennent la main, 
Ils ont peur de se perdre, 
Et se perdent pourtant
Et l'autre reste là, 
Le meilleur ou le pire, 
Le doux ou le sévère,
Cela n'importe pas, 
Celui des deux qui reste 
Se retrouve en enfer.

Vous le verrez parfois 
En pluie et en chagrin
Traverser le présent.

De n'être pas plus loin.
Et fuir devant vous

Around us in our violence, Laughter for our silence,
Yes, but underneath the comfort of our dinner conversations, 
There’s a fumbling of the moments, Cause we know that we are fading

But we were supposed to be beautiful, you and I
We were supposed to be beautiful, and though we try
We are not so beautiful, you and I

Just another grey-sky morning, Cast aside the scorning 
Of the second-hand clock ticking, Quickening the moments 
And every day bleeds into yesterday and into tomorrow
Until we find our way back down under this earth we only borrow

But we were supposed to be beautiful, you and I

Michael Londra,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006
Michael Longo,"On a rainy night, you showed up at my door
Child of the night, down and forlorn
Still I took you in, it's in the stars above
All girls are made the same, they all need a little love 
And the magic of the moment
Exploded with desire
When the time is right, the sparks ignite
And set the night on fire 

It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin, too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell, in the heavens tonight 

I was livin' hard, I was feelin' down and lonely
When toward the boulevard, a limousine moved slowly
And I noticed in the back seat, a lady wrapped in fur
Her eyes burned through me, and mine stared back at her 
And I recognized the moment
As I opened up her door
I knew I would regret it
I've been burned before 

It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin, too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell, in the heavens tonight 

And lord it's so hot when the chain reaction
Is set off with a kiss
And it's so tough when the satisfaction
Is greater than the risk
When you look in her eyes and you realize
This time you can't resist

It's chain lightnin' 
And the magic of the moment
Exploded with desire
When the time is right the sparks ignite
And set the night on fire 
It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night

Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin, too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell, in the heavens tonight

dreaming of you
Pretty valentine
Bleeding again from the sole of her shoes

Would you take it easy on me
Would you take it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could

I was up all night drinking of you
We got into a fight
Love always drains the life out of me
But I can't complain
I'm in the deep freeze

Would you take it easy on me
Would you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Keep me in line through the grace of your heart
Keep me alive through the grace of your heart

I got up alright
Breakfast for two
Pieces of hate all over the room
Your love is a light that leads to my soul
That's melting the wall,
That's drowning me, so

Would you take it easy on me
Could you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart

Stories of friendship
And tales of how romance survives
I have so many songs

Stories of yeses
Of frogs making messes
And poor unsuccessful and fat people's lives

Stories of living
Stories of dying
And ways we can deal with our fear

Stories of horses, parental divorces
And how rich or poor, it's a very small sphere
Where we appear

You gotta have heart and music
Heart and music, get along

You gotta have heart and music
You gotta have heart and music
Heart and music, make a song

If I only had the time
What I would write for your delight

Songs of improving
And everyone talks about change
I have so many songs

Stories of stillness
Of people not moving
And throwing out books when things turn out too strange
We rearrange

You gotta have heart and music

And I dreamed the night
and almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
and no one can take her love away
Ooo love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
and no one will take her love away
I wanna be love

And I mean all these words I said
And you don't have to guess
what's going on inside me head
Just try to know
All the things that our heart says
Listen to love and always
get love to lead the way
Whenever you love

You know for love
I'd go anywhere
I would go there
For love to the end of nowhere
And for your love
(And for your love)
I would,
I would
I would love
To just spend all my time
With a girl who makes me
feel her love is mine
Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
And she be in love
just because she wanna be
She wanna be loved

There's nothing better than love
What in the world
could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

Better pass the joint

Michael Martin Murphey,"Because he called the forest brother
Because he called the earth his mother
They drove him out into the rain
And some people even said
That the boy from the country was insane

Because he spoke with fish in the creek
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak
And who knows, maybe they do
Hey, how do you know they don't
Just because they've never spoken to you

Boy from the country
Left his home when he was young
Boy from the country
He loves the sun

He tried to tell us that we should love the land
We just turned our heads and laughed
You see we did not understand

But you know sometimes I think
The boy from the country
Must be the only one who sees
Because the boy from the country
Doesn't want to see the forest
He'd rather see the trees

Boy from the country
Left his home when he was young
Boy from the country
He loves the sun

Said she'd known me a long time
And she spoke of being in love
With every mountain she had climbed

And she talked of trails she'd walked up
Far above the timber line
From that night on I knew I'd write a song
With Carolina in the pines

There's a new moon on the fourteenth
First quarter, the twenty first
And the full moon in the last week
Brings a fullness to this earth

There's no guesswork in the clockwork
Of the world's heart or mind
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines

When the frost shows on the windows
And the wood stove smokes and glows
As the fire grows we can warm ourselves
Watching rainbows in the coals

And we'll talk of trails we walked up
Far above the timber line
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines

On a dark flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire
Whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down his stall
In a blizzard she was lost

She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire

By the dark of the moon I planted
But there came an early snow
There's been a hoot owl howlin' by my window now
For six nights in a row
She's coming for me I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go

We'll be riding Wildfire

Michael Martin Murphey,"When the train pulled into the station
He slicked back his hair, rosined up his bow
Fiddle upside-down, Orange Blossom Special
If you want to make a living then you've got to put on a good show

When he smelled the smoke and the cinders
Rolled his sleeves up, opened up his case
Played Cherokee Fiddle, played for the whiskey
Good whiskey never let him lose his place

He was always there playing for the miners
Devil's Dream was a tune they all understood
Then he'd go home to Oklahoma
And wait 'till the trains were runnin' and the weather was good

When he smelled the smoke and the cinders
Rolled his sleeves up, opened up his case
Played Cherokee Fiddle, played for the whiskey
Good whiskey never let him lose his place

And the cowboys are puttin' leather and turquoise on
And the music gets sold by the lawyers
And the fools who fiddled in the middle of the stations are gone

Some folks say they'll never miss them
Fiddle screeched like the engine break
Ol' Cherokee Fiddle gone forever
Like the sound that the whistle on an old locomotive make

Stirring sparks of love into desire
Memories ignite the scattered ember lights
Baby, I've still got the fire

Through the flame of love burns low for a long long time
Tonight I feel the passion burning high
Love unbound by time need never pass it by
Baby, I've still got the fire

I still want you so much you haven't lost your touch
Baby, I've still got the fire In my heart
There's no doubt, the ashes never burned out
Baby, I've still got the fire

And so as I ride across my lost highway
No matter what the future may require
Hope of love will drive me through my destined day
Knowing I've still got the fire

I still want you so much

And this fire that burns within never will go cold
And I'll never let it burn out of control
I still want you so much
Still got the fire

Michael Martin Murphey,"Driving West out on I-40
On my way to taste some California wine
A broke down family flagged me down
Near the Arizona line

Their whole world was in a pickup
I guess it couldn't pull the load
It was just our vacation
But to them it was desperation road

The lines on their faces
Told the story of the places that they'd been
Now their home is a highway
That never seems to end

Empty dreams and empty pockets
Sure can make a heavy load
To some of us it's just a highway
But to others it's desperation road

Their eyes had a sadness
From another place in time
A silent reminder that the grapes of wrath
Still make bitter wine

And it sure makes you wonder
'Bout all the seeds our country sows
Which of us will be the next
To travel down desperation road

I helped them start their pickup
And watched them as they faded out of sight
Guess the last thing I remember
Is the faces of the children in my lights

That night in a motel room
I have a dream that made my blood run cold
I saw my own wife and family
Standing out on desperation road

And their eyes had a sadness
From another place in time
A silent reminder that the grapes of wrath
Still make bitter wine

And it sure makes you wonder

Gonna build it good using all my strength
Gonna clear the land where the house will be

I'll cut the beams above from mahogany
And I'll get the love from the family tree

Till the morning star finally led me home

With a friendly face and a bunch of kids

When the sun was going down
Sittin' on the front porch
Listenin' to the sounds

While mama did the dishes
Daddy rolled a smoke
From a can of old Prince Albert
His hands as strong as oak

And the sounds of the Grand Old Opry came out of Ryman Hall
Roy Acuff played the fiddle and sang, Wabash Cannonball
Hank Williams whispered, I Saw the Light
And people everywhere sat listening in the night

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

Then Wolfman Jack came a howlin'
From across the Rio Grande
Layin' down the sounds that all the kids could understand
Mama and daddy was sleepin'

But the kids were wide awake
Listenin' to Bill Haley rattle, roll, and shake
Ol' Jerry Lee banged on the keys and screamed, Great Balls of Fire
Elvis crooned out, Don't Be Cruel
The girls swooned with desire

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

I remember summer evenings
Late night rock and roll
Miles and miles of highway
With just my radio

I remember a night when it felt so right
A lover's moon above
And the songs that they were playin'
The night we fell in love

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

Michael Martin Murphey,"I've been looking at people 
And how they change with the times;
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds;

Maybe it's me that's gone crazy, 
Cause I can't figure out why;
All these lovers keep hurting each other,
When good love is so hard to come by;

[Chorus:]
So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me 
What's forever for?

I've been listening to people 
And they say love is the key;
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray;
It's only that I want to believe;

[Chorus]

I see love hungry people tryin' their best to survive,
While in their head they dream of romance,
If they can keep it alive;

So, what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me 
What's forever for?",What's Forever For,1992
Michael Martin Murphey,"Let me tell you a tale and a good one I own of an old caballo a strawberry roan
I was hangin' round town just a spendin' my time out of a job and not earnin' a dime
When a stranger steps up and he says
I suppose you're a bronc rider by the looks of your clothes
I says guess your right there's none I can't tame
If its ridin' wild ponies that my middle name
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
He says he's a cayuse that's never been rode
The guy that gets on him is bound to get throwed
Throwed of that strawberry roan

Out in the horse corral standin' alone is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
Spavined old legs and small pigeon toes pair of pig eyes and a long Roman nose
Little pin ears and they're split at the tip a big forty four brand was on his left hip
So I puts on my spurs and I coils up my twine
Says to that stranger that ten spot is mine
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
I'll break him to saddle or break him my own
I'll ride him until he lies down with a grown
Bring on your strawberry roan

Then I puts on my blinds and it sure is a fight
Next comes the saddle I screws her down tight
Steps up aboard him and rises the blind get out the way boys he's gonna unwind
Shore is a broad walker he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings for to be on the fly
He's the worse buckin' bronco I've seen on the range
Turn on a nickle and give you some change
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
That sunfishin' critter's worth leavin' alone
There's nary a buster from Texas to Nome
Can ride that strawberry roan




",Strawberry Roan,1993
Michael Martin Murphey,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
""He's an outlaw loose and runnin'"",  came a whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip""

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip",Big Iron,1994

If it's a fence, mend it, if it's a dollar bill, spend it
Before if burns a hole down in them jeans
It it's a load, truck it, if it's a punch, duck it

Dressed alike from boot to hat
Could you tell which one was the real cowboy just from where he sat?""

The kid scratched his head awhile and then he said
""Well, there ain't no way to know""
The old hand grinned and then he said
""Kid, you've still got a ways to go

Michael Martin Murphey,"When the fiddlin' man came to our town
Sister dressed up in her prettiest gown
Momma told sister don't be hanging around
That no good fiddlin' nan

'Cause a fiddlin' man he ain't on the level
He'll fiddle like an angel act like a devil
Sister wouldn't listen she was a rebel
She liked that fiddlin' man

She went to the dance stayed all night long
Momma waited up 'til the break of dawn
Momma found a letter and said she's gone
Off with that fiddlin' man

Sister ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

So I bought me a fiddle and I got me a bow
Practiced in the woods where
Momma wouldn't know
Knew she'd never ever let me go
Off to be a fiddlin' man

And the leaves and the wind would dance and twirl
As I played for the rabbits and played for the squirrels
Couldn't wait 'til I played for the girls

Had to be a fiddlin' man
And late one night when the moon was low
I packed my fiddle and I packed my bow
Momma found a note and said ""Oh, no""
He's gone to be a fiddlin' man

And I ran off to be a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

Well then one night when I started to play
I saw a pretty gal looking my way
She was dancing with her brother
And I heard her day I like that fiddlin' man

Now her little brother was about knee high
Looked at the fiddle with a gleam in his eye
Said to me sir, I'd sure like to try
To learn to be a fiddling man

I said son, there's a whole lot a boys gotta know
Like chicken in the brier patch squawking at the crow
He said I don't care I just got to go
Off to be a fiddlin' man

So I had an old fiddle that I never did play
Sister winked when I gave it away
Ain't no doubt what momma's gonna say
That no good fiddlin' man

And brother ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

And his sister ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands

And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down his stall
In a blizzard he was lost

But there came an early snow
There's been a hoot owl howling outside my window now
For six nights in a row

Michael Martin Murphey,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",Wildfire,2012

Gives me the sweetest ""hello there""

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

Michael Maxwell & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

Michael McDermott,"Broken she had spoken, ""Here's a token of a lonely one""
The Idler stood beside of her, wonderin' whether to walk or run
""Rain"" he said, ""Tell me again, how you got your funny name""
She said, ""My house is the only one on that street,
I live at One South Rainey's Lane""
""Jesus, where is he when you need him"" Rain said and threw a penny into the well
""He's usually"" spoke the Prophet, ""behind you and your just too dumb to tell""
Rain said ""Who are you? You look like a drunken fool,
I wasn't talkin' to you anyway""
The Prophet said ""I'm no one baby, just like you,
but I can spot a joker coming a mile away....hey""
The prophet said ""You can turn and you turn, tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn, until you turn insane""
Aching hours and aching days with the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Prophet he was smokin' by the well runnin' his hands through his greasy hair
The Idler wasn't movin' he was gazin' into the stillness of the air
Rain she sat, adjusted her hat, and said somethin' as a city bus roared by
The Prophet said ""I'm sorry I didn't catch your name""
as he looked into the troubled oceans of her eyes
Rain said ""Forget it, now... it doesn't matter anyhow. I'm just a cat out on the ledge""
The Prophet said ""Melodrama suits you girl... I just don't think you've got the edge""
The Idler looked twice and he rolled his dice and said ""You know what would be nice?...
If you two would shut up for a while""
The Prophet said ""That's fine with me""
Rain nodded, she seemed to agree and the Idler began to smile,
Just like a child... The Prophet said,
""You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn in a baptism of flame""
The wind swept like a revelation with the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Idler said ""Indecision's, ruthless""
as he saw a toothless mother near her child engulf a beer
Rain said ""I've fallen so many times these days no one believes it or seems to care""
The Prophet said ""Is it all about the future is it all about the fear of livin' with the pain.
Or is it all about weakness, temptations curtain tricks or findin' someone to blame""
The Idler said ""I'm gonna call it a night I heard the sage was gettin' somethin' goin'.
Somethin' about russian roulette, on a blackjack bet, wine and blood will be flowin'.
and do me a favor, if you see the president tell him I got somethin' right here for him.
You two run along now, be careful, cuz you never know what kind of trouble two people could get in...remember
""You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn , but it's never gonna be the same""
The sky bled of dying dreams above the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Prophet and Rain walked to the water
Castin' stones into the night
They went down Rainey's Lane to Rain's place and made love,
and fell asleep after it was light
Rain woke to the sounds of the parade
The Prophet he was no where in sight
He left a note on the mirror sayin' ""Believe in the Rain and the Rain will be alright""
and she could remember him sayin'...
""You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn and never understand the pain""

Michael McDermott,"I wasn't lookin' for somethin' different
I was sailing slowly losing all control
I was goin' down in the dirty water
Deep into the middle of my soul
There like a streak of lightning, illuminating everything in sight
I surrendered to this senseless fighting
I surrendered to this senseless light
Over top of yonder mountain, over there where the rainbow ends
I took a drink from the holy fountain
Down around where the river bends
The further I followed this fallen path
The more I trusted in this fear
Then revealed in the aftermath
I didn't know who I was, what, or where

Just west of Eden, from Chicago to Gethsemane
Just west of Eden, the flowers smelled like tragedy
Just west of Eden

Communion came like rollin' water
Like a feast to a hungry beast
I knelt beside a ploughman's daughter
Whose thirst never seemed to cease
The gateway to the wicked led the lost under their wing
Silence fell upon this hopeless town and the bells of innocence began to ring

Just west of Eden, where Cain paved a pavement of sin
Just west of Eden, the trumpet wailed and the walls caved in...
Just west of Eden

Graced by the hours and the mindless traps
In which even the noblest fall
Love's longing flower brought humility unto us all
I stood engulfed by temptations smile
Searching for the only key
Reverent eyes fell upon my brow
While she moved in the air like poetry
Clutching on to this sword, I hold the names of all the men
I rip myself from this chord
Falling free to find myself again
I seize the darkness with a sharpened tongue
Then spit it out at last
I watch the lighthouse from the water
Beware of the coming of the past

Just west of Eden, crucifixions while the cities burn
Just west of Eden, the priest wailed and the poet yearned
Just west of Eden, insolence, prejudice, and cowardice are learned...
Just west of Eden",Just West of Eden,1993

I'm losing faith in everything and everyone but you
And still there's a bitter wind at night that cries
I don't know what it is but there's somethin' goin' on inside your eyes
Gonna leave it up to the angels

Time and time again I have been kept down,
By the same hands that lift me up
I found some strength in humility, found some comfort in this drunken cup
I turned to look for you but you weren't anywhere
Baby I'm reminded every time
Every time that bell rings, when I see certain things
Like that crazy heart you drew around your name and mine
Lookin' through these shades of grey, it gets so hard to see
But I'm ridin' on a wave in an ocean of uncertainty
Gonna leave it up to the angels

Baby, 'bout time that you choose, you gonna keep me
or you gonna turn me loose,
cuz I don't know what to do
You are the hand that fans the fire
You're the princess in the night of my dreams
You pushed me over the edge of desire
You are the passion at the heart of my screams
You are the stone I know someday could simply break my heart
You are the wind, you are the waves the could tear my lowly sails apart
And you tell me that you're feelin' so confused,
I've finally realized that the only thing that we can do is to
Leave it up to the angels

Surrender",Leave It up to the Angels,1993
Michael McDermott,"These evenings soaked with dreams hung on the lines of eternity
Stephanie and me we were caught in the light of reality
Fixed on a star like a candle hangin' above me
I'm never gonna stray too far from my savior in second hand blue jeans
It's a losing proposition when you're born on this block
Your eyes can't move and your legs can't talk
I can't even begin to explain the staleness in the air
We were just two lost souls gettin' wasted on a moonlit prayer

Conner and Des sat there so statuesque
On barstools leanin' forward lookin' in need of some rest
The accordion player with that jagged one eyed smile
Said ""I'm gonna take a little break and I'll be back in just a while""
While the old songs of Ireland disappeared into the walls
The bandit boy was carvin' his perversions in the stalls
Stumblin' to the street he walked away like he didn't have a care
He was dressed like poisonous sunlight wishin' on a moonlit prayer

Detroit Junior was in a mid life scheme
Another aberration to his real life dream
Slippin' and slidin' and a skatin' with the best
He was always on the corner with Connie in her Guatemalan vest
Tellin' tales of when he was a singer right before the war
He'll never get a chance to tell us why he kicked that chair to the floor
Some kids were at the quarry last night they said hey saw his ghost with fire in his hair
he was dancin' on the water.....
Under a moonlit prayer

There's balconies and barbers and a mistress in the door
There's a shrine of faith in the window upon the second floor
At the bottom of the hamper is where all of Earl's money is stashed
And the marks upon the wall mark the day since she's passed
The supermarket junkies are out on parade
With their nickels in their pockets
And their bottles of Chardonnay
Smashing those broken bottles and those bodies into the walls of despair
Disappearing down the alley
Lost in a moonlit prayer

Stephanie accept me just the way I am
For my love is one of limits and of things that I don't understand
In this nameless town and a tainted crown I'm a king without a throne
But I still get overcome with doubt in these nights all alone
I've been lookin' for a sign babe, I haven't got a clue
If you surrender your heart to me
I'll surrender mine to you
Imagine the two of us riding bareback in the distance on a silk white mare
We'll disappear into the sky
Chasin' a moonlit prayer ",Moonlit Prayer,1993
Michael McDermott,"Margaret quoted Whitman, and talked about the grass
She had bells around her ankles and spoke of a love that's sure to last
I knew of all her tragedy
I could see through her veneer
She said, ""I wish to Christ that somethin' for once would just seem clear""
With my life I swore I'd always defend her
Now She's gone and I need some surrender

In between the hours in which daylight fades away
These sad and lonely flowers trampled by decay
Can you understand how it gets so hard to stand
When everything you once held is taken from your hands
The colors danced across the auburn skies of November
Now I need some surrender


O come all ye faithful

Have you ever chased a rainbow or thrown darts up at the moon
Ever followed a fallin' star through the windows of your room
All the things that we believe in
Will all soon pass away
But I'm wiser than I once was
And gettin' more foolish every day
As a child I played on the streets of promise
With hearts of splendor
I'm older now, and I need some surrender",Need Some Surrender,1993
Michael McDermott,"Silence fell like healing, as I turned to shout
""Won't somebody up there please help me out?""
There's a dead end street around every corner I take
And the daylight displays my greatest mistakes
Hallucinations, body and soul
Each night I feel a little more less in control
She spoke of Whitman and the turnin' of the leaves
Lovers were made for nights like these

I've been waiting on the wonder, I dream does exist
They smile as I'm goin' under and claim I'll be missed
One step away from paradise one step away from pain
The seeds of despair bloom into weeds of shame
I've seen a fallen rainbow in white and black
I can feel that restless shadow stickin' knives in my back
But there's penance and passion, patience and peace
Lovers were made for nights like these

Now the cool majestic evening invites me to burn
I've been waitin' for tomorrow but tonight it's my turn
Intoxicated by the banter that the bluebird sings
By the visions of forgiveness when those church bells ring
I've seen the face of evil, sometimes it looks like mine
I've confronted all my weaknesses, down on my knees

Lovers were made of nights like these
Dreamin' was made for nights like these
Salvation was made for nights like these
Forgiveness was made for nights like these

Michael McDermott,"Time wasted waiting and time contemplating my life
I've been thinkin' and drinkin'
But it feels like I'm sinkin' tonight
Sing alleluia, but don't let 'em fool ya, it's just temptation
I act as if it doesn't matter, while I step out of time
To the clatter of generations

Like a sailor, I'm driftin'
Into the hungry mouth of the storm
Like an orphan I'm searching for a place that's safe and warm
Like a scavenger I'll find the pieces
Of our lives which have been torn
Like a sailor I'll surrender unto the sea
Like a fire I'll be reborn

Blue tide tumbles upon itself
The night would never mistake me for someone else
For it knows
Blue desert rumbles my formless track
""I'll be dead before I ever come back"" she told me
Driftin' so endlessly, movin' so friendlessly
Under the candlelit moon
If there's a chance for contact send some word
To the dark haired girl on Pine and Third
That I'll be comin' soon

Like a sailor in the dark hand of mystery
I'll search the sea and it's soul
Like a knight I'll guard your frozen gates
With a heart that burns like coal
Like a vagrant I stand bewildered for I know not which way to got
Like a sailor I'll surrender unto the sea
Like a fire I'll lose control

Marking the days, marking the years
I exit in dreams, dreams and fears of longing
Drifting into this mystical fog
I looked and swore I thought I saw the dawning

Like a sailor, I'm driftin'
Into the hungry mouth of the storm
Like an orphan I'm searching for a place that's safe and warm

Michael McDermott,"Gypsy nights, by the light of the lake I ride
I got a a hunger and the hunger well it's eatin' me up inside
I got a serpent in my heart, I got such anger that I just can't hide
Don't look now if you see me comin' around
I could swear that I'm lost, but it feels like I'm found
The nights begun to fall, I'm feelin' low but walkin' tall
Gonna stare down the face of defeat, gonna face my fears until they're beat
Somewhere at the end of the street

I waited for the letter to finally bring me some news
It never came and in that moment I know I'd have to choose
I've lost all the things that mattered, I could possibly lose
Don't look now, If you see me coming around
Don't look now, If you see me coming around
The sun has gone away, the disciples have been led astray
Our hero's have turned to cheats
But I'm gonna march to a different beat
Somewhere at the end of the street

I've gotten used to the things I know I should have said
I've gotten used to the horror I see nightly here in my head
I've gotten used to knowin' she's sleepin' in another man's bed
But don't look now if you see me goin' down
Don't look now yeah I'm just comin' around
Gonna rise up and find my way, gonna find myself a brand new day
Gonna stare down the face of defeat, find a love that will make me feel complete

Why do we look so hard?
Why do we ask so much?
In this world, it's sad in a way
How time unblesses love, and faith is lost

There's no more prayin' for saving grace to find us
No more waiting for conscience to remind us
There are few things meaningless as words
At the point of no return

Why do we want so much?
Can we be satisfied?
In this life how many times
Can we pass the promised land, forever lost?

There's no more prayin' for saving grace to find us
No more waiting for conscience to remind us
There are few things meaningless as words
At the point of no return

We are lost between faith and hope
Between heart and mind, between love and pride
Eventually, the day will come
When lies won't buy time
Tears won't bring hope
When there's no more prayin'¡­

Nowhere to run or do what we've done before
There are few things meaningless as words
At the point of no return

We are lost between faith and hope
Between heart and mind, between love and pride

Michael McDonald,"What makes a man
Believe in a brighter day
When his whole world is falling apart
All promise is fading away
What does it take
To turn his heart to stone

More than one life can hold

Sometimes it takes
More than we've got it seems
Something so close, so near
Even a blind man sees

If it takes a hand strong and mighty
To spin this world around
It takes the power of a woman's sweet love
To make a man hold on

What makes a man
Hang his hope on someone
To bring the light out of darkness
Makes him believe a change is gonna come

Something inside that just won't let go
Something so simple, so sweet,
Even a fool would know

If it takes a hand strong and mighty
To spin this world around
It takes the power of a woman's sweet love

To bring joy out of pain
To let sunshine through rain
To bring hope back to the heart
To bring together what's falling apart

Christmas present, Christmas past
Tumble down together like the snow, what a show

Now the snowman someone made is melting by the road side
On the wind, a serenade

On Christmas morning, you awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms, we watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet our love can be
All the memories coming back again each year on Christmas morning

Sentimental melodies surround me like an old friend
She spent the winter here with me
Silently we watched the seasons change
And they change so fast and fade away

On Christmas morning, you awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms, we watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet our love can be
All the memories coming back again, take me back in time

On Christmas morning, you awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms, we watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet our love can be

To outrun all the pain and fear
Turned to stone from my uncried tears
And now it's your grace I seek

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?

Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.

I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

And though they help me when you're gone,

Could have been me

Who knows where I'd be?

Round and round I've seen the up and downside
And I'm here to tell you that the secret of life
Is being thankful, thankful

You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide

I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Seems like it all goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

I'll fly a starship
Across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Who but I will find the place where hides away the sun?

Michael McGoldrick,"I took a stroll down the old long walk 
On a day-I-ay-I-ay 
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
On a grand soft day-I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 
Down the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl 

We were halfway there when the rain came down 
On the day-I-ay-I-ay 
And she asked me up to her flat downtown 
On a fine soft day-I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl 
 
So when I woke up I was all alone 
With a broken heart and a ticket home 
And I ask you, friend

Michael McGoldrick,"It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America

Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing
“Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more

Then fare you well, sweet Craigie Hill, where often times I've roved
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more

Michael McGoldrick,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Michael McGoldrick,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014
Michael McGoldrick,"There was a time when we?d be the last to leave 
Watching the sun come up while everyone fell asleep 
The music was always loud and I?d smoke and drink too much 
Until I?d fall in your arms and into your lovin? touch 
Now as the years roll by, time has reeled me in 
I?ve slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

Remember the days when we?d pack our bags and run 
Chasing a crazy dream into the morning sun 
Now as the twilight falls, I find I?m satisfied 
Watching the fire glow as long as you?re by my side 
Here in my heart it seems, time has passed me by 
I love you as much today as the very first time 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

I still want you the way I wanted you then 
If I could do it all over, I?d do it all over again

No pleasures here on earth I found.

Yes, many loved before us
I know that we are not new
In city and in forest
They smiled like me and you.
But now it's come to distances
And both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

I'm not looking for another
As I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner
Our steps will always rhyme.
You know my love goes with you
As your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes

Like the shoreline and the sea.
But lets not talk of love or chains
And things we can't untie,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

I loved you in the morning
Our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow
Like a sleepy golden storm.

But let's not talk of love or chains
And things we can't untie,

Michael Monroe,"Listen up here, I'll make it quite clear
I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear
Shake and bop, don't you stop
Dance like a maniac until you drop

I don't mind, I don't mind
I can run a razor right up your spine
What are you waiting for?
What do you think you were created for?

Show us, you care, show us you dare
You don't know what happened if you weren't there

Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Voodoo medicine, cast my spell
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Play that guitar just like ringin' a bell

Take it or leave it

Going for broke, rock 'til you choke
It don't matter if you drink or smoke
Speak through the beat, get up on your feet
Sweating like a hound dog, white as a sheet

Don't you be scared, don't you be scared
Everybody terrified, it don't seem fair
What are you waiting for?
What do you think you were creating for

Out of your seat, blind in the heat
Do the nasty boogie mama, stomp your feet

Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Go back to zero, take a pill and get well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Be a good soldier and die where you fell

Down every road you roam
And may sunshine and happiness
Surround you when you're far from home

And do unto others

Be courageous and be brave
And in my heart you'll always stay
Forever young, forever young
Forever young, forever young

May good fortune be with you
May your guiding light be strong
Build a stairway to heaven
With a prince or a vagabond

And may you never love in vain
And in my heart you will remain

Forever young, forever young

I'll be hoping that I served you well
For all the wisdom of a lifetime

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
