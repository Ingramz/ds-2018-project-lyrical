London Festival Orchestra,"Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there
 
Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there

London Festival Orchestra,"You tell me that you're leavin', 
I can't believe it's true!
Girl, there's just no livin' without you.
Don't take your love away from me.
Don't you leave my heart in misery.
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,
Breakin' up is hard to do.

Remember when you held me tight,
And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up I wish that 
We were makin' up again.

I beg of you don't say goodbye,
Can't we give our love just one more try?
Come on baby, let's start anew,

Girl, that was a one night fling
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me knowing how quick that this young'n be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jumatries 
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made (ooh)
During the escapade (ooh)
In the back of the Escalade (whoa) 
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve (uh huh)
But Shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breath (shit)
I usually don't get to rag um (uh)
But it's so real, I made the caddy chauffer hop out and get the magnums (uhhhh)
We getting close the Park of Meridian (uh huh) 
She pulling her skirt down (uh huh)

In the pent house blasting Mob Deep and some Bobby Brown (uh huh)
Do not disturb sign prolly woulda not be found (yeah)

She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot (ahhh) (uh)
At the same time she jerking and wiggling (uh huh)
Smirking and giggling (ha ha ha)

The way she working and fingering
She must have be a gymnast 
'cause the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments 
Ma I know you got centerfold measurement features (uh huh)
But after a night, it was a pleasure to meet ya (uh huh)

Before you were mine
And I was dying to be with you

The shadow you cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife?

I can't walk away
But how can I stay?
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall
I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life without you.

You weren't a saint
So what are these chains
You hold on both of us
You give it your best
But you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

Touch it, stroke it and undress it

For when love's gone, they'll lustre on

Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for

To take you away from all you know

She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine,
My valentine

And I will love her, for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly

And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there

Riding up in front of a hundred faces,
I don't suppose you would remember me,
But I used to follow you back in '63.

And I'm newly born.
You should see me dressed up in my uniform.
I work in hotel, all gilt and flash.

Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down.
Bell Boy! Carry this baggage out.
Bell Boy! Always running at someone's heel.
You know how I feel, always running at someone's heel.

Some nights I still sleep on the beach.
Remember when stars were in reach.
Then I wander in early to work,
Spend the day licking boots for my perks.

But when I look in your eyes,

Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea.

How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

London Philharmonic Orchestra,"This is a lovely way to spend an evening.
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening,
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A casual stroll through a garden. a kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a
Show
Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio
Some like to live for the moment, some like to just
Reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend. just give me one
Like this",A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening (Intro),1997

There goes my reason for living,
There goes the one of my dreams,
There goes my only possession,

Has been shattered by the closing of the door.",There Goes My Everything,1997

Those days of soda and pretzels and beer

Then lock the house up, now you're set

As cute as ever but they never get 'em wet

London Philharmonic Orchestra,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

In everything that's light and gay

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Steals across the meadows of my heart

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

London Pops Orchestra,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2000

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums

They were closer now Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

For some tender arms to hold me tight

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Mentre mi volto indietro e svuoto la valigia
Rimangono I capelli, le punte fragili
E gli occhi rossi rossi contro vento
Angelo mio saltiamo
In fondo al buio andiamo
Cadendo giù per sempre liberi
Angelo mio saltiamo
Spaccami il cuore piano
Portami ovunque senza andare via
Basterà
Abbracciami
Niente ci può sciogliere
Ancora I tuoi sospiri le notti a ridere
Lascia che sia la sera a farci illudere
Prima che passi questa notte invano
Angelo mio saltiamo
In fondo al buio andiamo
Cadendo giù per sempre liberi
Amore mio ti amo
Spaccami il cuore piano
Solo uno sguardo prima di andar via

Ci troverà la sera
Ci troverà la sera

Will his spirits future level ever heighten.

And touched him on the face

Threw her off the stage

Mingling with her tears

Had to carry her out that night

Wherever we go, we're going me and you

No matter what, now, we've got one another

Count on me to be a chum

If ya get an itch attack
I'll be there to scratch your back

Out though the oceans of sadness we sailed.
Venturing onwards through mystical scenes,
Blown on the whim of the wind that prevailed.
We had no reason to doubt the truth,
Driven by danger and discontent,
And the drums of youth.

Don't let the memory die,
Childen of the sky, heroes of the sea.
And as your life passes by,
Remember how it feels to be
Children Of The Sky

Searching on mountains of wisdom and fears,
Searching in forests of feathers and snow.
Travelling through valleys of secrets and tears,
Where only the brave or the foolish would go.
Watching for signs in an empty sky,
We never thought that the rain would fall,
As the years went by.

Don't let the memory die,
Childen of the sky, heroes of the sea.
And as your life passes by,
Remember how it feels to be

""Just the place for a Snark!"" the Bellman cried
As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
By a finger entwined in his hair.

The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies -
Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
The moment one looked in his face!

But the danger was past - they had landed at last,
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
Which consisted of chasms and crags.

He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
And bade them sit down on the beach:
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
As he stood and delivered his speech.
",Children of the Sky,1986
London Symphony Orchestra,"There was one who was famed for the number of things
He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
And the clothes he had bought for the trip. 

He had forty-tow boxes all carefully packed,
With his name painted clearly on each;
But since he omitted to mention the fact,
They were all left behind on the beach.

He came as a Baker; but owned, when too late-
And it drove the poor Bellman half mad-
He could only bake Bridecake -for which, I may state,
No materials were to be had.

I came as the Baker on this escapade,
I knead the dough, but I can't look after the bread,
The Banker does it instead,
And although I never feel afraid,

Somehow I know
It could be the single worst mistake I've ever made,
To come as the Baker on this escapade.",The Escapade,1986

All you fishermen and you fortune hunters,
Sharpen your harpoons.
Sing rhapsodies to the fickle gods that guide you,
Awake the brave adventurer that sleeps inside you. 
Before you VANISH AWAY LIKE MIDNIGHT SMOKE,
So that no signs or memories remain,
You might VANISH AWAY LIKE MIDNIGHT SMOKE,
And never be seen again.
You sailors, sail your stormy seas;
You gamblers, roll your ball.
All you butterflies and you ballerinas,
Dance until you fall.

When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk.

There's always been ethel:
Jacob, wake up! you've got to tidy your room now.
And then mister lewis:
Isn't it time that he was out on his own? 
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!
Keep them mowing blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

Sunday night, mr farmer called, said:
Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you
In the fire escape trade. come up to town!
But I remebered a voice from the past;
Gambling only pays when you're winning
- I had to thank old miss mort for schooling a failure.
Keep them mowing blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

London Symphony Orchestra,"Mad Man Moon
Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain?

Has the moon lost her memory
She is shining alone.
In the lamplight the whithered leaves collect at my feet

And a rose that is fading
Roses wither away
Like the sunflower I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to a different jellicle life
Memory, turn your face to the moonlight
Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Sunlight, through the trees in the summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun

Me and my drum",The Little Drummer Boy,1991
London Symphony Orchestra,"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
had a very shiny nose. 
And if you ever saw him, 
you would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer 
used to laugh and call him names. 
They never let poor Rudolph 
join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say: 
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"" 

Then all the reindeer loved him 
as they shouted out with glee, 
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, 
you'll go down in history!

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Meeting smile after smile

Have you been hiding?
Really - you were perfect
I only wish
I knew your secret

Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here

Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius

And it's not like you

All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.

Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

Stop and think of me

To put you from my mind

Just die?

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice",You Only Live Twice,1993
