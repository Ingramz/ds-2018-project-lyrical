Please push your panic buttons
Stop the press, it's those hypocritical judge
And condemning preacher, with pens behind the desk

We protest against their negative stress, time time
Time to get that shit off our chest, I know that violence

Go ask your mama, did you uncover your third eye?

Yeah and utilized my mental telepathy to get them away
From T-Lee and the rest of the posse

From the past or if I had a gat, I probably would blast
But livin' life like that, probably would not last

With quadro sounds

Who you? Or do they rule yer minds?

Of the chances that they be giving confidentiality
T-Bone gave a brotha love and he turned that shit into 10 gs

And now it's he who sails the seven seas
Left us in the studio trackin' our tracks
And we're getting freaky-o
Paparazzi got a satellite 24-7 on my home-o

Uh-oh, with a direct line that goes directly live to the
Tonight show, where they prep like chefs
Cuttin' and choppin' with their fake ass voice-o's

Yeah and supporting a low life sucka
Who stole a video tape of my brotha
And his wife without they clothes

Now they pack that shit in the publics nose
But ironically, my fellow peeps burn the trash up at our shows

Who sets the standards? Who sets the lines?
Who keeps feeding us ethnic separation tax
Levels n levels of occupation were all
Significant parts in this universal creation

Who sets the standards? Who sets the lines?
Who you? Or do they rule yer minds?

I'm not scared to face the wreckage of my younger ways
Every little thing you do
It's measured by the damage that it does to you

You can screw me around
You can swallow me down

All we do is get high
Guess I'd rather just save my breathe
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head My head

Everyone you think you know
It turned to something different only yesterday
All of us need to choose
It's easier to give in than it is to lose

They can blow up our head
They can leave me for dead

All is said is goodbye

Too weary to stand
I'm bound in the effect with the cause

There's nothing to plan

And they're still waiting for their lives to start

I'm not sorry
I don't think of you that often

How can I explain, that feeling remains
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
My visions were right, decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of mind
How can I forget, what reason is left
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
My visions were right, decisions were made

Neuer Tag, neuer Plan, den ich start’, doch vergess’ den Sinn
Hänge mit den Jungs in den Bars ab, bis wir dort die letzten sind
Drehe meine Runden durch die Stadt, um mal endlich wieder Schlaf zu finden
Egal, wie schnell ich fahr’, nein, ich schaff’s nicht, aus meinen Gedanken zu fliehen, denn
Alles, was ich wissen will, ist, wo und mit wem du dich triffst
Denkst du an mich oder kennst du mich nicht?
Jeden Morgen hoff’ ich, dass du neben mir liegst
Doch vergeblich

Denn glaub mir, so und zwar genau so fühlt sich mein Leben an
So, weil ich ohne dich nicht mehr kann, nein
Glaub mir, so, und zwar genau so fühlt sich mein Leben an
Zehntausend Bilder im Kopf erzählen mir nachts, dass du eben noch neben mir lagst

Das erste Date in den Nikes, die zerrissene Jeans
Unser Lied kam aus den Boxen, kaum Begriffe, die fielen
Lässig nicken zum Beat, Blicke zuwerfen und Feuer fang’
Gegenübersitzend standen wir vor einem Neuanfang
Nichts im Leben auf die Beine gestellt
Doch Metropolen errichtet in unsrer eigenen Welt
Die Euphorie nach dem ersten Kuss flieht mit dem letzten Bus
Und hinterlässt nur eine Symphonie aus Zigarettenduft
Mieser Luft, Melancholie und leeren Gläsern
Wir machten viel zu viele Fehler
Ich hab’ mir die Zukunft ausgemalt mit dem Rot deiner Lippen
Und trotzdem blieben wir nur bloßes Gekritzel

Denn glaub mir, so, und zwar genau so fühlt sich mein Leben an
So, weil ich ohne dich nicht mehr kann, nein
Glaub mir, so, und zwar genau so fühlt sich mein Leben an
Zehntausend Bilder im Kopf erzählen mir nachts, dass du eben noch neben mir lagst

Wann immer ich mir denk’ schlimmer kann’s nicht werden
Bricht es mein Herz, doch
Ich stell’ fest, dass ich lebe
Ich stell’ fest, dass ich lebe
Und wann immer ich mir denk’ schlimmer kann’s nicht werden
Bricht es mein Herz, doch
Ich stell’ fest, dass ich lebe
Ich stell’ fest, dass ich lebe, ey
Und wann immer ich mir denk’ schlimmer kann’s nicht werden
Bricht es mein Herz, doch
Ich stell’ fest, dass ich lebe

Aufgewachsen in der Gegend ohne Vater
In der Schule mein Benehmen ein Desaster

Ich kam von ganz unten, wo niemand dich sieht

Mach' auf Romeo und baller' deine Mama wie ein Panzer
Million Dollar, Junge, yallah, ich und das Finanzamt
Werden keine Freunde wie Obama und Osama
Jage Beute wie 'ne Mamba, keine Zeugen, Dicka, nada
Geb' einen Fick auf dein Gelaber, basta, basta
Sag mir nicht, dass du verliebt wärst
Will 'ne Hoe mit fettem Booty wie ein Nilpferd
Sie fragen, „Wo kommt deine Jeans her?“
Ich sage, „Kannst du dir nicht leisten, ist von Dsquared“
Es tut mir leid, ich bin nicht down-to-the-earth
An meinen Beamer darf hier niemand, nur ein Automonteur
Ich mach' mehr Lila als ein Bauingenieur
Keine Liebe für Verräter, bis ich draufgeh' wie Kurt

[Verse One]
Fresh up out the Testarossa
Still buzzin off that sticky green Cali doja
Last night had, way too many bitches jock
Mr. Player himself, gon' always keep it poppin
And stoppin you and yo' ability to come tight, mack like Dolemite
Sometimes you learn the hard way, but you gon' get it right
Keep listenin, discipline plays a strong part
The majority of these bitches ain't got no heart
enough to roll with the punches, hundred dolla bills and brunches
Comin home in somethin way tight that's scrumptious like
steak and lobster, dank from rastas
And we don't roll with nothin but, G's and mobsters!
Zenithes, Daytons, twenty inch chrome ones
Never know the feelin of a bitch 'til you own one!

Yeah we Bay riders, call us, murder for hire
Closer, than hittin home runs than McGwire and Sosa
We supposed to be, killin 'em off, hittin 'em off
with this old ill shit, givin 'em an overdose of this so real shit
So feel this, way down deep up in your liver
Give a, nig a chance for the alcohol to make you quiver
Still a, assassin blastin any nigga who think he can outlast
the master splash yo' ass in a, pool of blood
So ask the, nigga who done rolled up and got his, dome split
(Dome split) I don't give a fuck motherfucker wait 'til the chrome hit!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
They say you got to have heart
 I roll with dese niggaz dey mob figures and killas you niggaz feel us
They say you got to have PAPER
 Shit, cause life ain't long, nigga best to get yo' hustle on

[Verse Two]
A player's proposition got 'em wishin they was laced up
Perfect conversation plus my new just game I make up
Talkin bout, mash you got me bout it now I'm gettin dough
Dress in style every day, own many expensive clothes

Ay tell yo' potnahs they can be a part of all the benefits
Ay, pinky finger diamonds all the finest ain't no limits and
what we tryin to do menage-a-trois up in the rental then
you can make a move you never lose with a gentleman
All about my paper fettucini and lucciano
If we keep this pimpin right we movin into condos
Baby want to treat to play, she want to lace me
Dress me up from head to toe and shoppin sprees at Macy's
Ay, copped me all the flyest shit, like Tommy Hilfiger
Calvin Klein cologne just want to zone with a real nigga
We can do it live and go through all your wildest fantasies
Tell me yeah you want to be as freaky as you want to be

Niggaz is so fake and phony
Nine times out of ten they ain't Oscar Mayer beef they Lady Lee bologna
Speakin on shit they never did, soundin like a tweeter
Wishin they was a mid, ho you don't know you blowin out like an amp
Lickin mo' pussy than the post office lick stamps
Money over bitches, boy you don't remember?
Just kick back and sautee, nigga never simmer
Oh yeah you hoes you triflin too, haha

Into the woods,
It's time to go,
I hate to leave,
I have to, though.
Into the woods-
It's time, and so
I must begin my journey.

Into the woods
And through the trees
To where I am
Expected ma'am,
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house-

Into the woods

[BAKER'S WIFE]
Now you're certain of your way?

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
The way is clear,
The light is good,
I have no fear,
Nor no one should.
The woods are just trees,
The trees are just wood.
I sort of hate to ask it,
But do you have a basket?

[BAKER'S WIFE]
Yes, we do.
[BAKER]
I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these-
[BAKER'S WIFE]
Oh, shhhhh...
Now, don't stray and be late, alright?

[BAKER]
You might save some of those sweets for Granny?
Oh my-
[BAKER'S WIFE]
Just, leave it...
[BAKER]
She's a thief!

[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods
And down the dell,
The path is straight,
I know it well.
Into the woods,
And who can tell
What's waiting on the journey?

Into the woods
To bring some bread
To Granny who
Is sick in bed.
Never can tell
What lies ahead.
For all that I know,
She's already dead.

But into the woods,
Into the woods,
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
And home before dark.

[BAKER'S WIFE]
We have no bread...

[WITCH]
I don't want your bread...

[BAKER]
Then what is it you wish?
It's not what I wish,
It's what you wish.
Nothing cooking in that belly now is there?
And there will never be,
Unless you do exactly as I say.
In three days time a blue-moon will appear,
Only then can the curse be, undone...

[BAKER'S WIFE]
What curse?

[WITCH]
The one I placed on this house.

[BAKER]
What are you talking about?

[WITCH]
In the past, when you were no more than a babe,
Your father brought his young wife
and you to this cottage.
They were a lovely couple,
But not lovely neighbors.
You see...
Your mother was with child,
And she developed an unusual appetite.
She admired my beautiful garden,
And she told your father that
What she wanted more than anything,
In the world, was...

Greens, greens, nothing but greens:
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery,
Asparagus and watercress and
Fiddleferns and lettuce-!

He said, ""All right,""
But it wasn't, quite,
'Cause I caught him in the autumn
In my garden one night!
He was robbing me,
Raping me,
Rooting through my rutabaga,
Raiding my arugula and
Ripping up the rampion
My champion! My favorite!-
I should have laid a spell on him
Right there,
I could have turned him into stone
Or a dog...
Or a chair...

But I let him have the rampion-
I'd lots to spare.
In return, however,
I said, ""Fair is fair:
You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear.

And we'll call it square.""

[BAKER]
I had a brother?

[WITCH]
No. But, you had a sister.

[BAKER]
Where is she?

[WITCH]
She's mine now!
And you'll never find her,
Small price to pay for what
Else your father stole from me.
It cost me my youth, my beauty.
My mother warned me,
She would punish me
With the curse of ugliness,
If I ever lost any of them.

[BAKER'S WIFE]
Lost what?

[WITCH]
The beans...

[BAKER & WIFE]
Beans?

[WITCH]
The special beans...
I'd let him go, I didn't know,
he'd stolen my beans.
I was watching him crawl,
Back over the wall-!
Then bang! Crash!
A lightning flash!
Well, that's another story,
Never mind-
Anyway, at last
The big day came,
And I made my claim.
""Oh, don't take away the baby,""
They shrieked and screeched,
But I did,
And I hid her
Where she'll never be reached.

And your father cried,
And your mother died.
When for extra measure-
I admit it was a pleasure-
I said, ""Sorry,
I'm still not mollified.""
And I laid a little spell on them-
You, too, son-
That your family tree
Would always be a barren one...

[BAKER]
How could you do that?

[WITCH]
And when your mother died,
Your father deserted you.
Your father was no father so why should you be?

So there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes
And my garden thrives-
You should see my nectarines!
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens:
Don't ever never ever
Mess around with my greens!
Especially the beans.

[JACK]
Yeah, but why do we have to go to the next village?

[JACK'S MOTHER[
Because, everyone in this village,
knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks.

[JACK]
That's cheating!

[JACK'S MOTHER]
We're starving, Jack!
Don't you understand that?
Now, you're not to accept less than five pounds for her.
Are you listening to me?

[JACK]
Yes.

[JACK'S MOTHER]
How much are you to ask?

[JACK]
No more than five pounds.

[JACK'S MOTHER]
Less than five!
[JACK]
Than five!

[JACK'S MOTHER]
Into the woods,
The time is now,
We have to live,
I don't care how.
Into the woods to sell the cow,
You must begin the journey!
Straight to the woods
and don't delay-
We have to face
The marketplace.
Into the woods to journey's end-

[JACK]
Into the woods to sell a friend-

[WITCH]
You wish to have
The curse reversed?
I'll need a certain
Potion first.
Go to the woods and bring me back
One: the cow as white as milk,
Two: the cape as red as blood,
Three: the hair as yellow as corn,
Four: the slipper as pure as gold.

Bring me these
Before the chime
Of midnight,
In three day's time.
Tis' then the blue moon reappears.
Which comes but once each hundred years.
Just bring them and
I guarantee,
A child as perfect
As child can be.

Go to the wood!

[STEPMOTHER]
Ladies,
Our carriage waits.

[CINDERELLA]
Now may I go to the Festival?

[STEPMOTHER]
The Festival-?
Darling, those nails!
Darling, those clothes!
Lentils are one thing but
Darling, with those,
You'd make us the fools of the Festival
And mortify the Prince!

[CINDERELLA]
The Festival lasts three nights.
Surely, you could let me be there for one of them.

[STEPMOTHER]
The King is trying to find his son a wife!
Not a scullery maid!
We must be gone!

We'll take them with us.

You're not coming,
It's not safe out there.

[BAKER]
No!
I can do this on my own.
The spell is on my house.
Only I can lift the spell,
The spell is on my house.

[BAKER'S WIFE]
No, no, the spell is on our house.
We must lift the spell together,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

This stolen feeling
Amplified up through a busted speaker
Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,
Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow
He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Telmo

The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride
The timepiece stretched across a wrist
She couldn't care less cast aside

And there's a farewell note to mother
That will conclude ""Your loving Son""
""Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done.""

With puckered lips

Gathered like crows at the end of my bed

Think again, you can't fight

I'll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever has happened
The truth will free my soul

Lost in the darkness, try to find your way home
I want to embrace you and never let you go
Almost hope you're in heaven
so no one can hurt your soul
Living in agony cause I just do not know
Where you are

I'll find you somewhere
I'll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever has happened

When you stay low
Nothing happens
Does it feel right?

But I won't run
Have to stare it in the eyes

Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside

Getting stronger, coming closer into my world
I can feel that it's time for me to face it
Can I take it?

Your face, the rain in Paris, a distant bell
Now, inside my head, I still recall the moment
There was something that you said

And now, only now, if somehow I were younger
Nimble little fingers remember each melody
Melodies and days that I adored
Flower vases, cathedral doors

So long to sailin', safe by my door
Sunny place inside, comforting is all paid for
Too late for some change of mind, ohh, how would I ever find me?
Through rain and crying you were saying

Every heart is safe inside a place
That makes and shapes the changing
Make the change, sail away beyond the wishing star
Dreamers gettin' armor

Froze in the altitudes, toasting the latitudes
Old empty platitudes, tossing, turning, freezing and burning
Comin' around, comin' around, settlin' down
Comin' around, settlin' down

Ice cream and thunder, night beasts and butterflies
Most mornin's I'd settle for a little rain
I'll let it in and let it out, I'll blow it over, coda
Start all over again, makin' the bitter end a friend

Play that restless melody for me again
The one I've been, been so afraid of my sweet friend
Maybe the little refrain will whisper inside the rain again
Play the one with all the changes

Some lullabies for sleeping, a lullaby for weeping
And one to teach my heart to fight and win
Singing a sailin' song
Sun song, sun song

Now inside my head I still recall the moment
There was something that you said
I live inside the moment
Hearing something that you said

How still inside the moment
There was something that you said
Remarkable and wonderful
This something that you said

Every lazy afternoon
You?re my inspiration
Inspiration lights the way
Brings a sparkle to each day
Makes the dark clouds go away
Let us let the children play

Sunshine when you?re with me I can fly
Sunshine when you?re with me I can fly
Music is the reason why
People laugh people cry
Sing and dance and clap their hands
It?s how the whole world understands
Understands that we are one
Makes no difference what you?ve done
Or where you live under the sun

We are only human
Only human yes it?s true
Still the mystery is you
And the sky so clear and blue
Makes every day feel so brand new
Brand new day throughout the world
For all the little boys and girls
If everybody lends a hand
We can live together!

Sunshine when you?re with me I can fly",Sunshine (I Can Fly),
Metropolitan Boys Choir,"Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Hold thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

Metty,"Did you want the house, the dog, the white picket fence
The wife with three kids that helped your life make sense
The friends, petty trends, the mercedes benz
Keep the picture on the wall but its all just pretend
I thought I had it all figured out
But time's an empty hole and it becomes filled with doubt
Born a man, hopin to become the boy
Lived a life, only to be destroyed
From birth to death, the baby's first steps
Didn't affect the purest state that we have left
Best to start slow though pressure becomes past
The innocence is lost and ignorance grows vast
It all happens so fast when you're facin to the wind
You better count the chips before its time to cash em in
'Cause by then you'll realize that you've lost your drive
While workin a 9 to 5 until you turn 95
Sick and tired, know why its time to quench the fire
While speakin of how you felt you can call yourself retired
The live wire is dead, left quiet as kept
It's the birth, the death, the old man's last breath

(The old man said...this is how it all began)
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin' to quench our thirst
If I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin' life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin' to quench our thirst
And if I only know one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin' life in reverse

I am but a reoccurring cycle of light
Bound to this physical vessel until I reach the afterlife
And I might escape as my soul is undressed
I'll fall through all the answers that I saw this time press
Wait and find a different person staring in the mirror
Left to pull my life together from the pieces of a stranger's dream
A vague haze of past days last breath, sun sets, same story, new day, next scene
It's just bickering energy trading places
More like repeating different names and changing faces
The soul's eternal but the body soon wasted
Walk into the new light as the past is slowly faded
I'm falling from earth, return through rebirth
Carry body, open wings, a freedom far from all the hurt
So when my cycle's complete, I'll return to innocence
With nothing else to guide me but the traces of my inner sense

It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
If I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin life in reverse

There's a shooting star
Can you tell me
How I'm supposed to screw this up?
Add my tremolo
Likes to shine on yours and mine
All my emptiness
Is confined in metric rhyme
Make all your lies come true
I've been a liar too
Follow the things you need
Make your whole life complete

There's a puking girl trying
There's a puking girl trying
To defend herself
If spontaneously congealed into nothing

Idiot, you could have become you
There's a friend
Trapped in this dream, too

It's like I said before
Like in the notes you tore
Laying there on the floor
Until you knock the door
What did you hope to find?
Leaving it all behind

Should I say goodnight to you?
Really I tender feel for sin
Tell me honestly, am I adorable?

In her beautiful balloon
She's got hands
But she cannot reach the moon
Wish I was gay
Then I wouldn't have to play
All her games
Get her started

They can feel their whole world spin
Smoking plastic shards
They'll never be scared of me

And when they change themselves
They are never afraid of me

There's no time for you

It is not what it seems
You're awake in your dreams
With lithium you'll never be sad again
But you can't sleep with her

I hope you never come back
There's someone else in here
Please tell me why
Please tell me when

So they went to their car
I was lost in the crowd when I
Tried to find my way
Nothing else seemed to matter back then
Soft encounter
You amplify my emotion
No devotion
May sound wrong but is sounder

And I know you have nothing to say
When you look like you did then
There's no point in playing along
Is there now?

So they went to their car
I was lost in the crowd when I
Tried to find my way
Nothing else seemed to matter back then

Last encounter
A goodbye kiss from an old friend
Can't stay long now
My train is headed for somewhere else

When you're gone I envy the people you're with
Cause they're with you
Nothing's wrong
I've just been here too long to pretend

Feeling so small
You stretch out beyond me
There comes a time when all I'm feeling
Everything belongs to you
I was counting on you then
Close your eyes and think of when

So they gazed at the stars
And he told her his real name
Said it wasn't far

Lend my hands the wheel, you fly over me
Let it go now, you've been glad too
With my hand as the wheel you cry over me
I would like to be a child
Drown with me until you die

I thought I, I heard you cry
But it's just the wheels that ride over me
But then I, I know that's why
When I hear you sneeze

You're my dancing girl
I never thought you'd mean the world
It's why I'm here and why it seems reliable
So much time for us
There's nowhere here but there it was
The tale I had, and you became a friend again

I can hear them
They lost their sense and feelings
When you touch the wheel
I'll be alright asleep forever

Look outside
Tell your goodbyes

Why is that fire old?
A green light is a red light
In your dreams tonight
It's like a battle, battle.

But you can't stay
Tomorrow, streets, blank faces
Stare unwilling

Look outside
Tell your goodbyes

Open your eyes
Look outside
Tell your goodbyes

Don't need no more blood on my conscious
Cause even though I'm a soldier, I feel pain
Got a nigga paranoid around partners, I feel strange
Watching my back, cocking my gat, strapped at all times
Punishing motherfuckers, just for crossing that line
My only company is lonely mess, cause most of
These niggas be fake, and I can't stand phoniness
Can't even look me in my eye, before they burn me up
Two to the head, but it ain't that simple why yall can't turn me up dead
Best believe retaliation is a must, I'ma bust with fury
Look at me laugh at my competition, flashing my jewelry
Death ain't around the corner no more, he up in my face
Its only natural to try to steal him, and put him back in his place

[Chorus: x2]
In case I don't make it, I want to tell my people I love em
Wish I could jump up out my casket, and hug em
Just in case I don't make it, I hope they keep on jamming my songs
A military minded motherfucker gone

In case I don't make it, I want to tell my people I love em
Wish I could jump up out my casket, and hug em
Just in case I don't make it, don't cry now, I'm still in your hearts
I hope I get to go to heaven, my Lord

[Z-Ro]
In case I don't make it, I want niggas to know I never gave up
Z-Ro Vs. the World, and King of Da Ghetto is when I came up
People showing me love, people showing me hate
But I put the street with my business, and put mo' change in my safe
Special thanks to Eugene Brooks, it ain't another realer
Save me from being a drug dealer, but still a guerrilla
Death ain't around the corner no more, he up in my face
Only natural to try to steal him, and put him back in his place

[Mexican D]
A young Mexican brought up, in the wrong way of life
I had to do what I had to do, just to make it through the night
Hustling and robbing and killing, running the streets with no feelings
An aggravated motherfucker, that is ready as willing
So leave me alone, before I touch your dome
Or sending automatic 4-5's, to hit your home
Cause ain't no playing with me, I'm a down ass G
Showing no pity, from that Mo City

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
I've been going insane lately
Rolling with my gun off safety
Thinking everybody's out, to do me
Can't even relax, Mac 11 by the jacuzzi
Gangstafied, ever since then showing me love
And it don't matter where they at, nigga they gon hit you with the dub
But every night I pray to see, another fu-fu day
Even though sometime I fall off track, tricking with Mary J
Can't I get a piece of mind, everybody want to attack me
In the beginning they was strays, but now they busting right at me
Get up out my ride homie, don't want to ride with me now
If we rolling and I'm beefing, you can die with me now
Niggas around me dropping like flies, it got a nigga scared
Bullet proof and a automatic, come with making blood shed
So just in case I don't make it, tell my enemies fuck em
Wish I could jump up out my casket, and bust em

Glorious garments, you could get some style by taking glances
Red snapper, taken apart, put back together
Plated on some bok choy, fine fish platters forever (Yo!)

Purple label loafers, paying homage to the old school

I'm from Brooklyn, the reason why I walk with a bop
Same reason I don't fuck with the cops
My borough is thorough, if any nigga try to tell me it's not
I'll leave his face bloodied up, all covered in knots
We break bread at the table with made niggas and sip wine
And graduate from little niggas, now we living big time
I'm in a state of mind like Nas in his prime
That real New York talk, home of gritty and grime
Check it, I got the cleanup, Bronsonelli's batting lead off
Your mother's mouth is the place where I drop my seeds off
Hop in the Lamborghini, middle finger speed off
D's are getting P'd off, they're present, drop the weed off

Facelift the Team, Outdoors, where the Men's will be
Cop Killer Queens, the Upper East, we need a gallery
We unscripted, real drama, never no fallacies
I might party like a rock star for a couple of days
A couple strays tag along taking bumps of K
I keep a Buddha, little liquor, make me triple stack
Ideal wifey, small titties and a lot of ass
They call me Shaz, before it was my government
Unholy covenant, could never get enough of it

So pay attention when this rich bong's broken in half
And don't get left behind to choke on my gas
Ginger ale, juggle, Gen Pop, pockets intact
Prime king in the booth
I got it like that
But wait, audible react
Don't get caught in the trap
Real recognize real
And see it's part of the act
I break hearts, surround sound
With the sermon I spit
And leave behind a trail of permanent drips
In a room full of douchebags burning their lips
And bugging out about the right amount of water to mix
The freebase specialist, I dug him a ditch
Struggling with that addiction's a son of a bitch, fucko
I'll give you something to fix, get sober
You'll understand when you're older
The rap Al Bundy got the handicapped boner
Hot breath and the ice cold shoulder
So, give me room so my set can breathe
I'm from the Up East, plus I got connects in Queens
So how you want it?
Bent, skeed or straight blunted
My rap good like Deer Park in your stomach

Incredible Hulk, flash the villainous smile
He trying to stay young, he's never going out of style
Fresh to death like the corpse out the morgue
The new slang stay stiff, pause
No shirt when he record
Stay zoned, known to kick rap through payphones
Mighty Healthy set the tones
Spread the wealth through fly poems
Well known rap flesh
Keep it tight like close homies
And never known to flip like a Solid Gold Cody
Known to keep it scummy like a Sunday at Jones Beach
Known to keep it bummy like a Sunday at Centre Street
Known for having fun, blacking out, that's the motto
@toechamp, twitter game you should follow
US Weekly with the centerfold
A thousand tapes pressed up
A thousand tapes sold
Kids screaming out, ""when the mixtape coming?""

I slice the garlic with the razor, somewhere out in Asia

I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new

And other arms may hold a thrill

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

Mezzoforte,"When I was young I lived in a world of dreams
Of moods and myths and illusionary schemes
Though now I'm much more grown up
I fear that I must own up
To the fact that I'm in doubt of
What the modern cynics shout of

They say it's spring
This feeling light as a feather
They say this thing
This magic we share together
Came with the weather too

They say it's May
That's made me daft as a daisy
It's May, they say
That gave the whole world this crazy
Heavenly, hazy hue

I'm a lark
On the wing
I'm the spark of a firefly's fling

Yet to me
This must be
Something more than a seasonal thing

Could it be spring
Those bells that I can hear ringing
It may be spring
But when the robins stop singing
You're what I'm clinging to
Though they say it's spring
It's you

If poets sing
That when a hard sympathetic
It's merely spring
Then poets plights are pathetic
Though I'm poetic too

They say it's spring
For lovers, there's where the lure is
That evil thing
For which September the cure is
This, they are sure is true

Though I know
That it's so
That my fancy may turn in the spring

With the right
One in sight
One can find a perpetual thing

Did I need spring
To bring the ring that you bought me
Though it was spring
That wondrous day that you caught me

That it wasn't spring

Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like ""Well I oughta""
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles

Bound to go three-plat
Came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'

One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building

Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business

Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipple and tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life

Throwing emcees to the fire from out the frying pan

Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you
With well refined rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator

S to the U to the P E R-uh

Villain like trife kingdom wear and all my children
Plottin and it sure to pay ends
With some more mature women's and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue
Who grip necks of becks next to triple x
He just came before d followed the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap
Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Take it back to the ? leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin' joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin' me now respect get your fingers off the glass

I got my uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back

Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin' for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin' yo, big fat nigga bleedin'
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

I got my uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin' you see my gold fronts sparkin'
Ain't tryin' to hear what you dogs be barkin'
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin' Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three X-L kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Last seen headed towards a city in shanty town

Safe and sound mouth on the nipple panties down

MF Doom,"Keep your hoes in check
Super

I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around eight, she said, ""Super""
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like, ?Super?

Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring, super
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF Doom, he's like D.B. Cooper

Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off, she said, ?Niggaz ain't about shit?
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth, she can't live without it

And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous hoes shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It?s fun smackin? rookies, he is the super

Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown, skinned and always kept his hair low
Rumors has it, it?s a S-curl accident
Doom was always known to keep the best girls? backs bent

Some say it?s the eyes, some say the accent
A lotta guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her

No matter the city, she want me to do the thang, thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie, chitty, chitty, bang, bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D of 'All In The Same Gang'

Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat, chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the super

See most cats treat her like foofer
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the super
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything will be super

Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the super
Got the buddha, get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it

Listen here, scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
Which will have you under some type of spell, crying, ?Dag boo?
Her name on your back in her tattoo

Whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick
Don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick
You don't want her, don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
And be a father to your child like the super

He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posin? nekkid for real
Better yet, get 'em for the check off the record deal

Find out where he keep the tek and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let 'em know how you feel
And while he's runnin down to All-Star Weekend to ball
I'm comin with the you-haul, super

Super, super
",Hoe Cakes,2004
MF Doom,"I get no kick from champagne
Their alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There is only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all their MC's and drink 'em under the table

Like it's on me, put it on my tab, kid, however you get there
Foot it, cab it, iron horse it, you leaving on your face forfeit
I crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him get off it and a bunch other more shit

Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough

The group been soft, first hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere, it read
To wide load, this yard bird taste like fried toad
Turned love villain take pride and code words

Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat, to dine by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skezzer eye

And squeeze her thigh, maybe giver her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call him super when they need their back or plumbing fixed
Powers only one left, the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three

A hood tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, what you doing G?
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me

Looser than a pair of Adidas, I hope you bought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
Dude, can we do this thing again no matter how be blinging

You do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Telletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet

He plots shows like robberies
In and out, one, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shootie, nobody move, nobody get hurt

Bring heat, like the boy I'm going to war
Came in the door and everybody on the floor
A whole string of jobs like we are on tour
Every night on the score coming to your corner store

MF Doom,"Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without sayin a producer's name, all over the track
Yeah I said it!  What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that english
And knock it out before we pour
That sure shot more rock co.kane flow

From the top of the key, the 3 Villain
Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn
Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard?  Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from bein hot
It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!
And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin
Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura
Or I can hold her

The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sippin broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing

A real weirdo with a bug-rear flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be singin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparkling jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wick's lit

Exit stage left with the cash, gone took it
Off like a koufi, the fit was a bit doofy
He tried to get screwy, with that ""two for you,
One, two for me, G,"" cut the cranky attitude
Wet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude
Whether you's a rapper or dang sanger
Once you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger
With a new crew keychain and street name
What set do he claim for fame, peep game
Just to keep feta and stay dip
You need it like a letter or better a getaway whip
This old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted

For the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity
Tony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery
Who is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats
Oh no! the fans cry for the mask back on
Told 'em ""Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn""
Few years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived
He'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron
The other half water look like alien science
In the summertime, you can see the face boil
But the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil
Mad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?)
I get stuck 'cause my brain all numb
Like I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's
Aquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly

MF Grimm,"Her name is Life, loyal, would never do me wrong
With the best move she was a beautiful song
A schoolgirl, mastered biology
Taught me everything, she holla hollla at me
Beyond vision, totally internal
Trees, bees, birds, words, verbs, nouns
Took walks in the park
She was sweet but at time hard knock

Til I met Death, she took the last breath of me
I met her through her cousin Sleep
To the left, to the right, she went both ways
Yes chasing her was chasing Amy
Took me to the edge, told me jump with her
I was hypnotized so I jumped with her
Cause I wanted her, confronted her, between the sheets
I messed with her Life paging me want me to mess with her
Don't feel like being stressed with her
She wants to walk in the park, I want to run the streets
I'm acting real cold, she's giving off heat

She rather see me get a diploma
I go check out my homegirl Coma
Coma and I have a cool relationship
She give keys to the crib and don't ask me for shit
Sack the fridge for me to drink and eat up
I'm skeeming like a demon on the couch with my feet up
Pay-for-view championship bout
Main event didn't start so I slipped right out

And called Life from the pay phone she's chewing me out
She sensed that I'm cheating the way I'm moving about
A nigga from the streets is what you trying to be
Your sleeping around, stop lyin' to me
Life, you know you act like a bitch right?
Then we just die, that's why I get high
And she said my love you try to deny, but please give me a try

But Death's a fiend, public places having sex with me
The streets are watching us, stay hard when she's next to me
We don't love these hoes before we lust
She introduced to her girlfriend and off I bust
Menage-a-trois we must constantly
Together fuck the world criminology is what she taught to me
Feels so nice giving blow jobs in her mouth is glaciers of ice

I act up cause I'm backed up with virginous Life
Won't give it up until I make her my wife
Life want it all, I just can't win
Traveled back to Coma house and then I slipped back in

Coma love me ladies sexy as can be
She looks into my eyes and asks what's troubling me
Powers beyond are humbling me
Gotta pick one so which one will it be
Women like Death is all around the world
She said Life is wonderful a hell of a girl
She wants to share her world give you all she can
Death's a freak slept with every damned man
Life got your back she's picking you up
Death packs the gat straight sticking you up
Life can't live without you she's biggin' you up
But put Life after Death cops are diggin' you up
Life is precious she's one of a kind
Choosing Death over Life you lost your mind
Life is the one for you no doubt
Main event was over so I broke the hell out

And called life back how silly I've been
I took her for granted when she's my best friend
Nothing lasts forever one day it will end
But I remain loyal until then
Mentally strong she would carry me
Got down on my knee Life marry me
I feel so blessed because she said yes
Now I gotta break it off with Death

Tell her the right way don't provoke her
Cause how she livin' mi vida loca
I spoke to her, but she didn't listen
Straight face like poker
A joke to her
She think I'm bluffin'
But I'm not, things gettin' hot
As I leave her spot
She pulls a gun out
And says it's not over

Fatal attraction actions alter my mind state
Meet your fate cause up goes the death rate",Life and Death,2002

[Verse One]
Story 'bout retarded nigga, went against his main nigga
Started rollin wit other niggas, knew they wasn't feelin niggas
Niggas had beef wit niggas, now he breakin bread wit niggas
Jealousy and envy, money leave ya dead nigga
Clip in ya head, throw ya in the bathroom
Inside tub, chainsaw rub
Cut down to nubs, bag like work
Thought he was my man, he was a motherfuckin jerk
From his face wipe smirk, flip the script kinda lurk
But I'm a gravedigga nigga, so I put 'em in the dirt
At first shit hurt, reminiscin' when we laugh
Havin' fun bustin' guns, but yo fuck it that's the past
Had to kill his ass, lose cannon want to scheme 
Free agent over cream switchin' teams
Can't let him slide, time to take this ride
Popped up the trunk, throw 'em inside

He flipped (oh yes he did)
Went to war against his click (oh yes he did)
Even though to us it did really hurt
Still we got together and we tied 'em up (oh yes we did)

He went to war against his click (oh yes he did)

He flipped 
He went to war against his click (oh yes he did)
Even though to us it did really hurt
Still we got together and we chopped 'em up (oh yes we did)

[Verse Two]
Died on the tracks like the rat he was
Before we blew his brains out, he screamed out ""WHY?""
Didn't tell 'em shit, let 'em find out
From his maker, why he was aired out, FUCK 'em
Cobra Commander, strip the life
Metal Face lay loss,  ain't No Snakes Alive
Rakim said, no mistakes allowed
So we corrected 'em, by dissectin 'em

Went to war against his click (oh yes he did)

Time to load the clips, then we take 'em to war. 
Niggaz want to flip, then we take 'em to war. 
Break a nigga proper, then we break him some more. 

I represent the murderers and felony offenders,
Who either bought time out, to get these legal tenders.
(Surrender!) Nah, I'm goin' out with a bang, nigga.
Fuck Pataki, I gotta do my thang, nigga.

Brains left in particles, fragments and fractions.
Grimm, the money stacker, heat packer.
I'm lurkin', I'm waitin', attackin' like a linebacker. 
Fuck what you heard, crime pays.
And always, unorthodox, I hold my pistol sideways.
We kill crews, hearts go numb,
And if retaliation comes then yo, fuck it, it just comes.
(Yo, who you?) I'm Dr. Death, motherfucker, ever heard of me? 
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, time for surgery.
I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me,
'Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly.

[Chorus x 2]

Since I murder for hire, rapid fire's what I require.
Makin' niggaz perspire, so send a message through the wire.
'Cause violence is contagious, it got me bustin' gauges.
The '95 Larry Davis, and I'm wettin' niggaz for wages.
Queens is the home of one, the known felon,
And ain't no tellin', when I'm a crack your fuckin' melon.
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips.
Leavin' niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips.
With the pound-seven, I be creepin', rockin' niggaz, while they sleepin'.
Shots repeatin', leavin' faggot niggaz leakin'.
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin' to Zion.
'Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion.
Word, son, niggaz be collapsin', cause my weapons is
Ready for action, makin' your heart catch contractions.
In the underworld, shootin' gallery niggaz lose calories,
'Cause my salary's based on fatalities.

[Chorus x 2]
 
Here I come to get some motherfuckin' wreck, but first I gotta, 
Um, vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set.
So let a motherfucker move a muscle.
When I tussle, they'll be piecin' niggaz back like fuckin' puzzles.
'Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin' mad noise, a bad boy.
When I was younger, always carried guns, I never had toys.
Grimm, gimme the infrared, they see me, and I'm puttin' red dots
On niggaz foreheads, to makin' motherfuckers indian.
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder. 
'Cause I put holes in my beef, like fuckin' White Castle burgers.
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo' pound.
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down.
I see 'em, he's comin' out the fuckin' Coliseum,
And hopped into a B-M, shit! 
Put in my clip, and then I dipped into the ride that my man had, 
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide.
I'm rainin' on him, (faster nigga.) oh yeah, we're gainin' on him.
(Oh shit, he's with somebody else.)  Fuck it, put his brain on him.
Boom, boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat.
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver.
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin' up a cigarette.
Bang, bang, I left the other nigga wet.

Give me the ice, and I'll show y'all bustas how to skate
Give me the time I'ma consume and straight cultivate
Give me the money to stage and the mic and I'm straight
I can tell you ain't hard, y'all bustas soft
They find a neutral spot, they let go loot so I'ma go off
I don't imitate styles, I got flows
Now watch the special delivery to you motherfucking hoes
Check one two with the mic, check the game
Check the handling when I step to change a lane
Check the straight knot on them hoes I be checkin'
Now check ya playa status from the chicks I'm collecting

Now put a cap on that bullshit y'all talkin' bout mister rapper
I'm fed up to here with that ??? so I'ma slap you
Saying gangsta rhymes and doing whole things that don't mix
Uh huh, you about to get caught up in the mix
I'm from St. Louis, the clean town was the hood
Disrespect, watch me make it understood
Ya better have somebody to call twelve
I'm pissed off and I'm about to raise hell
And I won't bite my tongue for none of y'all

And the hoes hooked up to the hydrant in case you spread, no doubt
You bustas through, we coming through

We bout to drown, we murder bound
Get it together cause tonight it's going down
I can't stop, I can't quit
So one of y'all end up getting a wig split
It ain't nothing you can do to take us under
Cause we warriors, playas, soulja killas, and hater hunters
Y'all just unchained the wrong clique

I hear them loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

As my, world turns
The heart beats
Not only in my chest
But the heart of the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre Beats
I am from the city of people who came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Exception shows me as the dead man walkin',
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family 'cause I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, the top
Let 'em have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

Telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am invincible, oh oh
Was telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am Invincible, oh oh oh

Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged out
Everything I write is played out, like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes on the wall but they don't know the past
Even if I told them at all they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams
And pull on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
It's just one, til the day come like Rocky's movie scene
And I'm on top of the world, look up the screen like this is me this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself to the pills
And you cannot mess with me still, seen the boys and they winning
Underdogs of the year Cleveland boys in the building
What the fuck is a ceiling I'm taking us to the top,
And when I leave the whole world drops, Lace Up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear

Or If we ain’t gon' talk at all
Make a nigga have to, talk with the 4
That's the only language you know
There you go pop, pop, pop, Now there you go
And I hate that I can see snakes clearly
They don’t even try to hide, it’s like they be tryin' to get near me
Most of y'all don’t hear me, it’s like I’m talking to myself
You niggas is so dumb got me feelin' like I’m talking for my health
It’s not like I’m talking for the wealth 
'Cause there ain’t no money in the truth
Shit! I live this shit for real
Y'all make it up in the booth
Till a nigga lose his tooth over something he didn’t plan on
Wasn’t prepared for, really couldn’t stand on

Fuck it, turn the cam on, tie his feet and his hands up and watch him
I’ll be back up with that heat to get his tan on
Now that’s for fucking with me
And that’s for my dog
This because where you're going you're not gonna need that arm
The street’s is talking, Uh oh, here they come
Thirsty for that blood, Red rum, red rum
Do you know how it feels to be so mad you would kill?
Or to be so trapped when you scream your throat cuts like jagged pills?
And whenever you close your eyes everything inside you dies
And all the ‘high’s, crimes, and lies’ come alive muthafucka

I swear that I can feel 'em fucking with me
Every night I feel 'em fucking with me
Please God tell these demons stop fucking with me
Every God damn night I feel 'em fucking with me
Why? Please God",D3mons,2012
MGK,"I'm humble because I know what it feels like
To be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me

I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around now I'm somebody

Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me cause I'm nothing like 'em, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he’s proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated
When inspiration, motivation was needed
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'ma keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listen in to witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirlin'
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive, head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

I remember thinking I would rather die
Than go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I’m ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs
Everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back in forth, on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y’all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimpin’ on everybody and certain motherfuckers 
That want to get in my circle I tell 'em naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy
Naturally, and I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s, fuck ‘em I don’t even botha
And who knows what’s next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Mid-West, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level
Wherever you wanna go, everybody put they hands up I’m ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)

Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""

From the back streets
To the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes
Whoever would've imagined lace up
Could've got me to the finish like track meets
And when everybody’s hot, I’m past heat
And if I don’t need the fuel, don’t gas me
It’s been a long time coming
Since 100 words and running
Mother fucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then u know we gotta have it
Don’t nobody ever snitch, get pinched? You forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby’s mother 
Never’s gonna know his daddy
Tragic

Why’s the government gotta lie to get money?
Why’s the federal reserve gotta take from me?
Why we even fighting for another country?
Have u seen my city mother fucker we hungry!
Representing for the middle of the map 
Even though me and mine are coming from the bottom
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
Do u really think the Notorious Big would believe these guys?
All these internet thugs that the the media finds
You wanna talk about grind
Look in encyclopedia what name is in it I bet u see mine
Mother fucker this Kells
Skinny boy six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still I came out on t-o-p
This is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had on him was his headphones
So he picks a song
And he turns them on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape
In the kick in the bass

And live for the moment not by the past

I couldn't fit in like a bad shoe
I was always to square, too cube
Too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high school hotties
Now I'm too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The schools most popular lame
No friends
No style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bed, fell asleep and never woke up again
Yeah, and my last prayer
Was don't ever let me end up
Like the people that's down here
Cause the ones that fear change
Be the ones that don't care
Look at themselves
And see somebody else in the mirror
But you could always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style

I fired myself
Found a job myself
Established my name

I wish I could see their faces
When they heard your boy spitting
Wish I could know what they thinking
When they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing
That I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they wishing they wouldn't have said that shit
I came out of a dying city
Brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do
I did 'bout twice
Multiply that by the battles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration
Bitches more ice
Make a toast to the underdogs
Toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes
Used to talk reckless
But now I push Benz's
And rock Rolex's
Came from the city
And until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side still with me
And that's how we living
Ya mans don't change
Look its still the kid
Still cant tell me god damn thing

Now they say home is where the hate is
Pulling up, “Hi, haters!”
I know, I’ve been on a hiatus
Caught up in the lights I've been blinded by Las Vegas
Ain’t it ironic before I was twenty one
I put my future on the table and I won
See they told me, “Life’s a gamble”
Now this is my casino
Made sure my fellas good
Now I’m Robert DeNiro, sipping Clicquot
With the girl that held me down from the beginning
My team throwing up L’s
But it’s funny cause we winning
A million talked down, soon as I rose from the bottom
But opinions assholes now, everybody got ‘em
So they ask me why I do it
I do it for the streets
Heard momma got out the grill
Man I do it for the grease
Man I do it for the five pack of Hanes wife-beats
That I wore like everyday to show my brand new ink
Shit I remember working jobs, just so I could hit the dance up
Never have a date, so I really didn't dance much
Couldn't buy my own, so I just borrowed my dad’s tux
Told him, “Keep the loafers” kept it gully with my black chucks
So you can keep watching the stars
But me I wanna be ‘em
And I just beat the odds
I guess we can call it even
Cause he the underdog

To living lavish then a mother fucker

We got stories for day man, for days
They just gotta listen
Hey slim
And if y'all don't know, that's like my best friend right there
But anyways
It's safe to say we're on our way man
'Bout time though
Do you remember when my dad kicked me out like right after we met
And I showed up at your house the next day with a U-Haul
Like hey, you wanna move in with me?
Matter of fact nah nah
Do you remember the time we had those two girls over
And Dub called like ""Yo these dudes tryna jump me up here at the Eth""
Oh that's when we called the store across the street from our crib the Eth
'Cause it was on a 100 and 30th
But anyway though man, we left those girls, sitting with the door open
Sprinted to the store ready to fight
And this fool goes like ""ahh got y'all I was just playin'""
Damn I still wanna whoop his ass for that shit.
Nah nah nah matter of fact,
You remember when you wanted to buy your first keyboard,
So we went and gathered up spare change, like everyday.
And walked into that bank with that heavy ass bag of nickels,
And they were looking at us like ""what the fuck?"" 
We too grounded to be Hollywood man
This about as Hollywood as I'm a get

Hold up
Okay I heard they want the classics
My life’s a movie like the Truman Show without the cameras
They look at us like we a couple Boyz N Da Hood
Four Brothers till the end like them boys in The Wood
So I Light It Up, for them Friday Night Lights with the team
In The Notebook, holding my Requiem for a Dream
I was Superbad in the class I just Dazed off
So I played sick and lived Ferris Bueller’s Day Off
Back in Coolie High, students used to nickname us The Goonies
Every night we blacked out, shit they should’ve called us roofies
Get out of bed Half Baked, roll another doobie
So many snacks up in my house they call the crib Scooby
Blowing oowie man I swear this As Good As It Gets

Couldn’t even sell one zone

We ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here, prayin for a rainbow
To lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to

Never gave a fuck if we went gold

Real EST mufuckas dont break up
Real family grows old, Real EST mufuckas representing

And Fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the Eastside

Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets

While my first born in here trying to get sleep

Try telling me that u can’t make it up
Out the city 26 dollars to multi-mill’s

Looking at the house of pain
I’ma runaway from the ones that pay me hopin

You set me free
Just look inside your speakers

Uh, there I go
2 clicks north of the bronx
Whoever thought she would found love in a stereo
2 headphones and a box
She gets me up
Every morning on the walk to school
She ain't worried bout these other little kids
Cuz she told me
Everdyday they sayin something new
And you always got the illest kicks
Boom Boom tat
And she takes me out
Just so the block can see
Told me she wanted the world to know
So she makes me loud
Now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers
And she's all mine
And even though her parents don't like me inside
Whenever her daddy comes around
We just hide
Cuz she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why
I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Yeah, and she loves my sound
It's why I'm always around
One of the most popular girls
In the class
Could... attract the crowd
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cuz at all of the parties
I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song
She might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on
Play the music soft
Yeah so that's what I do
Anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up
Cuz I know my cue
But when they gone
I'm back at it
She loves this song
So I blast it
Dad gets home
I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch
Like gymnastics
Uh and Imma always be there for you
You just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So

So turn me on

And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Uh, and she gets older
But I stay the same
And as she grows up
Her opinions change
Now she's off at college
W- are the ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then
I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin about us
Waitin for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch
And get that rush
But I'm not what she needs
So I power down
Then right at that moment
I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free

And there you'll find me

I ain't afraid, knowin’ shit’s gotta change
One day it’ll never be the same
Just look into my heart you can see the grind
Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldn’t see the sun
Son raised, though daddy wasn’t home, word
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
I will not lose, Hov told me that
Dreaming bout a moment that’ll change my life
I don’t never wanna wake up, turn off the lights
Gotta let it burn, I’ve been ready to ignite
I said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go

I never waited on a miracle

There’s no rules in the life we choose
I gotta ride for something, gotta die for something
Say you only live once, well I keep it 100
Mo money, mo problems keep on coming
Tryin, a nigga go back but these niggas keep frontin
Right now everything going right, it could fuck up tonight though
Said nothing’s impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go

I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

I ain’t afraid, I’m already dead
I just don’t know when we goin
It’s crazy how the devil gets us when we heaven-sent
My hands already red, I lost so many men
Heavy is the head that bares the crown that I’m wearin man
I was a loser just tryna fit and I let em in
But those were school days, I grew up, now I’m on Letterman
I never thought that a song I wrote in a minivan
Would ever have the impact I’m reading inside these letters man
Dear Kells I heard yo story and felt it man
Your voice inspires, I feel like I can do anything
By the way, I sent you something from my brother
Open it up, a razor felt, it was a cutter, damn!
What if you were me, in 2003?
Rap was just a dream baggy jeans, burning blank CD’s, feed em to the streets
Would you let adversity as you are, come for money
Guys you all realize everything you need’s inside you

I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here
There ain’t no miracles
I’m not afraid of the impossible
There ain’t impossible round here
There ain’t impossible, no

I never waited on a miracle
There ain’t no miracles round here

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right!
Aye Doug, aye Dray, aye Earl, you know it’s all year right? Hah!
I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City
The night before I gotta turn my second album in
Higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka
With my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago
We were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday
And the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals
And you know, the crazy part is
Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York
I think she had to some work some shit or something like that so she couldn’t go
So we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about
And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended
So I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch
So you can drive in case we get pulled over""
'Cause we got pulled over the last time we went there
But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive
So cut to like 7 and a half hours later
I pull over in this emergency lane
And right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom!
This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us
Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in a ditch
Like 15-20 feet away from where we just were
The car was totaled, the windows were smashed
It was cold as fuck, it was raining outside
But we were, we were actually okay
I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit
He ended up being alright
But our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car
And now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey
So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan
He comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway
I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash
And could’ve died a couple of hours ago
But I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man
I’m not feeling this record label shit
And a, we drove back to Cleveland
Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know
I'm on a shit ton of vicodin 'cause the doctors at the hospital
You know gave us something 'cause we got into that car accident 
And Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like
""Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now
""I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds""
Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise 'cause this dude named Byron
Who ended up becoming my manager later on, took this video I had called “Chip off the Block”
Over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre
And Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff
So I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear
“Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you""
I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it
And sometimes that's all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean
I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Feel that, uh

Sorry, but I'm scared at looking

Trying to convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
'Cause people hated on me, how can I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?

While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping 
Wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?

MGK,"I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just is as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catchin' up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?
They told me fight night I'm supposed to lose
Just 'cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love

You can give up like they tell you
Stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
But I'm tryna tell you, fuck what they tell you

(I think we, uh) And in these dark times
As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It’s important to know we’re not blind
We see the truth through blue and dark eyes

Am I loud out there?
I mean, do you really hear me? Huh?

The definition of greatness
Is in the making you're witnessing the amazing
Blame me if you awaken you've been sleeping too long

You're probably unaware
But I'm here to let you know it, take a listen
Shut the fuck up for once and just enjoy it, real Music
Bullshit on the daily? Try to avoid it
Your life's ass, similar to a toilet huh?
You see me living chasing everything I wanted, huh?
Forever blunted, ready for whatever coming, huh?

The cash in keep the 'vette running
Stop sign? Bitch I run that

Like why you mad at me? I’m just out here getting faces
Irritated with these bitches and their crazy ways, when
All I wanted was some head on a lazy day, damn
(Where you been?) On the other side of the map
Taking naps in first class getting paid to rap paid off
Having jobs since the seventh grade
Got laid off ever since I've been self made
See my homie wanna see me win
Fronted me some bands told me ""Youngin go and get it in""
He believed in it more than I, So I gotta ride
Down to die for my dawgs, yep, EST 4 Life
Opportunity took advantage I gotta manage
Even when it's hard, hard times, yea, what would I be without it?
The struggle made me tougher, forcing me to hustle money in demand
Fuck fame ain't nothing but trouble dawg
I'm never perfect, I got flaws like a lot of ya'll
Who be criticizing on the low, hating on ya boy
Ya'll defensive maybe that's why I offend you
When I dribble through my legs in the mall when it's time to ball
Life on the edge, hope I never fall
Though you pray I do, what a shame
But I maintain shooting for the stars

Summer day
Bobby and his girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watch
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading
“I’ll be home tomorrow. Love, Bobby”

Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit
Damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!""
""Wake up!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his
Summer day,
An entire family died on that summer day
‘Cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay

Stole it straight from California homie what do you got on it?

Couple grams of Aunt Jemima

Pulling up to Grandma's, I smell bacon, eggs are scrambled
Hoppin' out then ol' boy ran up my dog grabbed the MC Hammer
Blammer blammer make him dance
And watch him run up out their sandals

I’m bringing a Grammy back to the city this is the anthem
Have P. Diddy on St. Clair dancing, Kells
Used to ride RTA a dollar fifty every meter, food
Wasn’t guaranteed I stole my meals out of Arabica, speakers
Blasting my own shit, bow tie on the jet on my grown shit
Court side at the game with the owner
And sell the same arena out when I’m homesick
God damn I'm a fool

Couple hundred bitches in the pool
And out of a couple hundred rappers I am the truth

What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot
His mother's make up smearing on my arms, cryin'
Cause' I'm the only son that she's got now that he's gone
What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal?
You telling me if we couldn't shoot a ball
Our lives still got shooting involved?
And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?
But fuck it this is life
Deal with it or get dealt with
I'm in my room smoking alone like I'm selfish
Cause' some days the sun's hard to face
Dad turns his son wears his face

But look closer see the heart of a lion
Sticks and stones couldn't damage my bones harder then iron

Would the people I used to be friends with never left?
What if making a name didn't come with regrets?
I think that fame's a pre-cursor to death
Death of a friendship, death of a family, death of a man
The misunderstood are always dead before 'they' understand
Staring at ceiling fans, chop up milligrams, draw a pentagram
Lucifer's not a rumor he's in the band, (damn)
Liquor and vomit on my Converse
Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser
Are plastic orange bottles of peer pressure
And I'm ready to cave, I live in a cage
How can I be a hero when I'm the one needing saved
Forty-eight hour days of this fast lane living
Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out then fade away is what Kurt said
I felt the same until I saw his daughter and thought as a father
What if tomorrow, the only I could spoil her was dying?

Turn into a stage and a spotlight?
And everyone around you starts to hate 'cause you got right

MGK,"And that was a dark depressing time for him, you know
He did had one visit with his mother I think
During the time that he lived with me and she brought
Him a huge box filled with gifts you know clothes and all
Kinds of little goodies and stuff and it sat in the corner
Untouched, literally for months he'd never opened anything just
Left the box there

What's going on in your mind when someone
You haven't seen since you were nine is out at your door step right now?
Rewind, remember that one time when Marco showed up at the front door
And we found out he escaped from a psych ward
And stole grandma's car?
Ah, rest her soul
I know that's off topic, but I miss her soul
So ironic that she was blind but told me how handsome I was
Every time that I walked in the door
Can't lie and say it was easy being 14 on February 14th
Watching a body die in my arms
Then have to go to a school that I hated
When my grade indicate that I don't give a fuck what's going on
A couple hours later on
And not to mention that one bitch that I loved
By the way I call her ""bitch"" because she was
Wanted me to catch another man fucking her
Invited me over, told me to come into the front
Come upstairs and say what's up
And there she was
Little slut
I was broken hearted, should've broke that bitch's jaw
Just for playin' me like a chump
But instead went to the garage, grabbed one
Of her brother's rifles, went outside, and shot that other
Mothafucka's truck up
I guess that's what lead me to cuffs
Becomin' common in my life like funerals was
Daddy's less common now, he gave up
After he heard the judge pin a fucking felony on his son
Funny enough
Me and Aunt Barbara even closer
Start to feel some weight lift off her shoulder
Till it piled back on when a radiologist told her
That she had breast cancer and might not live much longer
Fast forward
The woman that I call my ""mother"" isn't my mother
Or even blood but that's how much I love her
And I'm feeling awkward 'cause the doorbell's from the person that I call her
Maybe I ain't ready for it
Shit, what should I wear?
Fuck that, I ain't going down there
I waited over a decade for closure
Why should I receive it if it might not be something I want to hear
In the mirror is a empty reflection
And in my head are questions I want to ask like, ""Where the fuck did you go?""
Why did you turn my birthdays to the worst days every year that you didn't show?
And if you must know, I didn't turn out to be much else
Than a drunk who fell face first to a pile of hell
Took four snuffs of the devil's dust
Ended up with my manager helping me 'cause I couldn't take a piss by myself
But I did get a record deal
And all my records got that making of a legend feel
And I did have a daughter who I promised that the way you made me felt
Is a way she will never, feel
Slip a Benadryl in my cup
Ech, fuck it I'm sickening up
Pit of my stomach clenching, all my muscles stiffening up
I ain't been this nervous since I got jumped
Flick the tip of my J over a surface cover with ashes and junk
Took a pull and set it down
Put on both of my Chucks
Reach for the door but my hand's sweaty, I'm anxious as fuck
Couldn't even hit the stairs without
Remembering how many years I was there waiting to see your car pull up
Now you saying she's right there?
Man you saying she's right there?
You telling me if I open up this door right here
That she'll been standing right there?
And after all these years am I wrong for having this fear
Of meeting the reflection that was missing in the mirror
Open up the door and then I see her",Story of the Stairs,2015

But after the tears our love will smile through
I'm sure that I could never hide
The thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older we'll proudly declare
Wasn't ours a lovely love affair
 
Our love affair was meant to be
It's me for you dear, and you for me
We'll fuss, we'll quarrel and tears start to brew
But after the tears our love will smile through
I'm sure that I could never hide
The thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older we'll proudly declare
Wasn't ours a lovely love affair
",Finale (Pt. 4)/Our Love Affair [From Strike Up the Band],1995
