Killa Sin,"Yo 
Older cats 
Yo 
Whassup Rae? What's going on Son? 
Whattup dude? 
Yeah  I ain't see y'all cats in a long time 
Check it  yo 
Y'all better be on that shit too 
Older cats max with young godz who got the guns 
KnowhatI'msayin son? 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Y'all the little y'all the youth coming up 
Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
KnowhatI'msayin son? 
Yo son 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done 
You the first man, you go first son 

I'm Mobb Deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be 
On some thug shit, runnin' wild through New York City 
Bustin' guns rockin' jew-els that shine like sun 
Stapleton is where I'm from 
And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
Will have my enemies, behind trees 
Niggaz that think they live 'cause they puff a little lye 
Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us 

[Chorus]
Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns 
You right about that kid 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know 
Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
The beat is sounding like Star Trek 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue 
So yo, youknowhatI'msayin son? 

Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon 
I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
I live by name and cut veins 
Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses 

[Chorus]

Older cats max with young godz that got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums 
From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
When I dine, the automatic weapon 
Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
Niggaz talk about they rollin deep up in here 
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair 

[Chorus]

Older
Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down 
Yeah, and yo 
Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin? 
I want to tell y'all 
Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp 
Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin 
YouknowhatI'msayin? 
Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child 
So just take your time and handle life as it comes 
Motherfuckin' Rubbabandz, the young godz comin' through 
Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 

Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace 
Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
We never play with commercialism 
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism 

My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
I'm packin' chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones 
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal 

[Chorus]

Older cats max, the young godz yo they got the guns 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Or get stung by the killa bee stinga from the slum 
Come the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 

Older cats max, young godz got the guns

Yo, older cats mack, the young godz, check it out 
Yo, older cats mack, the young godz, they got the guns

Somebody sent their wolf pack in their clappin' rounds
Actin' like, what a way to play these clowns
Some shady town guerrillas tryin' to lay me down
Yo maybe Brown, done set it up, who give a fuck?
We vested up, from head to gut, them niggas won't get the best of us
They talk to me, silently they stalk with me
Awkwardly, till they seen my two ninas
Fiendin' let us out of these jeans, would lean'em , leave 'em
Coughin' and bleedin' even, barfin' and wheezin'
Son they, called for it, we at odds, and we gon' make it even
Burning Season long 4 keep pourin' on the heat Lord
The more beef they bring Killa, the more steak to feast off
One shot nearly took a cheek off, should've seen him leapin'
Dancin' like Ed Norton catchin' a smack from Jackie Gleason
Bloody Mooners, episode 1 where weapons get spun
And those who gamble with them hammers'll surely death will become (get over here woman!)

Yo, nigga, pass the mothafuckin' Belvedere, nigga
(Ain't no fuckin' Belvedere)
What the fuck is that? Grey Goose, nigga?

Yo, where the fuck is Tony at, man?
He in the room right here?

He gettin' his dick sucked
A bitch suckin' his dick)
Not again, B (Damn, nigga)

Oh shit, son, she slurpin' and burpin'
(Fuck that) Listen, listen, listen, listen
(Oh shit he gettin' his dick sucked)

Five and a half in boys (uh-huh), ass is off the hook (word)
High school pussy, heard you got the best nookie
Sugar walls, rocks o' love, slide right on my dick
I'm palmin' ya ass like this while you ridin' it
I'm about to cum boo-boo, chill for a sec
I feel it at the tip, ma', ya pussy's too wet
One false move and I'mma blast like the very first time
Burnt you with candle wax fast while you was slobbin' mine
Dick is sensitive, you moved, baby here it is
Oh Lord, I told you not to move, you dumb broad
Cummin' for days, wettin' ya cage
My dick is like the sprinklers and maybe a douche, I'm here to save the day

Some eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas

Killa Sin,"[Intro: RZA]
And I told him, ""Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me""
Yo, yo..
{*singing*} Everybody, everybody, everybody,
everybody..
Yo, come on..

[Chorus: RZA {*singing*}]:
Everybody plays a fool, sometimes
There's no exceptions to the rules
Get your nines

But in Brownsville..
Check it out..

Niggas was psyched out, Beretta brought the dirt bike out
Everlast just came home, it was his first night out
He was arguin' with these bitches how they don't mind their business
When he was locked the fuck down, no one came to visit
He was snuffed, black, his little cousin Moe stuck Cap
That's Miss Sommers on the bike with the gat like, ""Fuck that""
But finessin' over here, he could've wished he had ten more years
Cracked a cold beer then bust a shot in the air
Everlast, ego went full blast, didn't splash
He'd act like his head was too big for the casket
I told him, ""Slow down God, you ain't wild
You ain't been in these projects in a while
Runnin' 'round with that old school style""
Don't think these young bucks won't lay you down like tile
A hard head makes a soft ass, these New York lads
Chopped faces, you talk fast - they bust off fast
And chase you out the hood, in a bloody hood
Yo, son, you seen that kid was actin' Hollywood?

[Killa Sin]
Yeah, I mean that nigga, clap happy Cali, clap when he 'ttack
Most get astounded by sorrounded sound effects in the back
Adidas shoe, phat laces, packin' buldge in his jacket
Head nappy, black and nasty, but he nasty for gats
He nas', passed me, bumped me and laughed, then flashed me his Mac
Said, ""I got sixteen for you, we could bang on the track""
So strap this, nah, this bar's a bullet, par pull it
In fact, blast me bastard, I done came to far for this

[Solomon Childs]
Boulevard life, remember late nights?
Mama stomach touchin' a bed, two bids
Cats sacky in Comstack, retire from the crack
I'm askin' Allah that the warm Hennessy help me
I ain't chose the struggle, the struggle chose me
Lord forgive me fore I have stolen from my brothers
Snaked my brothers, even killed my brothers
Familiar fishscale, everybody plays the fool
The +Older Gods+ givin' me jewels
The younger Gods givin' me tools
Solomon Allah, I feel I was jerked
To the drug dealers, my baby mother's a flirt
Holey socks, one fatigue suit, what you feel it don't hurt?
That's my problem now, I ain't afraid to talk
Still cop coke from the well Willy
When I was young I got robbed from the neighborhood bully
'Til he forced me to hit him with the nine milli'
Now him and his click know that I'm a thug fully

[Chorus x2: Solomon Childs]",Fools,2001
Killa Sin,"[Ndira]
Here we are..
Bobby, I was just wondering, you know
About me and you, tonight
If we could go to a little Rhumba
Dance, you just think about it and let me know

Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba
Con bailan, con meguen, es La Rhumba
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba

Rhumba? What's Rhumba?
I'm sayin though, what?

Yo, what up Butter Pec'? Girl, you got me shy to speak
You the same dime piece that I saw last week
On the dancefloor, yo, the way you bligh
Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide
Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink
Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync'
My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much
I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch
That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web
Not these everyday hoes sweatin ghetto celebs
Powerule, I heard you got the good Power-you
Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two

[Chorus x 2]

[Method Man]
Hey, hey, hey..
Uh, uh, uh, uh..
Eh eh eh eh eh..
Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beefin, let him know that you cheatin
Runnin 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop out ya bows

[Killa Sin]
I don't want to dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike
Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice
I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night
Polite, I need a bag of that grass
To blast me out of sight like a satellite
Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you
Look at shorty ass shakin like the system in my vehicle
Clubbin, 20 deep, buggin, all types of funny freaks
Mouths wide shut, we let our love for the money speak

[Chorus]

[Beretta 9]
Yo
Open season, open fire, Beretta barbed wire
First platoon strike soon, scud-missile on the whistle
Up in the club with the pistol
This chick bumped into me like, ""You Dig', you ain't official""
Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo
She was like, ""Yo, nigro, nigro""
Puffin all that trash, you best to see so (so so)
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, ""I like that""
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that
Flow and a half, blow at her back
I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name
I was like, ""Say mine back""
She was like, ""Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy""
I love it like that, Beretta stay givin it
Power-you so good, I just might have to jizz in it

[Inspectah Deck]
I represent myself and my own defense
Innocent by reason of no evidence
Plus they're tryin' pick the punishment the judge insists
My fingerprints were traced back to six gun clips
Cop witness, who try and testify on my click
He on the payroll that's why I got my prior dismissed
This is framework, somehow they got ahold of my flick
The night in question, I was restin' home with my chick
Then the spot was blown, cops rushed in, shots were blown
I jetted out the lab with socks and boxers on
Undercover chased me down for three weeks
He ceased to interrogate like I might speak
But no, I won't tell ya who I work for
And no, I won't tell ya who the work's for
You can hit me with the book, brick, hammer and all
I dig a tunnel or just scale the jailhouse wall
Your honor..

[Chorus: unknown reggae artist]
True me ???
Dem a see me push weight and dem claim dem see me, dem try frame me
But me nah snitch, they try and test me me bust my clip
Me on de blunts all de time and de gyal dem a wine
True dem Rebel I and I, we bust down de sign
Try frame me but nah me nah snitch
They try test me me bust my clip

[Kool G. Rap]
They got me framed, locked and chained
'cause some lame on the block was slain
Cops came but I ain't pop a flame
Hear me ya honor? I ain't dropped a thing
I was cuffed, they told me that somebody dropped my name
And the time they tryin' to match me with is not the same
I was knocked from 8:00 to the time the shot went rang
When I woke up, I smoked up and watched the game
Then I laid up with my bitch and got rocked with brain
Release me from this Elymer Fudd shit, the glove don't fit
Too tall for the cop description and slugs don't fit
He was hit with a nine right? I bust slugs with a fifth
You got any of my D.N.A. or blood up in this bitch?
I'm not the guy aligned to fall, this not my crime at all
You lock me up, I'm climbin' the wall
You want me scapegoat, so stay close, alliance will call
With some grimy niggas schemin' on the shines in the hall
Fuck that, you and the D.A. spit-shine our balls
You can catch up with me some other time, from mines to yours

[Chorus]
[Killa Sin]
Come on a plea bargain for what, your honor?
Nah yo I ain't do shit, the only thing I'm coppin' is a new whip
The night it happened I was lampin' at a deuce flick with two chicks
Kim and Chris, we guzzle Cris' on some Rush Hour 2 shit
I knew the kid, yeah we had problems, yeah I robbed him
Now it's '98 though and the handgun was a revolver
You tryin' to play me on an old case but I hold no weight
Turned myself in, I skated on them keystone jakes
Right description, right Killa, wrong case, I didn't hit him
Here's the verdict, not guilty, not tryin' to see a prison
Got my life on the line, you want to grind me through ya system
And have my family and my wiz cryin', I miss 'em
You buggin', you the same judge that framed K with the drugs
Somebody came up dead and now you want to blame us?
This shit is too much, aiyo before you screw us
I'll grab the bailiff's gun and light this whole room up {*gunshot*}",Framed,2003

Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me 
The K-I-double L-A T-A-why, call me the locster 
Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics 
Respect game, with or without these gold chains 
We're sure the West got shit sold 
From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some 
Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen 
Payin' 'em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja 
No pretendin', we're steady ballin' 

[Chorus]

From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin' chips 
My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit 
'74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip 
Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip 
Makin' moves, pushin' luxuries to ol' schools 
I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne 
And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows 
Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe 

Who keep it knockin' with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin' 
We're rockin', Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest 
Player that you spot, duck or dodge? 
It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty 
Left em deserted, heat em where their pockets hurted 
Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn 
With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz 
Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's 
With them 8-ball gangstas 
And the young mack knees and that's for sheez

Killa Tay,"[Lunasicc]
Now who the fuck can hang with this westside crook? 
Put niggas to sleep, swing with a left counter with a hook 
Jook niggas like Barry, bodies bloody like Mary 
Too scary to even look at when that ass gets buried 

Gettin' carried away put to death by the vet 
I'm a rider, Sac-town, Southside og timer 
Gangsta for real, I peel hoes like peelin' oranges 
A warning 

Don't run up on these crazy Californians 
I'm on ya, like leeches out the mud on yo ass 
Pull out the strap, cock it back, unload on yo ass 
Dodgin' the cops tryin' to get my props, pop 'em like a pimple 

Like 3X Krazy, ain't it all so sick, ain't it all so simple 
Pistola packin' 
See some marks then I'm jackin' 
Run up on him then I smack him 

Put one in his New York jacket 
Ridin' away peepin' the rear view 
Lettin' you bleed in the middle of the street 
Motherfucker we don't fear you

Uhh 
Nathan soft 
I breaks 'em off 
Like Bo and Lurch 

If you scared to do some dirt, go to church 
Fuckin' with these cap peelas 
Niggas that stack scrilla 
With the mack in the back of the van 

For the man that run up on the Killa T-A-why 
Do or die 
Twist Dosia to keep me high 
Sleepy eyes 

Creepin' up with no disguise 
No surprise 
When I draw down, instantly bustin', touchin' brains 
This, ain't no fuckin' game 

Kill 'em up ain't nothin' changed 
Murder one is my specialty 
Death to niggas that step to me 
I take it to the next degree 

Take 'em sicker than leprosy 
Inevitably, I'm steadily dodgin' task 
Heavily pervin'', servin' corners when I'm mobbin' on the gas 
Nigga I'm a cap peela 

You fuckin' with a real nigga 
Drug dealer with a nine milla puttin' jacks down for the scrilla 
Fill a, nigga with lead 
Leavin' him dead 

So rest in peace 
Light him up like a torch 
From the South to the North from the West back to the East

Puttin' in work 
Like a bg can't see me like a right hook 
To the brain too much game for you to match about my scratch bitch 

Nigga don't need no practice 
Show me the loot and I'm at this 
Gat up under the mattress 
One up in the chamber 

Real gang banger 
Ain't no stranger to this danger 
For dangler, fade ya like the major Cali chronic 
Niggas that test the west gonna rest in peace and that's a promise 

Got 'em hooked like phonics 
Shakin' 'em up like I'm Mystic 
Wicked when I'm with this stay in motion like a stick shift 
I rip this 

Burn 'em up like syphillis 
Let 'em know I'm locced, leavin' 'em broke like it was Christmas 
Stompin' in my steel toes, always down to bo-guard 
We hoo-ride on tight tracks got sacks like a nose guard 

That capital I-N-D-O got me faded, affiliated with ballers and thugs 
Movin drugs to make a profit, pockets swollen
Rollin' blunts up fatter than your dick 
Sick approach, puttin' in work with my folks Lunasicc

I got no time for you bustas I'm born and raised to be a hustla 
We creep in the night puttin' it down on you suckas

And when I come I'm a dump 

Jump out the back of the van 
With the mack like man where the funk, punk? 
I keeps it poppin 
Non-stoppin droppin' shit like a seagull 

Blastin', without no mask kill 'em up fast when I mash my Reagle 
Flashin' quicker than faggots at a disco club 
They bow down, when I come around 'cause I'm oh so tough 
Shoelaces tied so ain't no reason for me to trip 

When provoked I choke a bitch until she gimme that grip 
Murder I wrote, like movies make the whole crowd scream 
Runnin' through the back door bustin' like I'm jackin' for cream 
Nigga duck down 

I'm 'bout to pound like some cake 
Psycho, schizo, to the nymphos can my nine get ate? 
Nutty like the professor 
Pullin' out weed like dressers 

Make 'em all fall 
When it call for laws I change like draws 
Into a killa 
Fuck the world I'm out to get my scrilla 

Don't give a fuck about bitches, don't give a fuck about niggas 
My trigga pulls like pimps, with they hoes on the strip 
'Bout this money, ain't nothin' funny when I'm clockin' that grip 
Bag 'em like they some groceries 

You niggas don't know me 
Tight like blue Nikes, I'm kickin' this funky shit like Shinobi

I remember back in the days we used to live so right
Not word about a thang just ridin my bike
Clicked up with the homies at the school house ballin
After dark I hear my teacher at the front door callin
I ain't leavin til I hit this J sittin in my mouth
Walkin home hella high passed out on the couch
Those were the dayz dead now things did change
Takin dibs and yellin out young thugs names
Tappin phones tappin homes best watch yo back
Get gd up in your life stop worshipin scratch
Leave the dope game alone and find your way back home
Give love to the thugs that are passed and gone

Been so long I miss my homies
Been so long I really miss my homies
We keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
Been so long I really miss my homies

[Killa Tay]
There are so many homies to this game
But will it change got me goinin the same livin the range (?) the brain 
Feelin the pain
Wonderin if ill ever see my G's again
Dependin on god to GLD when I need a friend 
Resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
Pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
Prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse
We livin revalation so I'm headed back to church
Ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons
Officially made no more stressin we infested in funds
I'm still thuggin money can't change me
Still free until I'm six feet deep I rest in piece

Been so long I miss my homies
Been so long I really miss my homies
We keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
Been so long I really miss my homies

[Marvaless]
Rememberin some times
About the old school days
When we was rippin verses 
Strictly for the love of the game
Talent shows were the thang
And all the sessions were packed
You had to raise out the stop if you were weak on the rap
Put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
Servin them all with the dream 
No matter how bad it seemed
Kept our eyes on the prize
Always strivin for more
Raise up in the ghetto
Fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
Half way we be choosin
Missin all my homies restin six feet 
Always keep your name in the streets
Make sure they know how we did it
Until we meet on the other side 
Ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
Til we meet again stya up and tru

You scared of the heat muthafucka? 
Stay away from the barrel
And I ain't never been a rat
Or been scared to ride
A lot of niggaz act tough
But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor
But you really scared to die
We could spit a verse about you
We put yo life on the line
Military mind ain't never put his nose on the line
A real souljah never retreats
When it's time for a crime

[Young Noble]
Hey yo....
You can talk that shit
But how many of why'all can do what we did?
Muthafuckas talkin' bout the Lawz ain't shit
Bitch ass nigga should get off the Lawz dick
Muthafuckas mad that we got our own label
Outlaw Recordz, we ain't fuckin with you haters
Niggaz know the Lawz been holdin' this down
If you don't see him now
We don't fuck with that clown
Loyalty... (uhuh)

Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they want to take us under, under, under

[Kastro]
What's Loyalty?
When a nigga say he love you
But all awhile he don't think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh.... 
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You ain't real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
you ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

[Ed Bone]
My life's a blessin'
My life's a lesson
And if it's ride or die
There ain't no question
ain't no time for second guessin'
We ain't bustas
Niggaz ain't new to this shit
We some muthafuckin' ridahs
And why'all niggaz is the opposite
I sense bitch like a dog sense fear
So why'all better act right
Anytime that I'm near
Live in yo ear
Everyone's a ridah in here
Cross game
Watch them ridahs appear
Muthafucka

Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine and great Henry the Eighth
Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don

I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence, and documents
On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented

Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues

And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying

Had me cooped up lookin at loot, butt, and thighs

But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme

I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learned Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edom
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness

Restaurant's on a stake-out so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga Castro this co-pilot
Who used to drop like stacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't

Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slinging in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Getting paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Could've wrote a book with a title ""Age 12 and Going Through Hell""
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Sticking up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!

It's so hard to escape the gunfire

But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so

So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, detect and reflect this
Light I shine, because my powers is refined
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes

And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

I strolled through the books of job to unfold
And open Bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take

I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom

Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome

I prophesied to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin' evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

The basic instructions before leaving earth

Killah Priest,"Guns, shootouts and crack sales
Black males who pack jails, trapped in hell
No peace, cold streets, surrounded by po-lice
This whole week, buildings with no heats
No lights, the gas pipes the snow leaks
Dog fights and lowlife throw dice the whole night
Thieves, creepin
In the midnight evenings, saw through the misty regions
Go to your house, take a vial for the demons
Moon in, the lunar eclipse
Prophets stand in the midst of the seven candlesticks
I can't take it, beauty that was once sacred
Is now gettin facelifts, fake tits, and fake lips
Cold embraces
Memory erases, from the slaveships
My princess, I used to spot her from a distance
Holdin my infant, burnin incense
The moment intent, for her to step into my wife tents
Now we step in pre-sents, for your ebony prince
The small of frankencense once treated like a pharoah
With royal apparel, annointed with myrrh and aloe
We used to wallow, amongst the mallows
We had herd sheep and cattle, now we battle
Used to pass over Brooks of Qe'ron
Towers of Lebanon, the pool of Gechron
We used to sing songs, upon Mount Hebron
How is gold turned to bronze, and shh
How is gold turned to bronze
We was the wisest and the richest, now we turn to snitches
Women turn to bitches, in the time of harvest
We was the smarteest, worshipped Wisdom like the Goddess
Now we act retarded, we forsook the Wisdom of the Fathers
We use to have a thousand flagons of wine
In Palestine there would drink Ballentine
And raise up in the violent mind
We used to have a hundred measures of oil, eighty measures
Of wheat and barley, we live Godly
Listening to Bob Marley, before the devils robbed me
Chasin us through the African safaris

Singin holy anthems, lampin with all
My handsome grandsons, hair long as Sampson
Inside my gold mansion, they used to wear purple Pampers
But now we Black Panthers, some are actors and dancers
It's funny how the dollar bill have my seeds holler for meals
Mother swallow a pill, roads seem hollow but still
Grab a bottle to heal, it's like a noose
Of seventh seal over Brownsville
What's the difference between the ghetto and death row?
I'm trapped up with cleptos, the tec blow
I'm left in seft low, where the cries echo
And echo and echo and echo and echoes
From the Crystal City, near Getti
Children used to grow on lillies, now they roll up Phillies
But the pyramids of Cheops, is my weed spot
Sometimes I eavesdrop in the books of Enoch
We went from studying epistles of Paul
Beneath a waterfall, rubbin crystal balls
But now we spray paint initials on the wall
On the wall spray paint initials on the wall

sent through the god's commandment  feel me.. 
I move through the dark rages  and won't stop until your ?  
until your bleedin'  until you stop breathin'  
giving careers a severe beatin'  for emceeing  
it's something that I don't take lightly  how the fuck you ever fight

to a duel, I drool, before I break through, then I drag emcees, 
beat um' down to their knees, grab their necks and squeeze!, 
till there's no life left, they lifeless, they micless, 
what a crisis, I give them a good nights rest, 
I break they biceps, and triceps, thighs and necks, 
breast area, is the best area, before I bury ya, 
I make sure that you never, ever, ever, ever, try that shit no more, 
know what I'm sayin', (word is bond), no ambition, 
put you in that fucked up condition, leave you with your own

shit was non-fiction, now you in a state of non-fiction, 
make you beg for mercy, if you ever approach me, I blow your head off, 
when I talk, chop off your arms, and bash your head in, 
you know where this shit is headin', for a dead-end, 
stop your sweatin', like Otis Reading, got your pants wettin', 
snuck up on ya a wedding, at your honeymoon, turn that shit into doom,

half man and half goat, tomorrow hopes, based on the horoscopes, 
we followed goats, our nose and hella smoke, 
fire breathin' dragons, I rubbed the gold lantern, 
to the see the future, through the crystal ball, 
the triple walls of fisher wants to miss the fall, 
offence, see the coffin, often, fell at the doorstop, 
coughin, I heard the pipe organ (cough), saw some men of a white 
origin, 
I saw Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush, 
bare foot, sucking from the titties of a wolf, 
upon the braisen altar, 6 men offer they only daughter, 
splashing holy water, I ran for the, camcorder, 
now I play with curses, I roam the Earth's surface, 
snatching purses, allergic to catholic churches, 
what's the purpose, religious worship, is worthless, 
I visit ancient sanctuaries, where the saints were married, 
but now they buried 'cause of Satan's fury, I faced the jury, 
held in court, like Christ nailed to a cross, confront my knowledge, 
like Christ in front of Pontius Pilot, days are violent, 
standing in a haunted palace, the government wants my wallet..

",If You Don't Know,1998
Killah Priest,"(Are you trying to tell me that you will fight against me?) 
Oh you will win that too
For if you fail to silence me  you know what I will do

(What will you do physician?) 
I will go among the people  
And try to answer the questions that burn in their hearts 
The questions that I've asked myself  for all my life 
Wherever I've wandered in the world  and which were answered for me 
By a dying man  I will wear the clothes of a slave 

And kick the sandles from my feet, and speak to the wives 
As they fry their fish before their mud huts by the river 
To the porters on the docks, to the smiths by their belows 
To the slaves under the yolks, and I will say",Intro,1998
Killah Priest,"Run for your lives, oh my God
Yo watch it! Yo what everybody runnin' for?
This is it, run for your lives
Motherfucker quit pushin'!
Oh my God, run for your lives
Yo what's goin' on?
It's coming! It's coming!
Why is y'all runnin'?
It's over, it's coming
Where y'all going? What y'all running for?
It's over, it's moving closer, the sky getting lower
Hey yo, yo!
Winds turn colder, Killah Priest soldiers
Wait for me yo!
Steamrollers
Whats up motherfucker quit pushin' me up!
Right there, there, it's over, damn he's right there

Hey yo who the fuck is that?
It's over, run! It's over, run!

All science addicts religious fanatics
Curiosity seekers biblical preachers historians
Ritual believers scholars teachers spiritual leaders
High priests generals sergeants and them rude captains
Lieutenants lower your gimmicks I'm the hip-hopper
That'll rock to fill a opera acapella locked cellar
Watch hell-ah, freeze over take you lower break you bold
Constrict to hit you like fingertips in your soul
Put whiskey in your soda or vodka
Chop you with a blade made of copper
Kick your head off like a soccer, brawl
Raw alcohol and it's over, arrest over in October
Punch a hole through your solar plex, and it's over!
I mark X on your chest it's over, and bury the dead
Ain't gonna be no rest

Just pretend, watch me blow like the dust in a gust of wind
Flow with the rush when I adjust the pen take you
Miles and miles and miles leave you at the river of the Nile
Now deliver the vials, fat, found in the pile in the stack
Books that were took, take a look, back
As I take you further high into the sky
Where your eyes like vision surprise then dive back
Vision buildin' the bombs, upon you peons
Knowledge you crazy Knowledge we be goin' off!
Now you lost tossed in confusion, saw an illusion
Of the car that started cruisin'
Actual day mathematics were raised to his attic
What's the weight of a flame, state your name
But he was afraid of the height, glazed at the light
Strayed, couldn't stay for the flight
Ran to his book of rhymes, took up some time
For the brother to hook up a line
As if he had a fishing rod, but my mission is God
Science I be dishin' out be hard
Deep in his eyes, contacts, plus saw beyond that
Saw the brother couldn't respond back
Tried to rhyme after me to hold the weight
But the science done drive dem niggas shoulder blades down
Let's take a trip travel through the mind
And played a trick when he unraveled the rhyme
Bloodthirsty no mercy when I bomb no thinkin' emotions
Sick him with potions that I've developed
To make the body swell up like venom
Once I'm in em then I skin em and skull em
After that I call em, back from the essence
Who the fuck want more lessons? It's over!

Know what I'm sayin'? It's over
The dead bury the dead, it's over
Your career, it's over
All you wack M-C's (finish em up) it's over
Finish em up

The blast, burns back into elements
Development of gas around the mass of the Earth
A hundred and ninty six million
Now a hundred and forty thousand miles are occupied
By people causin' housin'
Over this the mind was just browsin'
Thought I was warm coats, I dispose hope
Of the focus and roast energy toward the enemy
Now in burnin' G's, chemically enforce infinity
Attack, third eye, what occured my, vocal form into a storm
Went blaow burnin' but left him in the crowd wonderin'
Now you wonder on many thoughts you ponder fell asleep
Tryin' to seek the beyonder while I would ponder microphones
Recitin' poems, strikin' domes to your frightening moans, of horror!
Speakin' evil Hebrew from the Torah
Slammed the mic it turned to a serpent, open the curtains
Saw things he couldn't interpret, destroyed the Earth
Fill it with gunpowder, came build sun power
Rebuild it in one hour
Then revealed it through a sunflower shared the shower
Showin' the power of the North Messiah eyes on fire
Water oxygen you can't comprehend to these strange doc-trines
Stop the winds, beyond the orbits of Dionne Warwick
With no broomsticks and magic tricks is this
Return of the Iron Maiden
Stomp your corny ass like the Raven
What's the matter? You frostbitten, you lost your mittens
It seem you wanted to cross to smitten
Secret more from the Christians

Huh, it's over!
Your careers is now, finished",It's Over,1998
Killah Priest,"Your arms too short to box with god... 

KP  Killah Priest  Iron Sheek  
These times we gotta take one step.. forward. 
Put one foot in front of the other  my brother.. 
Yo  check this out  

Early natives related to throwns of David  
Captured by some patriots  and thrown on slave ships  
They stripped us naked  while they wives picked they favourite  
Lives were wasted, in the hands of the hated, 
Driven from the garden [garden], now we starvin' in the martyring Sodom, 

They call it Harlem, wordly problems got us at the bottom, 
The Earth crisis, and the righteous grab their ice picks, 
Seekers like us for our rices, I stay in ciphers, 
Our live is, connected to second son of Isaacs, which had a tight grip, 

On the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother, 
The elders who served the younger, words heard in thunder, 
Down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger, now it's cold in summer, 
To slow your slumbers, behold a number, 600, 6 and 3 score, 

The same as he saw, who ate his heat raw, in the time before, 
They climbed aboard a dinosaur, information held behind the doors, 
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here, 
Then they gave us crack and beer, in the back of the stairs, 

Please adapt your ears, add or subtract the years, and form the unwise, 
And watch the sunrise from sunset, none-slep, one flesh, one breath.. 

[Chorus] 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath

One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath 

Devils morale, they caught us playing with the gold marbels, 
We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle, before the devil sold me, 
To the unholy, because my father told me, 
I lived like a monks of lowly, lowly, but lowly?, 

The president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti, 
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Ufraeties, 
Maybe they send germs that polluted our sperm, 
And made us live with circumcize in the serpent eyes, 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies, 
But in the halls of Farrow the walls are narrow, 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom, 
Now free them, lets feed um', feed um'... 

They took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica, 
Promised us 40 achers and a mule, treated like an animal, 
Understand the jewel, brought to the 50 states, 
Deuteronomy 28, verse 68, it all relates, 1555 is when we first arrived, 
We tell jokes wish um' get high, and watch the fish fry...

The door is open, yeah, yeah

It's like, beware of bio chips, I share hits
Harder than slave whips like I waited to get tips
From Egypts to sea ships, to bein' chased by new york
Cops out the precincts, and words was bricks
We buildin' projects to pyramids, evil kid
I destroy your ass like London bridge, smoke trees of weed
Take off the leaves out the twigs, pure truth is what I got to give
A lot to live for, you ain't rich before poor
It ain't peace without poor, how would stand without a floor
Under, over, toxicated, sober
Younger, older you're elevated, higher than a empire state
Elevators I roll with creators and creamators
Stalkin' through this nature, the heaven raise ya
Capacity in your brains beyond the clouds of rain
Seven and a half are contained
Space was my birthplace, meditate in cocoons
Now see snakes in human costumes

Expand your mind
Expand your mind 
Expand your mind 
Expand your mind 
In time, in time

Call this, the blind man talk, cripple man walk
See nor hear not summon as lord
Divident per segment def unseen beings
Speak no evil to all I see, tappin into the
Worlds vision with the proper rhythmic meditation
Situation on lives from state to state
Rent to pay, state debate, contract dates
Cheddar in error, slave mental death to the treasure
Washing my robe in the blood of the lamb, constant plan
Never strayin' new york cause I rock supreme forever for I can never
? blackring on the ? axe spring the ghetto compact
Put em on tracks, and let's see how they act as the aftermath
Increase accelerate the sun behind you radiate, to burn to ashes
Ain't one of the parties you been crashing
Bring the beat and I'm a slash it
My niggas make sure the doors have been barricaded
It's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ? block spin?
But make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts
Redrum mania reincarnate to another shape
Bomb flashes, what can happen, new jack-in
Your rappin' ain't the magnum so when he cought up to half these
Niggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion

Expand your mind
Seek and you shall find

Walkin through the penile glands, like it was a unfathered man
Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway
Through a long dark hallway
Use your conscious as a compass to avoid bein' conquered
By nonsense, use your subconscious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
And leave bread tracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
You might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understandin' is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatric's could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
Cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
Which is always competitive, therefore
You must never let it live

Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind, seek and you shall find
Expand your mind, seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find

Like a space probe  let your tape roll to roll 
My ways of life shine purple rays of light 

Ways that are right take long days and night 
Then I enter wind  there's no interfere 
No sense of care  tense at the prayer 
Then we exalt like ci-ties of Leba-nese

As fine as jewelry, I chose the finest your highness 
I chose the finest your highness 
You see my instructions, are not silver 
In knowledge forever then choice gold 
For wisdom is better than rubies 
And all the things that may be desired 
Are not to be compared to it 
Our wisdom, will dwell with punics 
You're my one and only, during our holy matrimony 

Attract my homies, subtract the phonies 
What it manifold, make a man explode 
Love episode, give me rest when I'm old 
So clear and unbefouled, plus runnin wild 
Caught you as a child, brought you under clouds 
Never earthquakes when I'm home from work late 
Never forget your birthdate, I love you

Black fatigues with our hair raggety!
We all Supastars even without +CREAM+ and cars

[Chorus]

Know why? Street tycoon up before high noon
Followed by the spot, zoom lens, ghetto peepers singin my tune
They say I'ma die soon, livin without time, sketchin my outline
(It's a hitman!) Too late to make a speedy recovery

Lovely, with shots that done smmothered me and covered me
Choppers above of me, what a startling discovery
Our own brother be the one with the killer instinct
Just because I'm a so-called star

[Chorus]

Well, I just wanna be myself, I don't need nobody else
Working for long life, and good health
No what's about the wealth, see that's the way I felt
I'm okay, confide in God, will help

Tried to put me on the shelf 'cause I'm so excellent
Damn you nowhere with no persistence
You don't want no selfish thing, don't have no confidence
Well, you don't have to be a star to be yourself

Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone

Now we soon to be, one in unity

If you're blind of the wicked ways (yeah check it out) 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (yo) 

The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti 
Slaughter babies from the waters of Euphrates 
Maybe they sent germ that's polluted our sperm 
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies 
But in the halls of Pharaoh the walls are narrow 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom 
This be the dance of the graveyard 

So do the spank with the dead zombie 
Here comes the tanks of a Red Army 
The real Jew is you, Jeremiah fourteen and two 
Enforced by the Hebrew 

Ya hovered by the eagle, America is evil 
Let no man deceive you, beat you, or mistreat you

And Edem means redneck

Nah, I'm goin out like Joshua 
With a pen, an army, and an apocalypse

The six doctors, that wanted to take my brain into a laboratory 
Destroy me, since birth

is evidence, and the future, there will never be none 
If we don't be-come, unity

Give em BACK with tons of speeding bullets

Tellin lies to my vision, I was given, enough time 
To master, the criminology 
And Mr. Pastor, teachin demonology 
Words of dope knowledge, I demolish

When my thoughts are spaced out, come down to EARTH

And a victim of the unholy ghost

Verse Three: 7th Ambassador 
He listens to the cries in the distance 
of the next victim, wishin, that he had some assistance 
And right before his eyes it appeared 
Beware when the shadow caster, demon master's in the near 
He blocked the true light from your sight 
And transformed your brightest days, into your darkest nights 
I had your blind man praisin the grave 
Cause he feel the cross, that lays in the dirt 
And think he's in the church, not even aware 
That death is near, and he's one step from his grave 
A naive mental slave if he had, his third eye sparked 
He mighta been scopin 
Them demons that be lurkin in the dark 
Always keep your glowin eye open 
By knowin who your enemies be 
I can see you but you can't see me 
Escape from your chains like, Great Houdini 
And disappear, like a majestic genie, in midair 
Vanish, that's my advantage 
And then I transform to a hurricane storm 
And rain holy water, for seven days 
And seven nights, the chosen ones spark the light 
Of the Sun, that's killin off villains by the ton 
Sealin all the doors to the Hells, correct spells 
That were cast on my peeps that were weak 
Made to keep, my peeps in a deep sleep 

Verse Four: 60 Sec. Assassin 
Behold! The angels out the heaven 
Who professes a whole new rap, session reposessin the gossip 
back so black, better hand over your act, or trapped, to 
Seven fifty three, who have received the law 
By the dispositions of angels, and have not, kept it 
Transgressed it, better burn your testaments 
Ain't nothing changed niggaz is gettin arrested 
Beat down like wrestling 
On the count, of false impression, indiscretion 
Advise em all with the glimpse, of a third eye 
The silent sleep, and wicked 
I work you niggaz out like physics, I blast out from the heart 
of Brooklyn, like an arrow, just stick to my point 
It's narrow, I shoot niggaz back, into the time 
like Pharaoh, I smoke up on your brain, leave it 
burnt as Sahara, that leaves desert, with a rock storm 
Leavin niggaz buried and puttin them at Lou's lawn

Or didn't you understand 
I'm drillin niggaz back under the surface of the land

Show the righteous man, stand in great lonliness 
Before the face, of such that have afflicted him

Bobby said, ""Fuck spendin 50 on a whip, buy a clip""
Mental flip, got a thousand tracks thought on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
You split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer, with extra compression
When sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalizes the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryin to think you can match this
The portrait's too graphic
Panaramic view for you, stamp Wu 
The feature gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We wrote block-tic checkpoints on your next joint
And who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed, for killin cascades
Throwin bullets in the air to test wind
And which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise, still civilized
Kill spies on the wall, that still flies all dies

Give no extension on the lynchin
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt, that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin, breakin his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds
The enemy walks above, Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shatterin bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments
Of cell, inhale these venomous thoughs that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin the power from electrical fences

Sleepin on silk pillows, blood on they robes

Like magic wands, castin spells, sendin niggaz to Hell
Trappin they souls in realms, baptize em with holy water
Springin on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters
Silent nights over the dividers, a 1000 muslim bibles
For the cobler, hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation

Fallen angels from space intruders

See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liqour

Threatenin the lives of those who threaten me
Lessenin my chances of defeat by predeterminin the victory

I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was livin all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharoahs change to cattle

Singin at his eyes on the sparrow, mind narrow
2 positions, horoscopes and tarots
Hark harolds, angels and Christmas carols
Raven images hang from the mantels

Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who man-handled us with leather whips and burnin candles
And rambled through our castle, leavin niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow

Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
Then flight with insight
Everything i thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil to sun blacken
Then came rao czars, left tracks and scarred
A pair of brightness of exploding stars
Gave me goods to taste
No ingredients to traced
And remained stuffed trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, released 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate my razor scrape, phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pierclastic flow sets of a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspace of thrust
Even wearing camoflauge the analog at war

The father came in accompianed by deadly rain and when
Mentally indowed when lighting hit the crowd
The warm side crushed the barrier
The storm side destroyed your area

Where unskilled skaters, couldn't figure-8 twice
At 16, uncut, direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt
In a vote, it spoke aboat the average loss commission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
It kept the jury quiet, and now a riot will form
While satanic man, now hang in his dorm
I swing, on you fake, radio personalities
Boost ya ratings, but hypes behind casualties
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play
Instantly, slap ya fire like it's Palm Sunday

The earth use, and built it to a complex

Increase the force significantly, change the error

Guns we played with, niggas I relate with

Sent out secretly to take my head
I lay back and meditate to the words they say
Skip town for a mutten goofy dred
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin me
Sign all documents, usin forgery, 'cause just a near thought of me
Like Solomon, spoke bluntly
Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants, and old kings
Who sold everything, on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied Pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth 
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell

Killah Priest,"[Intro: Killah Priest]
Time... come...
Wake up... what?... wake up..
I can't get up yet
What we have here is the experiment
(My eyes, I can't see)
It's called the 6 million dollar man
(I can't see) He has the speed of a cheetah
The site (I can't see) of a falcon (my arms)
Strength (what's happenin to me) of a hundred guerillas
(What's gonna happen?) Welcome to the new world
We gonna give you a name (What is you talkin about?)
What should we call him? Let's come together in one mind
What should we call him? We should call him The Electric Man
Right, we gon give you a time, to break out
Time of life, and then the hunt goes on
Ready? Let's start the clock
Electric... Get outta here, I'mma break out, I'mma break out

[Killah Priest]
Outta one came many, Electric Man runnin through the Electric City
Ruled and govern by electricity, it's like a dream
Our superiors are pathetic and they show synthetic pity
Road blocks are set up by robots, cops to check your code wit a red dot
You can hear man plead for his self esteem
For the love of God, we all sufferin
We fall asleep, they handcuff us in our dreams
We wake up and scream, the world explodes if it's overload, we hug our pillows
Heads inbreeded wit barcodes, it begins to burn, slow like charcoal
Millions of civilians ride by the carloads
They head to the ships of the cargos, they head back to the Congo's
After the bomb goes, ban 'fro's, Beetle brand clothes
You wake up in your dreams yellin, silent screams
Every time you breath is recorded by scientist teams
DNA, mind is demonic survey's when you speak, they confuse you wit wordplay
Claimin Christ never rose on the third day
That was a Good Friday, and the day he fell was on a Thursday
The undisciplined, the ignorant, the insufficient
And the unworthy, screamin for God's mercy
R.L.S. get bloodthirsty, many were persecuted
Executed, that have no soluted
Family trees were uprooted, anyone found on the streets were obsolete
Military killed the unnecessary, cops would cheat
Death, grenades, blades, anti matter rays
Through age, hurricane tidal waves of slaves
Follow the maze through the grave
Those who disobey, now obey
Somethin satanic invades the planet
Panic, the Sun of Man versus the Uncle Sam
Line intruder meets the computer, alert ya sharp shooters
Send the weapons that where nuclear up to Jupiter
New stars, Lucifer, global drag that space this
And the racist of the great wisdom of Malcolm X
I'm stressed on house arrest
New World Order, the slaughter as Solomon and Godorrah
Beast rises from the bottom of the water
Havin seven heads wit plagues
The feds versus the dreads, the reunion of the Soviet Union is ruined
Watchin every day like the movie True Men
Thugs push off their last minute drugs
Marines jump in their submarines and get their machine guns
No more sunlight, the final fight
Bring forth your pitchforks and your pipes
And you shovels, the rebels and the Devils are now leveled
Bacteria becomes superior, man becomes inferior
And the day of the prophets, so did the little child
Lookin through the windows of Spartan
The sky fill wit total darkness, the world of total stillness
Energy arisin from a local village, no more privilege
Men hearts'll feel this, vocals are silent quiet, do you feel it?
Peace and quiet, no more riots, soft like whispers
We see men wit gold slippers, read the scrolls of scriptures
Garments were angelic, gold robes that were sowed wit velvet
Silver helmets, children were silk, drinkin soy milk
Laughin and lookin at the world that they built
Calm lake, smooth evergreens, new redeem
Food for the kings and the queens
They all seen shakin the tambourine, shakin all the cymbal
They dwell in the Temple of the Mental
No more poverty stricken, robbery, guns be clickin
Forever burnin in this furnaces of affliction
Over dose and drug addiction
Thugs who just buy the system, will shut the blood of the victim
Sacrilegious, savages trapped in prisons
Trynna adapt the wisdom, they sit back and listen
To the old timers, the beast out the clotheslines
Bullets claim the lives of minors, shoot-outs in front of local spots
Even TV's takin photo shots, we in the third world
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
Terrestrial escape through the east gate
Electric types of prones, protons, neutrons
Electric soul, electric glow, electric probes
Electric lights light up the night
Neon, skies, neon site
Note the flight, first man, mind and sometimes
Resemble Einstein's now turn into Frankenstein's

Tear your face off the planet, leavin' one-third damaged
With you back cracked the earth canvas, leavin' mountains slanted

Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws

Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with you hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us

Then sent her {ass} back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms

Killah Priest,"Destination: ?
Trapped in the dandie's lion with a pit of lions
World crying, inside, what the fuck's goin on with me?
What's goin on? What's goin on?
Ugh! What's goin on? What's goin on?
Yo, yo

Deep in the Water of life, I would fight
Wearing turbens, purified up in the virgin
Emerging the blood, would flood up the wombs
The eggs hatch, and let loose, a fume
Prophecized just like Jesus, writing Hebrew
On the wall's of my mother's fetus
Then I was swimming in the afterbirth
Each chapter, each verse, got deeper, got worse
The keeper, of laws, my brain, what saw
The seeker, of tablets, preachers, would ban it
The force, brought forth, the holiest, controlliest
Slowly, takin me, into, the mental, orgasm
Was 'jaculating, stimulating, relating to life
Incubating, rotating around light beams
Like creams, I was formed in the white dream
Redeemed, like powder, outta, my maker
Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh.. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

I was born alone, begun from blood, skin and bones
To the mind, body, soul hunter, creating poems
For immature brain cells, trapped in confusion, I ruin your mental
I sent that ass to Hell and tell the devil that I sent you
I react like a reflex, protected by God
Bringin life to the brain-dead, diggin deeper than the graveyard
The stick that you walk with, I broke a long time ago
There's nowhere to hide when I stalk like a shadow
Everyday somebody dies, somebody else is born
A chain reaction, life's a cycle like plastic
I practice, ghetto bastards I'm givin caskets
Innocent, murderous is what you don't expect
While secret Satan agents be livin off your death
I'm already a waitin victim to an unknown death trap
Hell is gettin hot, is it too late for me to sweat that?
The killah team, guillotine get chopped where your heads at
In order to get revenge ya got to pass my dead end
I use your best friend to set ya up for me to win
To put the blood inside my pen to write my next sin
Then again, the beast from within, it just possessed
It leads me to kill, then I'm left with your bloody mess
I seem insane, since semen my brain been gained
Like Monopoly, but there's no way of stoppin me

I die slow, struggled in the wounds of evil
My technicality wins a race based on reality
Everyday is still a revolutionary thrill
The war's in the streets, bodies floatin down the bloody river
Terror, livin in this present day and era
Caged in the belly of the beast, thoughts of a killah
The duty of a wise man, prophecized, civilize the savage
Yeast, I generate heat from the East
Repells revelation, livin in revelation
The Sunz of Jacob shall fill the power of the nation
Created, situated, on physical plains, originated
From drops of sperm, the black germ
I come with the scientifical techniques and masses
The methods of madness, psycho wrath of gases
Burnin through flesh, deteariatin brain cells
Waves radiate as I escape the channel of Hell
The arsenal, one Prodigal, Sun of Man
Stalks the fuckin land with evil, various plots and plans
The wicked lashes shall buries us inside time and matter
I write chapters through the raptures of disaster

Trapped in a long dark tube, fightin for exsistence
Absorbin stressful germs as I travel the distance
Eternally locked in a cell in the form of sperm
Doing life, mental strife, evil semenal germ
Swimmin through revengeful cycles, accumlatin arches
Killin of the sperm cells, illuminatin darkness
Stranglin 'em with my tail, absorbin life from semen
When I was born I came out screamin and blasphemin 
Cryin in blood, spittin at the figure of Christ on the holy ?
See, since the sonogram I was diagnosed to be cursed
Doctors administered stress, I'd be born in the church
But they sold the womb closed of unholy bitches
A burst up, reversed and blast through the stitches
Ahh! Hell at last, my first breath that I cursed
They performed the ritual, took me home in a hurse
But in the womb I metamorphesized, my birth and death was already prophecized
Instead of a crib I slept in a casket
Sacrificed the first born but Christ denied this evil bastard

You're trapped in my helium of evil thought, figure your way out
Or be comdemned to eternal livin death",Deep in the Water,1999
Killah Priest,"Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin

Formed the Disciples and the Sunz of Man

I was chained, and thrown in the tombs
With 85 people in a long dark room
Christ appeared with a robe and a beard
We had a deep conversation, and then he disappeared

The prophecies of a poor man end on a train
Take his last breath
Slumps over drops his last bit of change
A mother pacing by her window pane

Staring hopeless at the gentle rain
When the messenger returns telling her
That her child was slain
She reaches for his picture frame

Open up the good book read the scriptures
And sighs his name
The skies full of flames
Streets are gothic

Twelve niggaz lay dead in front of their projects
Reminding D`s of a classic mob hit
Bitches gossip, about they men being targets, or suspects
Niggaz in the lab taking golden seal

For tomorrows drug test
Scared niggaz hugging they techs
Don`t want to get plugged next
Outside there`s a bloodfeast

We all product, faced with hard luck
Since the wrath of God struck
Now we like ""Yo Tone let me borrow a buck""
He like ""Yo what the fuck""

Niggaz was born to be skeletons
Or was it the curse of this dark melanin
When I die will I open my eyes in Hell again
With these jealous men

Lord forgive me but I smell a gin
On the lips of winos
Sent a plaque turned `em all into Albinos
With horns coming from their foreheads like Rhinos

Read it in my last testament and my hidden scrolls
See my icon straight faced with a torn robe
A beard and some cornrows
The whole globe hears when I perform my shows


[Chorus: x2]
We go from hard times to part-times
From part-time back to hard times
That`s the start of crime
'Til the day we see the father shine
Light on us, trying to warn us
We play the corners

[Killah Priest]
I visit monasteries
Where dons were buried
Approached the bench with teary eyes
Tryin' to con the jury

Christ said those of you without sin, cast the first stone
Those of you without ends, blast the first chrome
Is it the prophecies of Deuteronomy
That drove us to this poverty?

Trapped with starvin' seeds
Fightin' for sovereignty
Cold nights make the toddler freeze
Blood over my wallabies

Raining mahogany
Here`s a dollar for the trees
We worship weed like idolatry
Silly bitches with conniving thoughts

Sticking knives and folks
Don`t understand what it`s like to be a black man in court
Niggaz up screamin' all night
Complaining that their handcuffs are too tight

Kicking on the cell till they cut out the lights
It`s like a curse
Walk besides white women they start holding they purse
I just ask you for the time bitch

What you got anyway? Some of the Indians turf
The Beauty that once flowed from the Nile
Like the Moses child
The hand that writes is a good as the hand that holds the plow

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Some say the spirit of a dead angel lies within me
Look in my eyes, they`re empty
Poverty stricken beaten with the rod ol' envy
Lurking through the shadows of death

Dragging my wings, saw the image of a beast
Ram, dragon and queen, heard the bragging of kings
Whose laughter was as bitter as a scorpion sting?
Forced in the ring with idiots so many cliques

Letting out automatic clips
A dead lady combing the hair of a bastard bitch
I spit graphic shit you ain`t hear half of it
From my fucked up marriages

To dealing with miscarriages
From drinking with savages
Driving hazardous
I`m here today to meet the man from Nazareth
Where`s the pastor? Show me where that chapter is

Killah Priest,"When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

I heard a wise man once say, ""Thugs pray""
But still slugs spray from the double barrels
Fallin’ pharoahs over the graves of the sleepin’ prophets
Release the pain from the deepest closet

It's like a secret that we keep in bondage
Mothers weapin’ from they projects
First it be that soul, send to haunt the empty halls
Memories painted on the wall

Like The Lamb's Blood on the doors, of the black Hebrews
Nowadays the same people on subway trains sellin’ street news
A ghetto movie, with no sequels
But I still show you previews

That will free you, from your evil
An old man, cookin’ her-on, over hot tea spoons
Old G's are all evil, usin’ dope needles
Wearin’ fan parafanil's

We live in the black hole, where no one can hear us
The valley of the dry bones, without reflections in the mirrors
The world fearers, first make 'em feel us
Come on

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

The Solomon couldn't say it better
It's all vanity, and sanity
We come from broken families
My own pop's abandoned me, black becomely

The spirits of Lords upon me, I grew up hungry
Now we chase money and live grungy
The fears want me, to bring me to the hills of this country
So they can jump me, feel me up, in land and dump me

Damn right I said it bluntly
I ain't scared of none of y'all monkeys
At school my teachers used to flunk me
Hopin’ one day I turn to junkey

But only God can judge me, words of Makaveli
Black Israeli, hear me? Told you y'all niggas gonna feel me
Killah Priest AK Masada, sincerely yours

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

So check out my darkest secrets, my truest confessions
Come to you as a blessing, parental viewing in this aggression
Is advised, tune in to the wise, zoom in your eyes
Step up closer, to the light, like that child on Poltergeist

Wisdom be ultra right
Explosive to the sight, 3D, virtual reality
Verbal mentality, come with me
Load up your gun with me, run with me
Become one with me, this is channel three

High definition, ghetto TV, DVD
Cable networks, stick your fingers
In the bullet holes in my sweatshirt
Take it out and taste the blood, so you can see that its real
A View From Masada, give kids, chill

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

Killah Priest,"[Killah Priest]
It's time..

I'm tied up in the basement, blindfolded by nine soldiers
With rare paintings and fine sculptures, they spoke blatant
Their nine's loaded, they put a gat to the back of the blind poet
I want to cry but I try and hold it, one of them notice
Crack me over the skull with a crime motive
They made a toast to my death, I rose to my feet
With the heat close to my flesh
May I say these last words to my enemies passing the Earth?
Laughing at my passion and merge, ""Ok, kill me if ya'll wanna""
Slay me and never play the corner, cold winters
You're all gonners, tell your momma call the coroners
You get me, and God gets you, it makes sense don't it?
In the heat of the moment

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest]
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, ya'll know the deal

[Killah Priest]
After the sunshine there's rain, after the laughter there's pain
After my chapter there's flames, after the rapture the master shall reign
Shockwaves blacken the terrain, and man looks strange
Open the book, see I'm king, read my name, and see thy wings
Believe I changed, I went with the horse, slept at the pastor's door
Heard the whispers through my enemy's walls
Rode the elevator to the thirteenth floor
Console with Gandi, since God placed his hands upon me
I rose up commanding the army, demanding my laundry
Talk to monks, holding a pump, ya'll niggaz wanna roll, what ya'll want?
Shout at satan, shout at the pagans, cats wavin', one of the brave men
Priest

Chorus x2

[Killah Priest]
I know somewhere my assassins await, setting traps at my place
Phones tapped, all my actions are traced
I lay back strapped at the waist
Who's this bitch with a match in my face
I don't know, ""Don't smoke 'em, thank you""
Slipped somethin' in my drink with an ice cube
Nice move, bright jewels, she's with this white dude
She said ""I like you, I'm in the right mood,""
And she comes with a price too, but as the night grew
She saw the black heart, the Archangel Michael
My gats spark vital, her arms show track marks
Close the rival

",Heat of the Moment,2001
Killah Priest,"[Intro: Killah Priest]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to +Priesthood+
If you purchased this album from a store
Or you got a copy from a friend
You about to witness one of hip hop's greatest secrets
That the record industry tried to hide
Due to lack of promotion and scandalous intentions
Priest was forced to take his album underground
And now he will no longer suffer
Reviewing this album, you gotta ask yourself why
Look at every song, and I'mma let you decide
He is one of the greatest MC's, ever to roam this planet

[Killah Priest]
Father forgive me, it's the Henny or Remi
Or maybe it's the many of fame, this world planted in me
When I was just a child, I was misunderstood
Til I saw your finger in the cloud, I was picked from the hood
I was in the myst of a crowd, when shit wasn't good
Til I heard your voice out loud, then I lifted it good
Doctors wouldn't tell me, the teachers would often fail me
And for a grown child, that shit, just wasn't healthy
When the bitches hadn't dealt me, never planned to help me
But now I'm a man, I understand what's really wealthy
It's not about how much tuition you got in your bank
But it's bout how much ammunition that I got in my tank
Yeah, yeah, now y'all scarred 'cause I'm talkin revolution
What ya rather see me dead by a fuckin execution
If y'all probably go to bed, 'cause it's less confusion
All your see in yo head, is my electricution
But I'm comin back, and this time I'm strapped
And fuck +The Law+, 'cause I'm bustin my gat
And I'm wanted by y'all, and my niggas know that
'cause once they fire, my niggas shoot back
And straight up on some real shit, I'm a lyrical jewel
Ask a wall in the air, and pay ya spiritual dues
Fuck the B.A.'s, 'cause nigga suck a dick
And all ya rabbling backstab, I'm not fuckin wit
Aiyo fuck poppi' collars, I'd rather cock the revolver
And have ya momma cryin, while ya sister's watchin them dollars
I'm one of the best, next to 'Face and Jay, Nas, 'Pac and Poppa
You can say Priest or Masada, fasada, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
+Blackball Me+, ya just +Blackball Me+
+Blackball Me+, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+

[Killah Priest]
So, fuck those critics, I ain't got no religious
What ya thought, ya act suspicious, but ya get it
So chill wit it, plus nothin of y'all, ever been in my shoes
Ya probably, play wit a doll, when I payin my dues
That's the type of shit that darkens my heart
Where was y'all motherfuckers when Marcus got shot?
Where was y'all when the guns sparked up my block?
Where was y'all when my sister, was coppin those rocks?
Where was y'all when Pooh fell in my arms?
I had to drag him out the buildin, when them niggas was gone
Where was y'all when that nigga, put a gun to my chest?
Pulled the trigger, but no fuckin bullets was left
What ya figure, that my life was filled wit happiness
Ya wrong, I tell you for real and not the fake stories
Ya can get mad and +Blackball Me+, motherfucker

[Outro: Killah Priest]
+Blackball Me+ (5X)
+Blackball Me+ niggas, +Blackball Me+
Ya know ya bad motherfuckers, +Blackball Me+, +Blackball Me+
+Blackball Me+, +Blackball Me+
I still come back, motherfucker
It's time, motherfucker
Now you left me to judge, fuckin critics
Monkey judge, fuckin wit a muthafuckin prison
'cause at the end I'mma see you redemption
Believe that, why tell the truth to Allah...
+Blackball Me+ motherfuckers...

[Movie Sample]
Many people feel haunted
By what they call evidence of evil forces in the world
They see genocide, senseless violence, plagues
And they blame demons, or the Devil himself
They believe that demonic spirits can actually possess a human body
And that only rituals of exorcism
Can lift the possessed from the darkest regions of the unexplained



",Intro (Blackball Me),2001
Killah Priest,"Up and down
Didn't I say niggas gotta come ready for more?
Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Ain't nuttin here, ain't nuttin you gotta say to that
Now what you gonna do about it? What you gonna do
about it man?
Bring it any day!

This is madness, niggas runnin up the block, duckin shots
Cop cars swervin, niggas squirtin, the ghetto's burnin
Hell's season, the soul's returnin
We live like crows and a hermit, searchin for a higher learnin
The fire's burnin, lightnin bolts comin down
Hittin both coasts, leavin niggas comatosed
That's why I wear the chrome close
And we'll all meet the omen in the moment of most
Runnin in churches with my gun, I'm nervous
Disrupt the service, ask the pastor, ""Where do I worship?""
My life is worthless, I done seen so many nights and murders
The enemy stuck a knife in Curtis
I wake up in cold sweat, grab my Tec, I'm hopeless
All my homies pullin on roaches of foul coaches
Or loud explosives, return to the hood like the child Moses
A bastard in a basket, my gat spit
Till the palbearers close the casket
And that's it, the end of the chapter
The beginnin of the next one
The resurrection, imperfection, after death come
The black son in the ghetto section
The light protect them from the iron weapon
This is madness

This is madness, this is madness

Mystic night beneath the cherry moon, we rarely move
Peace to the ghetto nation, three million population
Guns poppin Satan, feel our feather wings
Eloheim as we bury kings
Our fathers pumpin' garbage in their blood streams
The novel of Apollo, every thug thing
Blood, money and cancer inside a dope fiend
My hungry team sellin' drugs, Verazine got me feelin' buzzed
Ghetto breed felonies, my niggas face the judge
The witness tryin to place his mug, the D.A. tryin' to taste his blood
And the lawyers is the court employers, showin' fake love
The court system is 33 and 1 third of a mace and club
While niggas is still beefin' and tradin' the slugs
Who's to blame? I hear cats callin my name
Sayin, ""Please, don't fall in this game!""
We're all in a gang
It's like the ghetto, got me trapped with a ball and a chain
To them crack rocks I swallow, absorbed in my vein
Nightmares of bein shot, record in my brain
My neck and soul dropped and fall in the flames
Every night I wanna roll a Dutch, scared to sober up
I'm like a bird in the cobra's clutch
I'm like a bird in the cobra's clutch
This is enough

This is madness, this is madness

You bought this Proverb baby!

Every day I hear violent screams outside my window
I see black hearses followed by limos
On your forehead I see the devil's symbol
3 6's, do the arrhythmic of the witches
And Grand Wizard, can you withstand the blizzard?
I see prophecies unfold that was told by the prophets of old
Looked up, I saw the clouds in Heaven roll
Back like a gigantic scroll
UFO's came down to damage the globe
3 rolls, saw the lamb with blood on his robe
While the beast shove us in stoves
And the government swallow our souls
I'm gettin' drunk of a wild Irish rose
My brain's haunted, roll with much pain and torment
A fire like Elijah that came with the warning
Bodies being carried at the sound of the organ
Saw the skeleton, the rider of the Four Horsemen
Pull out my dick, chop off my foreskin
Take the blood and write down my four sins
On the side of Satan's coffin, I see angel's corpses
I start to gettin' nautious from demonic forces

This is madness, this is madness

What up little nigga, what you smokin on?
Only 14, product of a broken home
Out late, tryin to tell me that you're makin your livin
Tryin to see how much weed you can take in your system
Indeed, take out the seeds, then he finished his sentence
Askin me what I believe, have I ever repented?
Type of shit niggas talk about when they get high
Passed out, hazy eye, lettin days go by
Bullshittin one another with the same old lies
Tryin hard not to show all that pain inside
Saw the clouds turnin black like an angel died
Preacher said you a curse if you don't pay your ties
It's like that to the day that our loved ones die

Damo and El Rukas, in Hell feudin, the 60's movement
The death of Newton, the resurrection of Clarence X students
The revolution, this is rebel music
The other day a young lady threw her baby of the roof an'
Six niggas died from homicide and drug shootins
My homey's mom just went of the loose end 
From drugs abusin, this is thug amusement 
Bloods and Crips, huggin the strips 
Lovin they clips, sittin on dubs in they whips
Folks, GD's and vice lords, when night falls
Black pimps and white whores, from the immortal words of Jeff Thor
To death do us all, the sets I recall, til we rest in the morgue
From the pilgrimage of Larry Huger, to the tribes of Judah
We live our lives through ya, in My Hood

And inside niggas waitin on their road call

Yo, we got uncles comin home from doin a bid
Movin ya crib, with you and ya rib, is how a few of us live
The rest is always in dept, feel the heartaches of stress
Can't argue 'cause God makes the test 
I hear oldies from OG's who grow old tea
Some OD in doorways, out in cold for four days
It's like that all day
We gat rollin 60's, for over 50's
Triple-oh's in the windy cities
Latin Kings, Manhattan Queens 
Spanish cobras, band of shoulders, families of soldiers
40 busters, 4 corner hustlers 
From west side, to Bed-Stuy 
Neathas in fiestas in neckties, Wepa
Essays, and Chevy's with hydraulics

So many types of women, a life that I was livin'
The clubs, the thugs, the nights that I would give in
It didn't feel right in my system but I was with 'em
Trying to fight the feeling but I was just like a victim
Caught up in the rhythm of dough I was spendin'
Drinking down venom, the bacardi and lemon
The bartender grinnin', the party's just beginning
And I was sent into it, it was probably endin'
I mean the stars, the cars, the cards that you charge
To the brauds that you meet at the bar, it's all a mirage
I even ignored my true calling from God
Hid like Jonah in the club with bottles of corona
Surrounded by models and owners, and cronic smokers
The ones that you find in a coma, play the corners
Gun holder sprayed the foreigners
But today I'm no longer, much stronger
Witness my song, 'cause

My nigga Boog died in jail, the rest of my niggaz crying bail
Laying in an iron cell, I tried going to church
But it seems like the Pastor keep molding a verse
Until my mom go in her purse
The Lord knowing I search, I needed therapy
My heart's beating heavily, I'm seeking heavenly
For the rest of me, my man says stay weeded, that's the recipe
Until the cops arrested me
My destiny is to leave a legacy, I don't have much
But if the Lord credit me, you'd see the best of me
I found a new life the day within the Bible page
While the popcorn's in the microwave, I hop on a tidal wave
I'm being stress free, I can do it if you let me
If I'm wrong then correct, or it just could be
Or it just could be

Trying to unite the bloods and crips""

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist

'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center

You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus

I seek revenge upon the earth like Christ

Where niggas get cornered with a cracked jaw
I divide niggas like religion
End at abandonin' shit, tellin' mad lies to your vision
Burnin' me is invain and imaginary
You must be insane and fuckin' with mad theories
All niggas gash you, thoughts could match this
Got burnt, and return to mothafuckin' ashes
Your show is weak and your dead body corpses
My rap slew the youth like death and divorces
Now take em through the chamber, watch 'em feel the danger
Of a guillotine, this is how I kill a team
Don't scream bitch, have you ever seen an iller dream?
A nightmare, causin' you a slight fear
Come the omens 'til you fallin' through your right ear
Your eyes bubble, but there lies trouble ahead

Let's do it...

[Killah Priest]
Slug out, never that, young dude, clever cat
Eat shit, smoke spliffs, get high, reminisce
Innocence, bulletproof, any one, pullin' through
Junior High, do it fly, fuck in grade Summer school
Comin' through, get me drunk, blunted too, every month
Hundred shoes, every son, wanted jewels, never front
Got older, hunger grew, watched most the younger fools
Squat out from the guns they usin', not close to the most of them
Quarter rolls, microphones, one, two, revolution
Sons due, evolution, in a rhyme, ghetto music
In the mind, 'cause I'm movin, in time, intwine
Lines all out of ideas, thoughts expose the road
Painted pictures, mask very clear, like a spear
Fallin' from the atmos, my raps soaked in the pages
Kids I play with, different flavors, instant paper
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
I just breathe, the breathe of life in the mics
Feel my notepads with sites, now, guide you like God did to Israelites
I just breathe, the breathe'll in whole tap
Into my cassettes, fate awakin' you, holdin' in like herb in your chest

[Killah Priest]
I'd rather spit it to it right, then a dome
Like a jewel in a throne, microphone, recite a poem
Hypotone, mellow out the ghetto route, track thugs meadow out
Crack blood devil house, gat slugs, here's your addict
Pushers of conceited habits, took us, look and seen me mad it
Cash laws, blast hog, gas talk in the hood
Black boars, burnin' wood, crack walls turnin' good
Nickel bags, crystal mag, blackout, semi' four
Black watch, ready for war, sasquatch, fantastic four
Blood, strength, through the Clan, wear the colors of our black
Love our mothers, love our dads, sister drug out on that glass
You ain't mad when they ain't sell refer, jump out the window, chasin' Jesus
Hunt me in the garbage, told me, he's a prophet
Used to recite scriptures, and dust, now our skin poppin'
Gems drop in '88, baby cake, first born
I'm crazy late, words long, worst one was '91

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
Second son, I'm stressin' young, blesses come, record deal
Kept it real, tess my skills, '96, my third born
Word born, vicious like he held him tight, and mellow hobby
I'm the father and the author, change my name to Masada
First rhyme, search mine, first crime, I stole a ring
Sold it, soak in dreams, felt guilty but the feelin' passed
Learned to put, all my feelings in my past
Kids that had a thinking, took my books and bring
Gave you read, all these laws
Blow coasts, smoke spliff, old flicks, focused
Flip cake, chicks scrape, that's me, thick braids
Swift blade, in the pockets, sick days in the projects
Slick way, I'm the stocking cap, I just got in rap
Family, photo albums, gun, drugs, know the outcome
Book, sweater, picture very, wedding flicks, obituraries
Lyrics that be military, haunt you like a cemetery
Hahahah... breathe in

Now I gotta scream on everybody (family) everybody battlin'
Battlin' in the street, whatever, check this out, yo

It's Priest standin' in his greatness, God's favorite
I rock the Star like King David, my Queens bath it
I walk past, they start wavin'
Each arm, a thousand bracelets, face it, I'm the greatest

Made women drunk from the royal fragrance
I rock the latest in fashion, my jewelry flashin'
In other countries, they can hear my magnums
When they blastin', I heard they sound like thunder clappin'

Hit you in your stomach, watch you start gaggin'
Who gives a fuck if you're platinum?
If you're lyin' in a wooden casket
For good, now that's Hood...

It's on...

[Killah Priest]
Thou shall fear me, only as thou'se been guilty
Feel me, sincerely yours, Priest, now industry tried to kill me
Before sat at tables, like the Savior at The Last Supper
Amongst nine rap lovers, three crack hustlers, with gats covered

Peep my last words, in the Proverbs, observe me
If you're worthy, I 'member your ass show
When y'all was wet and cold, I cover y'all with robes
Gave y'all flows, when y'all give y'all soul

I gave y'all flesh, covered y'all bones
Breathed in you, sat y'all in thrones
Now y'all betrayed me, I raised thee from babies
To y'all were grown men

For your birthday, I gave y'all your own pen
To write with, beware of vipers, and snakes and biters
I taught y'all about the depths of words and dark sentences
Now y'all don't remember shit, but try to mimic it

When I see my crown, just give me it, it's mine
Seek your own rhyme, it's on, seek your own rhymes, come on!

I lay rappers down, with the mac or the pound
Pop 'em, stretch 'em out with they backs to the ground
Leave 'em lost in the woods, gotta find them with hounds
My four five'll turn a nigga from fatigues to bow-ties, no lie

Put a nigga close by, the Most High
Or he's a Dream Catcher, the Indian myth, pick one
Semi or fifth, your shell get hit, ladies spell my shit
A-D-D, I-see-T, I-V-E, lick your lips, come try me

Contestants, hook 'em up to I.V.

Or watchin' the news, Arabs against Jews
They bombin' the schools, political fools

Instead of peace talk, fuck this world
I ride for Z. York, pass the heat off
I blast at Farahkhan to overthrow Babylon

Oh shit, amazin' grace, how sweet the sound
Savin' slaves, another body found
Bound to the streets where we drown if we sleep
We make heat instead of peace
Struggle to heat, and breathe
On Shiek metal swords before we eat
To teach, shake my head in disbelief
41 shots, a young brotha deceased
Gunned down by police, is there no justice, no peace?
So fuck the police, listen, I walk with P.
Ignorance leakes like back streets of sickness
Or disease, and our weakness, we bleed
Deceive to believe in this modern Eden, we thieve
Conceive through this belly, we beasts
Ninety thieves stalk woods for Priest
Leave out this laws of Camenites
We strive to rise like height
But through hate we over-weigh our fate
And fall like meteorite, to spread the self-sacrifice
Instill like these parasites, in drug bites
Prescribe a mind of 360 degree fahrenheit
In the dark like midnight, these words I recite
I once was blind but now I..

[Killah Priest]
See the light..
Freedom fights in prison, sprung from religion
Taught by elders, the system failed us, no one to help us
Priest is, withstanding Priestess, but stand on thrones judgin' Egypt
Peep the eclipse, the shadows cover the moon
The Devils govern the fools, they stubborn as Jews
Pearls before swine, I quiz them, they need more time
Seek the wisdom, free your mind
From the cobras, it's Priest and SoulStice
We came to teach the culture
We can stand the heat like vultures
Open ya wings, the soul of a King
Song of a Queen, dawned with the wings
Bow and kiss 'em, if he's a fraud than strip 'I'm
From all this badness, greet him with daggers
We more than rappers, we the masters

[SoulStice]
Even after.. World War 3, the war of intelligence
The court, self-defence is common sense
Third corridors and drug stores
Immensely spokes and leave scars of no evidence
Dense minds outlined in chalk, the refined walk
Can rise again like cocks, a resurrection at box
Religious, intervenous, take my name in vain
Clinically insane, hold secrets
Mentally slain for their repentance by the government
Hold the third commandment, who's the man sent?
Modern Lazurus, hands wake the nation

[Killah Priest]
It's revelations, I'm takin' medication, my head is achin'
I've been by a weapon since the 11th
Stars and stripes vs. a star and crescent
God's blessin', be a soldier, I gotta speak out on Oprah
I'm Under Siege, I grab my gun and fatigues
Plead my woman and seeds, hundreds shall bleed
I speak blunted from weed
Do why'all really want peace or why'all want to see war?
Crates of candles on crates of C4
Why they rich and why we poor?
If he Jacob do that make him Esaw?
Is Colin Powell really Bush as Igor?
Why did terrorist attack the entire Eastern seaboard?
Who taught the men to kill theyselves?
They're received Allah's rewards, we need to read more
Priest, I rap with razor blades on the side of each jaw
In the millennium, war against Palestinians
A century is done, plenty of guns
Plenty of bombs, many shall come
And my name, a homeless man ridin' a train
Day and night, leavin' my head with migraines
It's the atomic age, we either smokin' chronic or sage
The blood of Jesus, Decepti-concept
Martin Luther King had a dream
Gun shots create a smokescreen
We throw on concrete, I wear a bandana like the Panthers
Back to court with my handgun

[Chorus x2: Both]
It's real as the masonic seal on a dollar bill
Conspiracy theories that got Kennedy killed
Or the secret governments, Blood and Crip
Worldwide, look at the future through your third eye

Our gats poked, it won't take that long
Anybody grab me, I whispered softly
Do what you got to do, to get them off me
Hands twitchin', gettin' feelings
Saw the security, might have to kill 'em
Walk through the door, damn it's crowded
Walked on the floor, then shouted
(It's a robbery!) Everybody down
Don't make a move, don't wanna hear a sound
Looked a Sharod, gave me the nod
Let me know, I did my job

Told the teller, feel the bags
Had the mack, pointin' at the glass
Hurry up, you're movin' slow
Time is money and I got to go
Grab the bags, head for the door
Backin' out, clutchin' the dog
We heard sirens, dashed to the ride
And cop we see, open fire
Cop car, swung around the block
My man Rock, opened up the shots
My homey Lace, real nutty case
Said let's get it on, fuck a chase
Women screamin', grabbin' they kids
My homey Lace, flashin' the shit
Laughin' and shit, homey is sick
Look at Sharod, said let's go

Killah Priest,"Take my hands out my pockets you can see my thumbs
Both of them turned green from counting the ones
Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue
And kid yo, I never rocked with laws they keep away, we cool
I devised my own stimulus plan, I'm niggarish
I'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice
To free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque
Let the imam pray over my head and wash
Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly
Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley
If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army
Talking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali
Try to stay humble and swallow my pride
In God I trust, now talk about the ones on your five
Crisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin
Village style, feeding the children
Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela
Africans chanting me on like Coachella
Ghostface Bumaye, Kumbaya my Lord
My death day, 24 karat tomb I lay
Wishing they could bury me next to the prophets
Nabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim

The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents, distance, places be forming wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the seven crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
Adorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub
As He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood
Seven hundred books were opened
Embraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean
Skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed
God felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea
Satan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty
K.P., K.P

He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as the fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug will sell your garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
But the users just kept coming back with their life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, the household dramatic
Living rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts
Support from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So he sent them gifts, body parts per diem
In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em",Purified Thoughts,2010
Killah Priest,"Music is life I ain't in to fashion or ice
I ain't into chain snatchin' ain't into smackin' a wife
Fan supportin' don't never askin' the price
If you new you can't afford it you better askin' advice
Stick to the point if I ever had me a night
Y'all gas better hope I don't ever have me a light
Meth, not the type for doin' the pipe
But the type when you feel it you know I'm doing it right
You know I spit it but hate to love to admit it
They criticizing the lyrics 'cause everybody's a critic, look
I push the limit while rappers is pushing gimmicks
I use it to push my pen in then add it in to the premise hook
Y'all, still talk about it and I still live it
Underground without a shovel and still dig it
It's always been about the struggle y'all just didn't get it

[Chorus]
Yo wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up 
The wisdom we apply Son soak this shit up 
If it was sess Son niggaz would smoke this shit up 
So wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up 

Yo yo yo we are street soldiers of the dark side of the planet 
I kill killing orders like a lieutenant 
Hit the planet Earth then explode like a human cannon 
The universal author, born to kill saga 
Givin' niggaz head trauma 
Bulletproof shield is made of gold armor 
Brain surgeon is aversions my purgin' mind urban 
Scientists found killed and wrapped up in curtains 
Casualties, flashbacks, now simply that 
I attack like a rat, serious as a heart attack 
Professional assassinator professor 
Assassinate your mind state and broke the metal plate 
Lyrical Nostradamus, psychotic mind of Sadaam 
Ex-con, attack the Pentagon 
with unorthodox firearm from Vietnam 
I crucify 'em, like Muslims murdering Jews from Jerusalem 
Now who's the supreme lyricist? You can't seize this 
When I die, my name'll be worshipped like Jesus 
War visual individual incriminate the criminal 
My culture nickel put holes in your face like dimples 

[Chorus]

Brains get unfrozen when they oppose, as we unfold 
Futuristic scrolls that was prophesied scriptures 
Fitting an untold, I roll with my skull and bones 
Made of solid gold, skin is closing up 
Approach your home, with a war, Armageddon in my home 
Wisdom mind ruler mental intruder 
From the tribe of Judah 
Devils disappear like they went through the 
Bermuda, triangle, erupting on Ryzarector tracks 
like volcanoes, so God swear to me 
I appear two years sample revolution in the burning cup 
Constitution, learned too much, came off must return 
Observe the facts, delivered by, blacks 
Soon as we unite the sky cracked 
A group of UFO's formed a seven in the heavens 
God celebrate devils death day signal 
Jail let loose the criminals, bystanders died 
Waiting for miracles we giving you 

[Chorus: partial] 

Yo, I make your heart thump like tree stumps 
Be crackin' concrete chumps released once 
The Earth shifts, vocal points clips he wrote and missed 
Killer vocalist, load his fist blessed with loaded gifts 
Golden clips, shotty slipped like psychotic hits 
In soldier flicks, who wrote the shit superior 
Mines combine the modus click 
Enterprise like German spies, keep my eyes on Soviets 
Stay Russian my direction I'm wettin' like a leaf bone 
Freak poems, seek thrones, to call home where freaks bone 
To each his own, chrome zones, be cloned like chromosomes 
So the chrome, the golden toned champ whip rollin' bones 
Fire's on, blazin' hot trails at night, barren ville 
Shotty still collaborating on tracks with Bobby Steels 
Generate a mil, Killa Bee law, kill or be killed 
Know the ledge, finally, our justice has revealed 

[Chorus]

The forty third conviction, incarcerated in hell for eternity 
But my mentality and chemistry made me celestial through the galaxy 
Sparks friction, generating through evaporation 
Slay through meditation, your body is now liquidation 
Even your hemoglobin is swollen with corrosion 
Amputated and rated physical zone disintegrated 
That's what niggaz face when fuckin' with the Sunz of Man 
Go to the dungeon I could lead a hundred men, with a golden pen 
Forced to intercept with the click from Shaolin 
Killin' devils, scatter they ashes over the sea of Mediterranean 
That's my trademark, PS burned in my victims heart 
I be the Star from afar illuminating through the dark 
Another burning face of death 
The initiation of the Mason, 186 my name's left in the Book of Revelation 
Reminiscing about the days, raising hell 
Representative of a mind, able to lead a city what technicality of mankind 
Mistake trying to keep me behind the closed doors of reality 
All three eyes to the revolution can now escape the blind state of confusion 
Trials and tribulations of the original nation 
Leaves a headache, the only chance of elevation 
Unite with the black coalition 
Sunz of Man, population click, Wu-Tang Clan 
First the Killarmy, eat your skeletons, buried in the Promised Land 

You better wake the fuck up! 
That's word life! 
Don't sleep! 
We don't be having that shit no more!

[9th Prince]
Yo, yo yo yo
Check the Killarmy
We go to war like tomahawks and Indians
From the wilderness of our villages
Desert commander live on the gorgeous fortress like the sorceress
To build up my heritage
Shaolin surrounded by the cruel sea, crabs get stabbed
Chemistry lab is filled with motorous vocab
That drive niggas crazy like Arabs in Manhatten cabs
Lyrics heat up the airplay, give off shockwaves
That damage the earways for centuries and decades
I be a renegade through rainy days
I collect guns to blast off like shooting stars
Shot up the charts the soldiers from the dark
Stabbin and gatherin dead in the fuckin heart
A rhymin alcoholic, I'm bad for your liver
Unidentified corpse's thrown in the Ohio River
I'm psychotic in the tropic
Bullets spark through bulletproof shields of narcotics
Killarmy be runnin train on Bobby Steels' tracks
Lyrical poems cock back with sharp tacks laced with ajax

Chorus

[Shogun Assasson]
Here's the pure and uncut war poems from ancient zones
The black Hitler, killer riddler breakin bones
Explosive, overdose the track coast to coast
My shockwaves to keep the thoughts bright like sunrays
My forte is of a higher rank like sensei
Militant, armed to killin and shake the settlement
Searchin crevaces for a wise man's testament
Roll hotly bludgeonin all those competitin
Against I but stimulate ya of life and matter
Cloak and dagger, first I gag ya then stab ya
The apprehender, plus I move like a ninja
No retreat and no surrender
My war agenda

[Cloud 9]
Live via satellite, soldiers with mics
Ancient warriors fight, barbarians swingin swords
Killarmy militant warlords
Military war slang who's to blame
Government officials, evil minds that govern this land gotta plan
For the blacks and the tans
Decrease the population of the rhythm nation
By one fourth, wicked niggas is the source
To the force I bring forth causes havocs, sparks bloody riots
Seven days and seven nights of blue street fights
Like boo took all the shells from automatics
Strategic tactics
Caught between rhymes, lines combine to blow up like landmines

[Beretta 9]
I strike on universal fish, I'm out the clear mist
Relentless, beat a nigga senseless
Niggas best to witness
At how I gets to business, soldier from the trenches
My offense be my defense with military sequence
Quick to apprehend ya, kid you best remember
Camouflage avenger, Killarmy nigga
Surrender your garments and your legal tender
Fatigued ninja with silent triggers

Chorus (2x)

[Killa Sin]
Yo, I crack chest cavities
Be shatterin knees while bladders bleed
Gat'll squeeze, it's a merciless form of my formalities
I locked down south with hip hop doses of death
Within my breath that I drop to make your heart stop
You can't cope with this vocal dope that'll corrode your throat
Yet alone make a local choke
I strip niggas of they manhood because I'm no damn good
And roll with a Killa Wu Clan in the hoods
Attack vitals, suicidals, leavin idols
Is a record through the land of the lost with the 4th Disciple
Stifle enemies, come test
Twenty one in your chest
Killa blessed em with a bloody vest

Terrorist  The Bastard Swordsman 
Holocaust  yo  yo 

Rap diligently  return of the arm 
The star trilogy  scars and injuries inflicted on my enemies 
Attack you mentally  draw up and stand just like a centipede 
Then strike fast  leave ya weak ass up in a sling 
In the infirmary  telling war stories like you was king up 
In my rainforest, yet the God rain the hardest 
Flame and fury, torch off ya skin tissue and cartilage 
Throw darts the sharpest, aimed at ya head, ya man parted 
Looking retarded, telling him you never should've started 
What you couldn't end, handled my friend since age ten 
But he's not my brother, though he helped me out up in da deep cover

Swingin back, double edged axe we cuttin' all of 'em) 

Inflicted with a rare disease, MC's flee 
Fought wars for centuries my wounds bled killer bees 
Roam the battle site word, shatter mics I've had a tragic life 
Blood splatter nice ghetto life live on a satellite 
Blind, injected with venom from water moccasins 
The child who floated in the air lock without oxygen 
For seventeen years all I learned was profanity 
Graduated from the academy of insanity 
Holocaust, loud mouth who roams wise 
I'm hideous glancing gouge out ya own eyes 
West Coast that grotesque group flow's wet 
Bury you and some in Norweiga wit a broke neck 
Wu-Tang, seven death blows 
Explore the globe, 
Stand in shallow water and slaughter those who oppose 
The passionate destroyer who stings like antiseptic 
Barbaric, esoteric, half-sorcerer, half-skeptic 
Anorexic, war machine, 
Depressed, drunken mess 
Learn from the best, snatchin' ya fossil from ya flesh 
Bloodshot, Doctor Killgrave, subterranean 
Skeleton's reinforced with stone and titanium 
Gyros, hun blood and oil flow as one 
Mental powers override iron fist and blade tongue 
The Bronx Don, with bomb songs, hit Hong Kong 
Holocaust is scientific experiment gone wrong 

Yo, Ally Commanders come dress to kill 
At the Armageddon Wedding 
We're the old temple platoon ya die soon 
Our battlegrounds in the womb of the moon 
Most of y'all niggas is cloons 
Gettin' hit by typhoons, machine guillotines 
Rip out the spleens, tonight while ya screams 
I'll blast ya in ya dreams, listen to my bombs 
Like you used to read the Psalms 
I got firearm like Megatron, asthma attack rap 
Snaps, windpipes crack, 
Bury ya ass beneath the graveyard shack 
Third eyes like binoculars, visions of the lyrical opera 
Sponsor the conquer, I blow spots like the Unabomber 
The stage is made of steel cage, battlegrounds of 
Starrcade '98, I meditate at a rate that'll cause an earthquake 
I drop antrax bombs on your plantation, 
Then murder you twice, to make sure there's no reincarnation 

[Chorus: x2] 

My mind is bad, because it's great to see that full 
My old dad, and charter his story 
And made him believe in a my-story 
That's how you know times is bad 
When Gods is being killed by crabs 
That invest these streets, it ain't safe no more 
So before you leave your front door the war is cold 
So grab your heats, your God-you now 
And your Teflon cause the war's on like 
Red Dawn, I'm a threat to America like Saddam 
I be the verbal terrorist doing the strength of his language 
Now I'm mad like Max, when I attack tracks 
To the death of Wu wax, I drop facts like 
Bombs on Saigon, it be the music that makes me sick 
And act like a paranoid schizophrenic, 
I leave your mind in a state of panic, 
Like a claustrophobic trapped on the Titanic

Check it out, yo

This is war niggaz, a duel to the death
You better make sure your swords sharp
And you got a lyin' heart
'Cause, I strike for the throat
And stab them with a deadly note
That pierces the eardrums
Those are the equally grim
Now you're stunned
Another victim of the Shogun
A spinal chop to the cerebellum
So, go ahead, try to run in advance
'Cause I stand firm on my warrior stance
Ready to be-head you, dead you
Rid your body of a soul, make it an empty vessel
Because, your rhymes ain't punctual
My actual or factual, that's why I verbally attack you

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo check this
Thousand dollar line for line paragraph causin' ruckus
Towards y'all, weak motherfuckin' analog niggaz
Tryin' to come into the mist of my digital shit
You get flipped on, snapped on your collar bone
And a spike, cause I don't like snake niggaz in my eyesight
'Cause, I'm so agile and so quick to pull
My razor blade sharp sword out the case
And chop your face, disgrace y'all to another place with
No traces left behind, where the body was laid out
For the coroners to figure out 
That it was one swing from the guillotine
That decapitated his head from his shoulders

Or pisteens slugs that penetrated your entire

With the science to control ninety-nine, keep all minds aligned
All the selfish will be dealt with by the nine
M-M which stands for marksman, regard the last swordsman
Which chop off your head if you don't live accordin'
I sincerely love Allah's mathematics, camouflage fabrics
I got a revolver, fuck automatics, the black Asiatic
Lick 'em off to a shot at your motherfuckin' attic

Yo, I'm a legendary swordsman, bionic man like state forces
Seven horsemen, wu-ninjas move across coarse sands
I murder niggaz wit my bare hands
It's darkness in the wu-caves
We hang crusades, salute grenades, the sixty ways like frave
My pistol has an infer-red, as an eagle
Loitor will lag, blast the brains out of apple heads
I leave MC's and DJ's on twists at deathbeds
Underworld statis, the black knight like Latice
Destroy the midnight train, my domain is built like alactics
Beretta 9 the killin' machine
Shogun Assason is that nigga who chases you in your dreams
Killa Sin will kill again with the same knife
The thief of Bagdad could steal your life
PR Terrorist and Prince Sadaam moves the middle-east region
It's razor blade season, so all you putty-faced niggaz is badly bleedin'

Yo, I'm like a landmine, schemin' on air-time
Keepin' on the standby, flight and blow the crowd with their hands high
For now I amplify sounds of the coliseum down
First round, face down, lace clowns like a nightgown
Light brown, deck them down
Eyes wide as I recite, beamin' the mic
With satellites, tri-state cream
To travel right, fleein' the scene
Team fights with the livest MC's
So, Killarm, strike your moment of silence
Live degrees, well you're eatin' them off
That's the reason why your legion fell off
You popped corns want to be war pawns
Once, the war's on, and Al Pacino won the last of red dawn

Yeah, Killa-Arm
This one here's for the people (word up)
To families livin in the ghetto
Babies, right there witchu

Make ya feel it, on the outside
And make ya feel it, on the inside
And make ya feel it..

[PR Terrorist]
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
Have you ever asked a grown man why?
Why do ya feel that way inside?
Sometimes I had to swallow my pride and settle for less
Lord don't settle for less, you more like the best
To me, as I pull my head out my skully,
and I give praise due to those who mean somethin to me
Moms, you incredible, you raised me all by yourself
Regardless of the situation, there was food in the shelf
Pops, you abandoned me, you left me all alone
In this cold warzone, I had to fence for my own
My sister Candie, probably the only one that understands me
Girl I love you to death, you never turned your back on me
La-Familia sick, I wish I had the hands to heal you quick
And rid you of a disease you livin with
A young father, I've been blessed with two little girls
You two jewels more precious than diamonds or pearls
A part of me from a different perspective
And any woman that I'm dealin with is gonna have to respect it
On the outside there's negativity
Please killa cause on the inside
Me and my team'll make you feel it

[Chorus]
Make ya feel it, on the outside
And make ya feel it, on the inside
And make ya feel it, on the outside
And make ya feel it, on the inside
And make ya feel it..

[9th Prince - over chorus]
Word up,
It's like everyday, it's a struggle
Like floatin in a bubble
Burnin on the rocks, sticks and stones
And all that..

Aiyyo, aiyyo
Mom I'm suspended from school
Boy I'm tired of your shit, black woman drivin the mothership
Own the company witcha man, incorporate
She told me I was handsome -- I know I look funny with big lips
But that's the love she had for her son, the 9th Prince
Forever you exist in my circumference
You left my brain numbness, at night sometimes I cry
Wipe the salty tears from my eyes,
and feel lies, life's no job
You caught up in the Beehive,
but mom, ever since you been gone ain't nothin changed
Rza got a new Range, I can't complain
Them fake cats, stay in they lane
Your grandaughter Angelica, is gettin bigger
More figures I gotta spend on Princess Corinthia
Pull LaVoyd pictures, back when fam was ghetto prisoners
Let's all hold hands, and sing for the listeners

[Chorus]
Make ya feel it, on the outside
And make ya feel it, on the inside
And make ya feel it, on the outside
And make ya feel it, on the inside
And make ya feel it..

Sometimes I catch myself sittin back,

Thinkin about where I'm at black
Trapped in the worst part

The type of shit a young black man gotta go through,
everyday of his life, no matter where we at
They say we sell crack
Yeah we do son, so what do you expect us to do about it
I gotta eat, I ain't tryna starve for government

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Alive, alive, when you face death, you feel alive
Kill it, kill it, channel your animal side
Fire, fire, it's time to start a riot

Unleash your wings
Unleash your soul
Unleash yourself
From the sun

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land
Too late to kill the flame that I fanned

I never stopped to notice the fire in your hand
A burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling, like Icarus to land

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

And you're local, and I'm global
That means worldwide like a rising tide
I'm gonna subside and rise again like clockwork

Nonviolent though, no violence, just styling ho
From the birthplace of MLK where everything ain't okay but KKK

Now this is the A-Town, come on the premises if you wanna
Play with death, you get stung like the Crocodile Hunter
Got them racks, slanging them packs and no we can't leave them sacks alone
Hired an assistant cause my weed need a chaperone
(Luda!) And then Big Boi will pass the lighter
I'm convinced that we started the California brush fires
One, two, and it don't stop, so many whips at my crib
Ya chick came, the bitch thought it was a road block
Spending cash so fast, you'd think I'm foolish
And I love chicks with ass so it arch like St. Louis
Got chicks hugging my nuts like a speedo
Cause when I'm on the mic, I go for broke like T.O
But we know I'm rich and pay the bills at my mother house
Atlanta cribs jealous cause I'm chilling at my other house
Yea you may be able to out-trap me
But none of you niggas will ever out-rap me

I keep it playa while some choose to play it safe
Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A

They stay out all night on the basketball court
Practising, and practising their jump shot
Practising their hook-shot
And practising and practising, and then they're qualified for the majors
Well why can't you stay up all night practising your multiplication
Practising your Chemistry, practising your Physics
Why can't you stay up practising that?
If practice makes perfect, then why do you just specialize in fun things
And not in the things that require effort, commitment, and sacrifice",In the a,

Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
This pussy wrecker and white water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to leave her swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What's up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
And creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Nigga know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggaz need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta click
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic

Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to

I'll box you in your muthafuckin mouth

My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin', speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife

Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus

Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talkin' about

Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches

Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'

And it's a damn shame

This game real, boy, you can get scarred and barred in it
If your heart ain't in it, caught up in this world spinnin'
Before you started you was finished, dehydrated and deplenished
Niggaz is all washed up without a swallow in they cup
'cause every time a chicken cluck, you trickin' a buck
You pressed your luck and got stuck, fuckin' up the re-up

That's the ones with big talk and no game
Spendin' chips but no change
All the dope and no caine, war stories but no pain
The same ones that pop lip then flag ship
Then gotta hip skip before real niggaz pop clips
You better hop hip

Got 'dro and plenty pills
Cuttin' blows, hoes and dip

Well, well, well, well

In God, I trust and in the crowds I bust
Smokin' weed to calm down, I'm so blown off dust
It's harder to feel pain when my brains is mush
I know it's fucked up, how fathers turn they back on us

And our sick sad mamas smoking crack on up
Slime-ass po-po right in the back of us
Connected muthafuckas got better crack than us
But rich muthafuckas ain't gon' mash like us
Hear sirens coming and continue to bust

Lustful ways, livin' in these mistrustful days
Who said crime don't pay, niggaz out here cockin' K's
Don't drop, they spray, one shot, you lay, toxic waste
One pine box, one case, I'll block yo place

I beat niggaz senseless for Jordans and sixty dollars
Pinned hoes' toes to the earlobes and collars
In the back of a Impala, all to deliver pain
Twist her frame and hear her holler
So savage that it's gettin' harder

For me to see redemption in tomorrow
So far from God that I'm finding righteous paths hard to follow
I'm gulping vodka, I'm killin' sorrow in the bottom of a sky bottle
So depressed and sick and Slimm young and gifted
I'm just sick and twisted

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well

Corner-clockin', in the backroom work-choppin'
From Biscayne to Boat rockin', one-stop shoppin'
Guarded by glock and cash, ain't no stoppin'
They party pill-droppin' till all the drawers droppin'
'Droed up, my niggaz stay poured up, sho nuff

Hold up, big bank we fold up, so who wanna roll up?
We got that heat, so you better drop that beef
Before they pop and sweep your whole block in one heap

Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news

And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dying 'cause he thought could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down

I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scooby-Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'mma call Thelma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash, tryin' to get our stash back
Roundin' up suspects, collectin' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby-Doo when you need 'em
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on

Oh break it down, lookin' over yonder 'til the walls come tumblin' down

Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' bout hoes and dough again
Yup! Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin', about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin'
Twinkies shinin', pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin' down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin' tags

[Chorus]

It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin' and pickin' up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes I remember havin' rocks in the hall
Onn the glimmer with the glock by the ball
Servin' up a jab and workin' security six to six
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
to the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a console full of ammunition and funds
Mink Roc-a-Wear and some guns
Petty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax
and Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

[Chorus]

Uh-huh, whattup? Tell you somethin' 'bout me...
My throwback game is whiffle wicked
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number twenty Mark Spitz'n
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin Nu*Wear fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin'
Keepin' coke in the kitchen
Keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest
tucked underneath my Michelin S
I, travellin', handlin' with a forty-five cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin' hot through your motherfuckin' iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that
Talk 'til the paper fat
I rock somethin', roll chief Sacks like Daddy Fat!

[Chorus]

Pop tires in reverse, you'll be needin' a nurse
Leave you layin on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse
I know you want to blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox thinkin' a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means movie date, dinner date, lunch date, help me please

My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FEO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin'
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a little bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit
Dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'
A miracle happenin
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin' and smabbin'
Pop that tag on some of this game
Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game, juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, BOOM

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you

Welcome to the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Anything goes strippers and live shows
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Ecstasy, hydro, and good blow
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Hoes strip, where pimps and hoes do strolls
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Where hustlas collect rocks and straight rolls

Welcome home motherfuckers your back again
Into the den of inequity the life of sin
Where after the after party and the hotel lobbies
Probably find me drunk off Bacardi in a swank hotel
An aspiring actress
Trying to push her back through a thousand dollar mattress
In Chicago a couple of bottles, couple of models, stolen Diablos
Fast and furious going full throttle
Post club function, pills get swallowed
Ladies get loose and so do bra staps
Power, money, and sex drive good raps
Freaks emerge in a twilight with party pack
Of hydros alcohol blurred eye sight
From dusk til dawn is when vampires roam
Pro athletes trick and don't go home

[Chorus]

Riding with my nigga Big Boi you don't sleep
Even partied with Diddy up in NYC
Got drunk, rubbed titties of Dominican freaks
Every night bachelor party in the boom boom room
On trees get burned or liquor consumed
You ain't really seen a color till you seen it on shrooms
Lipstick on the pale of my Pelle Pele
Spot hotter than fish scales cooked in coked ale
Vampire party and we gets it down
In the undergrounds underground
Underground in club commer's basement
Ladies and low lifes do get wasted
So high you can't hear the music but you feel it when the bass hits
The atmosphere like the first year
Freak bass hit everybodys heart goes fast
Rolling Mitsubishi's shakin' that ass

[Chorus]

Got twenties on the Escort, bitch park my shit
It's Bizzare from D12 in this bitch (yeah)
And which nigga want to fight (what!)
I'm the club with Suge Knight, Ike, and Killer Mike (how does it feel)
Fat dick for all my enemies
Caught a disease fucking Roy and Jazzie T (a ha ha)
My girlfriends a fucking fool
When she turned her back
I'm making out with her mother like I'm in high school (shhh)
And I don't sale crack to my African brothers
I sell it to they mothers and they ex-lovers (that's true)
So go ahead bitch pop the X
So I can work your neck in the back of my Vett (ahh!)
Red bones, I hate 'em no question
I like fat bitches with bladder infections (ughh)

It's the creep show, show your nasty titties

Ryan pump blast shattered glass in the classroom
Penny tried to hide in a bathroom, 
Homicide scream from the hand held dragon
Mental flame from the barrel claim 25 angel, mercy
Long as the black board, splatter with his inside
Never had a chance to ride his new skateboard
Billy didn't shake lord, he fell silent
Died in the pantomime of cold violence
His killer didn't even blink, he couldn't think
Even when he heard the sirens kept firing
Pupils dilated, possessed and perspiring
He grew up admiring, 30 auts and calicos
are-15 and long barreled 44's so on the story goes
He went out in a blaze of glory
He went out in a front page story
He went out in a front page story

But to the mother fuckas who took Frank Williams AKA Fast Black, FUCK YOU! (Gunshot)

Dear God, I've messed up again, I'm sassed up again
Vodka spilling out my mouth onto my chin
I've slipped into the darkness of the heartless
Those barbarians carry savage weapons and they start shit
They hearts is cold as the artic, these men motivate mobs to lynch
These monsters are men, who I hang with
These monsters of then are who I bang with
Who I bang with, Crips, Bloods, BG, VL we have created our own road to hell
We train to kill and not to feel, reacting with a mac
But no matter who I kill I can't bring my nigga back
My niggaz dead and I can't get my fucking head around it
We was just smoking blunts of the best chronic
And now I'm wearing a t-shirt with his picture on it
Staggering about to vomit, consumed with vengeance
With my vengeance I'm all consumed, by mid afternoon smoking blunts in my room
To whom ever this letter may concern
When bullets strike they burn more than the flesh of the ones hit
You took my nigga my heart split, its broken, shattered in a million pieces
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, just help me Jesus, thug niggaz killers
They victims was screaming help me Jesus

Leaders of the new south, fake niggaz move out
He talkin loud and proud, but he scared with a tool out
I'm the nigga they be askin what we gon' do bout?

Mike told me ""fuck them niggaz, bring that new new out""
Tank the chevy, buy the caddie, bring the 22's out
Put the city back on top, just separate the fools now
We had lots of misrepresentation but hey we cool now

Can't keep playin both sides of the fence, you got to choose now
The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake
If ya got it on ya chest, shawty say it to my face
When ya hold ya nuts in hatred, ya only rushin til ya wait
And we goin' show them people what it really is in the a

I'm mashin with pops fashion, bustin first no questions askin
You goin' off that waterboat and thinkin you can hold me
I'm, king kong on every track, no cap-sule can hold me

I'll thump thump thump thump, when I bump bump bump bump!
It's woofers, tweeters, speakers, geekers, all in yo' trunk!
My dad ain't raise no fag, my mom ain't had no punk
We don't hesitate or negotiate, we pop chevy trunks

From the home of coca-cola, I'm not referrin to soda
I'm a grind til I shine, or die going for mine

'Cause there is, now way now how - I stay low-key, low-brow
In that black on black on black in the 'lac 'cause I'm so wild

I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss
They put me hot on list, where players are posted
But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted

And the prayer get toasted, 'cause I keep the flame on
The face for the game on - leave a stain on anything I puts my name on
Disrespect and the tech'll peck a player like woody
'Cause cain't nuttin keep a trill nigga down, ask khujo goodie

The debate is now, who's the greatest emcee?

(Killer Mike talking on the phone)
Aight... so you niggaz want to know how a nigga is up in jail...
Servin' a 40 to life sentence...
For dope that wasn't even his
Just sit back and listen, I'll tell you
It's a hilarious day boooyyy, and it's a wild, wild chain of events
that get yo ass in hea...

[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't want to sell, birds no more
(I got a fuckin' funny story to tell you)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(You rem'ber me and big Paul and my whole crew nigga?)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(Government snitches are amazin...)
Mama, I don't want to sell, crack no more
(Just listen, only take about 3 minutes, just listen)

[Verse 1]
After high school, I gained lots of weight
And I ain't talkin' bout calories put on by steak
The recipe I'm cookin' may send me upstate
Use bakin' soda, cook the pie, collect cake
Now Pillsbury, these niggaz kick down doors
Find out what mills bury
Shit's very intense and criti-cal
And when we drew pistols shit got piti-ful
The first lick was bullshit, a half a brick
We robbed the middle man and a bum bitch, the dumb bitch
But between me and him and that hoe
We walked away with 18 and a bigger score
Some nigga named Salvatore from El Salvador
Got silver teeth and a scar on his jaw
Young Antonio Montana, held up mansion north Atlanta
We hit'em hard as doors hammer, yea!

[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't want to sell, birds no more
(Okay, I know whachu thinkin', it's on righ, we on righ, we on)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(Hold up, hold up, hold up, be patient, be patient, listen to the rest
listen, listen)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(Man I feel like a asshole just tellin' you this man)
Mama, I don't want to sell, crack no more

(Tell the kid to give me the card, check it out
here's where it gets interestin, follow this shit)

[Verse 3]
??? the spot had more birds than a pet shop
More gunz than a Vietnam vet, we was set
Loaded up the work and let's jet
My nigga big Paul loaded up the you-Haul
A thousand pounds uncut raw
Hold on, whus that I saw in the distance?
Did he have a crew offerin assistance?
Paul said it's prolly nuthin', a small animal or somethin'
My nerves got to jumpin', I swear I heard somethin'
I pointed the 4-5th in the wind and started thumpin'
The blue lights is comin', my crew is runnin'
Cops is everywhere, they keep comin'
All of us sick, and all of us caught, holdin our dick
We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin FEDs hit
We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin FEDs hit
Me and Salvatore fucked up in the mix
That middle man and dumb bitch
Them niggaz snitched, GOD DAMN!

[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't want to sell, birds no more
(So young man, that's why the fuck I'm sittin here wearin these pants ???)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(I hear Salvatore got ??? or some shit)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(The bum bitch that snitched, tss... who knows?)
Mama I don't want to sell, crack no more

(Man I shoulda fuckin stayed in job corp
stayed my fuckin ass in job corp, doin dumbass shit

But I'm ya nigga, and you a perfect drug
Make a nigga heart quiver
You a hard breakin hard liquor on my liver

Body dark like a Cognac, I'm pissy drunk
In light ??, I stay drunk

You a vicious mind-bending ??
You the perfect drug, ultimate high, and I'm a fiend

Either that or you the devil's daughter, can't fake it
Killing me slow, I know and I can't shake it
Please stay, please leave, please don't go
Please walk away and let me be to die slow
This love is deeper than the grave and it's forever
Snake pit, you're venom beyond measure
Pandora's box a lot, my treasure
If love is strong as the grave, make me deader
Jezebel got my soul and my cheddar
Every time I beat it down, it jumps wetter
Like a dark cloud, bringing me pain and bad weather
I remain inside of your rain with no umbrella
I couldn't write the words, I blame this letter
Til death do us part, we deserve to be together

A living drug, you're the bitch I hate to love
Learned to suck good dick by fuckin' thugs

Breaking D-boys, MCs, and athletes, but not me
Told you from the start this shit is forever
We gon' go through this bad weather together
Whether the road or high side, you gon' ride
Through the fistfights and black eyes, it's you and I
Ike and Tina, our love is measured on a milimeter
They say a partner don't love a nigga til a nigga eat her
But I'm raw, and tired of the motherfuckin talking
I'll be goddamned if you hit the door walking
I'm stalkin, the depths of Atlantis, evil enchantress
Slick and underhanded
Fuckin with you like dancing with the devil, no command bitch

Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin

Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds

I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider

I step into the club, in a fresh white T 
Looking for a one night wife, to delight me 
A lot of dudes claim, to be gangsta like Ice-T 
When in actuality, they sweeter than ice tea 
Get your weight up homie, only the strong survive 
Get off the bus and pay your dues, you don't belong on this ride 
I'm a full time playa, all about my hustle 
Demonstrating my muscle, if I get in a tussle 
If you got plex, I suggest you keep it hush-hush 
Cause boys wet up on that water, and you might get bust 
I got to stay up on my note, so my game is sharper 
I can't be wiped out, I'm like a permanent marker 
Boys mean mugging in the club, repping they hood 
It's understood but cross that line, homie it ain't good 
It's survival of the fittest, I'm the last one breathing 
While you in your bed sleeping, I'm still out here creeping

Join Mase and Bethle-fuck him, I'm trying to get cheddar 
My stack will clearly show, my talent for moving blow 
And it's gangsta music, so fuck the status quote 
Grown men talking, who let the children in 
Get the nine to spit it in, leave him smelling like chit-lens 
I ain't playing I ain't joking, I'm rolling loaded and open 
It's best you not provoking, this man when he pistol toting 
The 4-fiftha, will tuck turn toss twist you 
Split you right down the middle, like a brand new swisha 
When the bullet hit you nigga, it rip and tear tissue 
Bullet bang, turn brains into baby batter 
Turn great matter, into antimatter 
Fuck your chitter-chatter, who's good better best badder 
Let the shotgun splitter splatter, who it hit child or bitch 
It don't matter, niggaz just handling bis' 
Primetime guerilla gang, get his what it is 

Last but not least, it's H.A. Dub 
Buckshot slugs, you covered in blood 
Feel me cuz, or get drug in the mud 
By these Texas thugs, who really don't show no love 

That's what it is nigga, handle your bis nigga 
This ain't your year nigga, I'll split your wig nigga

The American dream I'm with niggas is visioning
You clowns ain't making it rain it's just drizzling
Acting like I ain't paid what you talking bout

Got over thirty movies what you think you doing to me
You sold a couple records how you think you gon' do me
You know I'm in shape I slap you you gon' try and sue me

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game, juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, BOOM

Walking right, now to take flight, they ain't gotta go home

Smelling like hen and a mix of hydroponic by the the time

Woo, tell em what it is man (tell em what it is).

Welcome to the New World Order.
Atlanta, Georgia.

Houston, Texas, he already know.

The south is takin' over.

[Chorus: x2]
Just look over your shoulder (shoulder)
Let me see who just showed up (showed up)
It's the southern takeover (its over)
You betta' tell em I got drinks 
That stand on top try and stop (pop pop pop)

It's the mister fo' fifth told 'em
Cookin' coke with baking soda
Dub roller, pro smoker
Wood gripper, pistol whipper.
Muck a nigga if he figure
Fuckin' with my figures.
Makes him richer, he should know.
Instead, it'll make him better than a slimy fuckin' with my money.
Get yo money stacked right outta Sunday school
On a bright and sunny Sunday.
This ain't funny.
I ain't jokin' bout my coke and package come up shorter.
Might kidnap yo wife and daughter.
Bury them down deep in Georgia.
No D.A.s a fuckin' lawyer prosecutin' witnesses.
We excutin', start the shootin, start the lukin',
Start the violence, start a riot.
Get this motherfucker crunker, crunk as you can get it.
Pass that dro, I'm a hit it.
Outta line, we gon' spit it,
spit it vivid, cause i live it.
You don't walk it, you just talk it.
Pistol totin', and a loadin'.
That's how smokin' got this dope
And i ain't hopin', steady slangin'
Right on yo trappa block.
Try your trap, set up shop.
Try and stop (pop pop pop).

[Chorus]

Hey hey, this ain't about an image.
This ain't about a gimmick.
Pussy's stand to the side.
Now the game got a menace.
I damn seen a city that I think is not the realest.
We bummin' on his ass.
He ain't finishin' his sentence.
I only got a minute.
I feelin' about a digit.
You lookin' at a nigga like I ain't about to get it.
I'm lookin' at the money like I ain't about to finish.
You need to mind your business.
If you ain't about your business.
I'm a H-town soldier.
I'm a come with the trunk up yeah I'm a gon' remind ya.
If you ain't gettin' it you shoulda told ya father.
Nigga chamillionaire never show no problems.
You don't want no problem (problem).
Get em g'ed shoulda let the fo' fo' remind 'em.
Ya you tip on the ride em.
I be ridin' fo' fo's on the door beside 'em.
6' 6"" tall lookin like he a center.
Tear tattoo's lookin' like he a killa.
Skinny ass niggas don't fight with a nigga.
Pull out a billfold, put a price on a nigga.
I have this camp fo' put a knife in a nigga.
From the car to his pocket then right in your liver.
Was a big boy that put a slice in the middle.
Ya head fast think you hold a mike with the killa.
Don't mess with the south homie, thats a dream,
Hallucinate or imagining so.
Double X.L. with the gats I mean,
Keep somethin' ready to blow in the magazine.
And you know that southern cash is mean.
Franklins frown for me when I stash my cream.
Pull up in candy paint that match my green.
Killer, Pastor, and Koopa are the master machine.

[Chorus]

[Pastor Troy]
Y'all know me, it's P.T.
Well I un huh and all of that,
Black on black, with black tip.
I can't help but represent.
I'm not content, I want more.
Who the fuck you take me for?
Studio rappers not the fortay.
drop my top and bust my A.K.
No mo play, in G.A.
Yeah, that's a classic.
Ridin' in the classic.
Totin' me a classic
Send em to the casket.
Send em to the morgue.
Slap me a nigga cause I'm motherfuckin' bored.
Chamillionaire, I camouflage in my surrounding.
Get my desert E's and get to motherfuckin' poundin'.
Up and down the streets,
Throwin' heat, out the driver's seat,
Ridin' to the beat,
Tell them nigga just lay weak.

You can catch me all in a nigga house wit a black tee

Black Tee, black rag, even got a black mask
Leaving out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag
Black 'lac, black tag, fin' to hit a lick again
You a head bussa put yo hand wit yo fist den
Franchise hate me, probably wanna kill me
Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me
Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt
Gucci so gutter he'll steal money out ya purse
Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt
Black tee, black beat, trapping on the front street
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me
Bubble gum wappin' ass niggas can't smoke me

It's Bun B in his black tee & G in his black tee
Repping UGK and BAT in his black tee

Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee
Gucci chain swinging on the front of his black tee
Cadillac swinging, smoking blunts in his black tee
Stunt in his black tee, Ball in his black tee
It ain't just me pimping we all got a black tee

And I got a 1-2 Bun

Say it again dog to make sure that you heard me
Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey

Kick doja to ya house n put it to a cataract
Gorillas wit banana clips going monkey in the back
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze]
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee
Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street
Chilling by a black Cadillac on sum black feet
Scrappy in a Chevy watching Scarface on the flat screen
Told y'all constantly, ride wit the pump wit me
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath
I ain't gotta keep telling y'all niggas I'ma G
I'ma just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth

[Chorus]

[Verse 6: 4-Tre]
I'm s-stainless in my black tee
Remaining in my black tee
On the grind cause I like to shine in my black tee
Diamond glistening cross plus the background is a black tee
Thieve then come back spraying rounds in my black tee
4-Tre, I want war in my black tee
Fuck them, probably never wore a black tee
Working in my black tee, smoking purple in my black tee
I'm looking for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee

[Verse 7: Lil Scrappy]
Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on
Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm going straight for the bread home

Cause now Raheem'll show ya punk ass a tree
Bust nuts in my black tee, sluts in my black tee

We spent summer dreaming, when we could be leaving,

As its on type of nigga for the home invasion surprise
Mother fucker pow-pow lay the fuck down now
Now no, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non violent, positively vibing
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you,
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really suppose to handle it,
Pardon me one moment I just went off on a tangent

Typical day off in the A, aye
But nicks up the Chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill,
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill,
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes,
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust there motherfucking head, ha ha ha ha ha ha

That I am the greatest of all time forever and ever

To make it out the ice cold streets of the city
You better have a Christopher word game, witty
You better have a dance game similar to Diddy
Or play b-ball above the rim like Smitty

Gave my young boi three of them in the mall

You don't like the prestige that I have in life.
You don't like the notoriety.
You detest the fact that I got more cars than most of you have friends!
I got a big house on the big side of town
I got life pretty much the way I want it!

To make it out the ice cold streets of the city

Can't love life suckling on mama's titty
'Cause life is a bitch and a bitch ain't with it
You gotta have faith livin' life on Biggie

I asked for six figures, God gave back self
I'm on my way to heaven in a Porsche 911
Buried in my car, I'm surrounded by a harem
Surrounded by my brethren, my funeral is legend
Buried like a Pharaoh with my jewelry in the desert
The government will hate me like Jesus, but fuck 'em
I did it for the grind, I did it for the hustle
I did it for the people on the bottom in the struggle
I did it for my comrades, did it 'cause I love 'em

Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte

Killer Mike,"Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, ""This where little dogs sit""
Pointed at the yard, said, ""That's where big dogs shit""
He said, ""Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen""
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Pretty nigga, let him be fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to round up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey, the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my clip before that five go bang
Bang bang, guap time, rep game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dope country niggas, but them niggas ain't weak
Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

And you know just how it go

Killer Mike,"I woke up this morning to a cop with a gun
Who told me that he looking for a nigga on the run
I thought for a second and I screwed my face
And asked the dirty pig “Why the fuck you in my place?”
He said “Chill or we kill, this is a warning”
Then I told him “fuck you, Where is the warrant?”
Then they got to punchin’ and kickin’ and macin’
Then the whole situation went Larry Davis
Thinking ’bout my lady and thinking ’bout my baby
Thinking “these two motherfucking pigs going crazy”
They wanna kill a nigga ’cause a nigga on this rap shit
Wanna leave me dead on a mattress, Hampton
I’m a Public Enemy because I’m cold lampin’
And I don’t give a fuck about a party in The Hamptons
And I don’t give a fuck about a motherfuckin’ Forbes List
Far as I’m concerned, that’s a motherfucking whores list

Motherfucker, my dad was a cop
You don’t think I know a dirty ass cop when I see one?
Shake down, take down, disrespecting-the-badge-ass-bitch!

Back to the scene going wild in the bedroom
Grab the cop’s gun left from leaking with a head wound
Second cop shot, but the bullet hit his partner
Shot him in the leg and he hit him in the arter(y)
Now the dirty cop’s looking at me
Talking ’bout he kill a nigga if I try to flee
Shit, I’m about to loose it, so he gon’ have to prove it
All because the government hate rap music
I’ve been labeled outlaw, renegade, villain
So is Martin King, so the system had to kill him
A nigga with an attitude, the world gotta feel him
Educated villain, attempt on living
If I gotta kill a cop just to get out the building
That mutherfucker didn’t, left dead, no feelings
Yelling “Fuck him” as I buck A 45 at his fillings
Trying to knock his brains through the motherfucking ceiling

When I surface on the streets I can hear the crowd yelling
And see the neighborhood snitches pointing and telling
I’m bailing like a felon or Assata Shakur
Before the law leave me stinking like a bag of manure
Like Jeriko One in the movie ‘Strange Days’
They want a nigga dead ’cause the things that I say
Might make the youth go and pick up an AK
Tell the government “Fuck you, no way”
Like John Connor mama I be running everyday
‘Cause if I get caught it’s my life they terminate
Or stick me in a cell on Guantanamo Bay
All because a nigga won't sit in and obey
I’ll be an outlaw before I ever behave
And die a free man before I live like a slave
Nothing changes, if they catch me today
“Fuck the police” is still all I gotta say",Don't Die,2012
Killer Mike,"And I'm sitting on the edge of my bed holding my head
Trying to make this cake like a baker
And get some bread
My mama said hustlin' does come with feds
Time do the crime you better had be prepared
For what comes with it the killing the court convictions
Snorting, bitches, the snitches often they get acquitted
While the real sent to prison, to rot away while they living
And all because I say dope shit they on a mission
To nail my black ass to the wall with a conviction
I pray the Lawd hear me but really Lawd is ya listen'n
Praying when I'm in trouble I'm speaking with forked tongue
I say I'm out the game but I'm flinching like George Jung
I must be in the clutches of Satan it's all warm
My mama took you to the ""root lady"" to read my palm
She puts beads on my neck saying they protecting me from harm

Looking at the bezel of my Breitling
Thinking that I used to sell raps for enlightenment
But I got lapped by them guys selling lies for the white man
Now I sell pies for the white man
And my tour bus is a moving indictment
This must be how Huey felt when the revolution failed
And in Oakland nigga turned him on to a sack of yayo
You know this feeling false but it feels like yeah
I may have lost my cause but not a reason to rebel
Revolutionary or drug dealer I'm in jail
And the C.O.'s call me nigga either way when I'm there
Just like they did Pac
Just like they do Mumia
Just like they doing to Mutulu or Assata if they see her
And ain't no justice if it's just us in court
For my folk and my people free Hoover, free Fort

Don't know if she black or a white chick
But I know this pussy and excitement
Gonna lead to indictments

I done seen dark days come to many bright men
I done seen a damn dime fine
As a fine wine take an Einstein mind
Leave 'em deaf dumb blind
Fuckin with them jezebel whores
Liars of Delilah even marrying a Pandora
Pretty parasite she will use ya, this ain't what you used to
Stone cold bitch she Medusa
Dope ass pussy might make you an abuser

Killer Mike,"The ballot or the bullet, some freedom or some bullshit
Will we ever do it big, or keep just settling for little shit
We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers
We all talk having greens, but none of us on acres
If none of us on acres, and none of us grow wheat
Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat
So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding
Cos all we seem to give them is some balling and some dancing
And some talking about our car and imaginary mansions
We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting
Hella children deaf and pretending it's exciting
We are advertisements for agony and pain
We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang
We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game
Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine
In the 80's when the bricks came on military planes

The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like number twelver
Old enough to understand the shit'll change forever
They declared the war on drugs like a war on terror
But what it really did was let the police terrorize whoever
But mostly black boys, but they would call us ""niggas""
And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers
They boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches
And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches
And they would take our drugs and money, as they pick our pockets
I guess that that's the privilege of policing for some profit
But thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits
Cos free labor is the cornerstone of US economics
Cos slavery was abolished, unless you are in prison
You think I am bullshitting, then read the 13th Amendment
Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits
That's why they giving drug offenders time in double digits
Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor
Just an employee of the country's real masters
Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama
Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters
If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic
Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi
We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan
And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran
They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor
If I say any more they might be at my door

Hope? Nah, ha ha, slow down with the jokin' shit
So inappropriate, right behind your ears is a what?
Look, ta-dah! The sound of your hopelessness
I can feel it too, from the ground rising up in us
Right above the clouds there's a shroud there to smother us

We don't believe in the same shit anyway, Run the Jewels is not for your children

How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm
Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control
I got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started

You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think
You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing
Man after everything we will never be the same
Man I'm tired of tellin' lies, know you sick of playin' games
I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it
Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it
I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill
In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real
How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill
My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is
Shawty, I die, kill, for you if you keep it real
Go to jail, even if I gotta kneel I will

I love you and I know you love me too
(I love you shawty)
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay
(I know you love me)
So that we can be together forever

I can't see you with no me
But, you left me and I'm just me
So, I'm gon' be what they gon' be
And I know he want you but they want me
Girl, together or apart
But you be forever in my heart, I swear
And even if we end up here, I know it hard
I never love that way again, I swear to God
I be breaking down, you be playing hard
She chose to bid it all, watch how you play your cards
Now you runnin' 'round town with education hatin' broads
Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved?
And you can't say that I ain't changed
Your whole life since we met that day
And when we get it right, God bless that day
But until then, shawty, I just pray
And I just say

I love you and I know you love me too
(I love you shawty)
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay

Where we come from we don't fuck with no polices
We pay their salary and they pay us back with mistreatment
Now peep this, Sandra Bland hanging in the cell
But just the day before she calling her mama for bail, hell
Now they get nervous when niggas in Ferguson
Get to popping the trunk, bust back and try to service them
Let's turn the tables like some brawlers in a bar fight
They killed Tamir Rice in plain sight and said it was alright
Now the people taking it to the streets because they're uptight
Now let the tear gas fly while the canines bite

It ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun
I see what's happening, I can read between the lines
It ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun
This time around the revolution televised

Standing outside school, got the clapman
Twelve roll by, woop woop Pacman
Do a turn around, roll up in they ass man
'Ay, what's your name?
And why don't you pull your pants up?'
Ay, I'm a kid and I'm scared, I don't answer
This sucker nigga tried to put me in some hand cuffs
I'm scared as fuck so I buck, I don't a give a fuck
I feel that dirty offer reaching for his ray gun
I grab his pepper spray, find his eye, spray some
Fight for my life like a mother fucking Trayvon
Fight for my life like a mother fucking Mike Brown
'Cause I refuse to be the next nigga shot down

It ain't no fun when the rabbit's got the gun
I see what's happening, I can read between the lines

Killer Priest,"See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'ma inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Fuck, shit up on the hurry up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowin' niggaz back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill
60 Second, nucleus, attack on your set
Hit you with the blast

Killer Priest,"Now number two, practiced the snake style
	He was known as the snake spirit
	He had the speed of a snake

[Intro/Verse One: Killah Priest]
Niggaz is like serpents out there
[snake style, no one could compete]
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo

It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He was just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standin when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors, by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we plan to make grands of our home
[Number two]

[Verse Two: The RZA]
Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manor
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggaz he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggaz be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S.
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
in his country, even though he sold mad weed
for the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggaz actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
at the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the CREAM
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggaz I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
without a doubt, niggaz who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
and you don't know no fuckin lessons?
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse Four: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggaz comin through the trees, like a salamander, bitin
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!!
I turn into the demon beast, yo

Yo fuck that shit!

[Verse Five: Buddah Monk]
Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggaz try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's yacub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop, lyric skills, brothers say, Buddah chill!!

with the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
machine guns ready to go

Are you ready
Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
and kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
you can treat him bad and leave him

Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Because I'm easy come,easy go,
A little high,little low,
Anyway the wind blows,doesn't really matter to me,

Mama,just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,
Mama,life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on,carry on,as if nothing really matters

Too late,my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die

Haunting you
And then the song became alive - song and dance

Then my ancestors awake
(then I forgot myself)
And in our joy they take their joy

Lovers frail and naked move like pawns on chessboards

Where have we all come from? Where are we all going?

I look through your mind and tears run down
And under the skies and tears run down.

I will try to understand
Share your grief and your confusion, compassion in us cries
No divine intervention, only moves on black and white

Monopolise the holy ground, all that we hold as sacred

And the homelands in our hearts will never fade away
Let the legends promise me the earth shall rise again
And homelands in the hearts of men shall never fade away.

And all the things I hold so dear to me

Faced east to the rising sun

But I looked out the window
And all I could see
Was the face of a girl
She was looking at me

She was begging for food
Then I knew I had found
The weeping god
In the face of a child

As she gestures with her fingers
Her little brother followed suit
And all I did was take my camera
So the image never fades away

I no longer saw the great gate of the sun
Nor the dawn of time when our race had begun
Just black eyes like starving dogs looking at me
A weeping god was all I'd ever see

And as I sat in contemplation beyond all charity
Losing the magic and meaning of living
(the earth and the stars these things are mine)
And when they've drained the earth of all resources
We'll face the music still
For you and I shall be striking memories
In the thoughts of our children's children

I had arrived at my destination
At the gate of the rising sun
We shall again regain in sunset that balance
That we left undone

I stared at the shacks and the shanty town mess
I couldn't help but to think of the West
The balance was lost and my reason went wild
As the weeping god came alive in the child

I began to weep
And I remember the violation

Of lands untouched and ways to come always maybe
But choking on promises meant for the deal
Thinking again the darkest hour before the dawn

Confirming fears that from the dawn of time have been
Retracing footsteps in dark chambers of grey lands
And through the madness through the terror we must pass
As if awaiting sunlight that may never come

In time we face ourselves with all our faults and fears
Now that I know the final conflict is within
I recognize the faces of my friends and hear the call

Killing the Dream,"I'm running out of distractions to keep me from the truth, and I'm running out of places I can go to stay away. This broken glass has only sharpened with the years, and I can't remember how it looked before it fell so fast. What will become of this when I'm gone? It's sad to say, but from here, there's not much left anyways. But tonight I'm staying in, it's warmer than outside. And thoughts can't echo off the walls like through the air. If you can't read this, it's because my hands are shaking from the cold of another night alone. So tell me that to dream about tonight, because I never got that far on my own. And God, hold onto me tonight. Pull me close before I slip away. I've truned from you, but it might not be too late. And maybe this is wrong, but if it all goes as planned, you'll never know I'm gone.




",The Escape,2004
Killing the Dream,"And now you've come so far and climbed so high, and all it cost were the words we built ourselves up on. Another step. Just one more time. Why turn back now? As you're starting to forget something we lost so long ago. But we remember the taste of our blood, you taught us all so well. Exhale. It's gone. One breath and four years lost. Did you miss us as we fell through the cracks of your lies? But we found a home in the lowercase letters of words you'll never read and songs you'll never hear. And you'd remember, but we've bit our tongues for so long now that we forgot what we had to say. We're spitting blood and you can't see. But now we know tomorrow means nothing if we all die today. But we won't die today. This doesn't die today.




",Picking Up the Pieces,2004
Killing the Dream,"Your heart is breaking
Your head keeps pounding out
Spelling out what you know best
Every thing is just a mess
Some things are better left unsaid
And they'll run
But there's nothing you can do
The cuts and blood
And fading love
And empty words are real
And its nothing
But its something to be said
There's nothing to be said
The more we talk of yesterday
And all the things they used to say
The less we really hear ourselves
We are not the past
Because we are here today
And its worth wo much more than just two words
There's so much more to say
Lets let it go
They gave it up
Or is there nothing else to say?

And I'm still here
How long has it been since you've been at home with me?
I'm trying to hold on but I'm just keeping you away
You said ""I'm still standing, I'm just looking for a reason""

I'm standing right here
But I'm holding on too tight
You're looking right through me, or do you feel me at all?

and a brain supreme
you who am I?......Kilo the dream
That's right ha ha
that's it ha ha
some times a brother trips
I know you admire me
I didn't mean to dis you i'm sorry
I appologize, but you better recognize
what is crap if you don't know crap
what is rap if you really can't rap then
who in the hell said they wanted a little more
what in the fuck do you take me for?
i'll never go out for the die
and you you'll never take me alive
oh la, can you feel the party jumpin?.....ha ha

(chorus)x2

Say I, I made that pussy hurt
to sexy for my shirt
we didn't know know why
I put my dick on the side of her mouth
she came all down my pants
she got up and danced
and then she started sayin, oh ah, I love your ding a ling
she told the rest of the girls I was little
but I can go 24 in the middle
fuckin girls is part of my diiiiick
bumped de bump, remember that
from the back, looked kinda fat
GOOOOOOD-Damn!
Shi-Shi you made me scream
Shi-Shi was 17
Shi-Shi was a beauty queen
Shi is a name, budda G, budda G

Upside down cause it's not how it seems

I'm thinking all the time and I guess it shows
It's tough for us to go back in time
To the night before everything was fine
When you talked to me and I talked to you
We watched pedophiles on the morning news
And the water dripped from my faucet top
If I collect it all, could we get it back
Please

I'm not the kind to lose myself and behind
You gotta move and your body is the shape I want

Wasting my time with you, no
This only way to sunshine in my watch
Wasting my time with you, stop

Too much nerve coming into here
Turning loose and make a murder fear
God damn, boy, you so hot
It's no excuse to make my pole stop
I need a bit of coffee and a warm side
Dusty ideas only have spots
The verse I'm singing only half sung
High fretting in the mob's brow
Didn't mean to let it drift this far
I'm playing hard to get, you're playing your guitar
Damn, you should be so shy
Been working hard to drop me inside
Our dreams breaking all, breaking all my bones
Before I break it off, I break it off alone

Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the center of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go

I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'till we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more
Got it?

It's just like that
You promise her your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what this is about?
No? Well, work it out

Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright

Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're in bits, blow your nuts to a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do

Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,

Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather

And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail

She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.

Kim Burrell,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2009
Kim Burrell,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

You're the poets finest song
And like a painter you can move me with your sunrise
Touch me with the look I see in your eyes
And I fall again

In the silence after love
With the words that go unsaid I'll understand you
Things may not work out the way we've planned them to
But I'll fall again

Loves been called a game
Winner takes it all
And everyone who plays
Plays knowing he could fall
And if love's a game
I'd rather lose to you
Than win with someone else
And still be loving you

When the love songs have all been sung
And time has taken down its last December
You will be the one love I'll remember and I'll fall again
For like the fool I am
I'll be the pawn again
Move me as you will
I've always given in
And if love's a game
I'd rather lose to you
Than win with someone else
And still be loving you




",And Still Be Loving You,1975

When does a lover finally stop giving it one more try?
If holding you for a night or two is all I'm ever gonna see of you
You'd better love me up, and on the way back down
Give me something I need, something I ain't found

Just like a bad seed in the wind you keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out, I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind, and you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again
Darlin', come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again

I see the memories in your eyes do they keep you company
And I hear your temporary sighs callin' out to me
Givin' in is all I do, I give you more and you take it too
If that's the way that it's got to be
Come and take what you need, and take it good from me

Just like a bad seed in the wind you keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out, I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind, and you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again
Darlin', come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again

Damn, that ol' dream that you keep chasin'
So many things that I could have done
But I keep waiting, waiting

Just like a bad seed in the wind you keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out, I'll take you in

Time you found time enought to love
I found love enough to hold you tonight
I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you

Laying beside you
Lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm
Moving so right
Closing our eyes
And feeling the light
We'll just go on
Burning bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile
When you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you
Lost in a feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end

I'm waiting for the pain to go away
I though maybe that this would be the day
At noon I tried a little smile
Then I sat down and cried a while
Just waiting for the pain to go away

If I could only get you off my mind
But these old memories treat me so unkind
The way you laughed your gentle smile
Still makes me love you oh so much
I know that I can't get you off of my mind

I see happy lovers everywhere I go
Sharing dreams in a world for two
He holds her hand and she holds his
They never know how good love is
We lost the only chance for me and you

So I'm waiting for the pain to go away
But I'm afraid the blues are here to stay
Not many loves like ours around
So easily lost so rarely found
Just waiting for the pain to go away
To go away

Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do

Try to keep away the lonely night
Try to make you stay when you wanna go

Who ruined the music we thought was so special
Like fire between us spent over and over
Who emptied my bed and left me with nothing

From the mouth of the kiss that whispered forever
From the body of the soul that made my eyes listen
I'm hearing goodbye but I don't want to listen

Love will tear and do you in
Turn you inside out and when
All you got is less than dim
You know, you're grabbin' at straws
And you'd do it again

Hit and run, I never saw you coming
I ain't never play the part of the put down name
Strip to the heart with all my revenges
Laid across down the ground like master Vincent

Turn you inside out and when

So perfect in every way

Emerald eyes so cool
And so inviting--hide the side
She never shows

And I was feelin' down
The I thought about you
Like I always do
And I turned myself around

Ooh it was magic
Some kind of a dream
Somebody turned the radio on
It was our favorite spot
In the parking lot
I knew it was crazy
I knew I was gone

On the edge of the night
We had some kind of time
The two of us just holding on
When nothing else mattered
But the fire in our eyes
And singing our favorite song
Along with the radio

Don't wake me up
Just to break my heart
Cause I could stay here all night
Where memories are so sweet to me
You were the best thing in my life
And in the changin' times

But you've still got my heart
And if you're ever alone
I'm as close as your telephone

One of just me an you 
Cause no one ever makes me smile 
The way that you do
We could make it into an 8x10

And ride it to the moon

Sail it to the end of the sea

Holding on tight to me

When you're dying of thirst and drowning in maybe's
When nobody else can touch that part of you

Me I stood out here in the open
And offered the one thing that nobody else had broken
As if I didn't know what you might do, I might lose

I have broken every rule, the hard way for you
And I would do it all again
Just to spend the night with you

You took my love like a one armed bandit
Got reason to cry, got more than I can stand
And I'm going down for the third time over you

It hurts the most when the knife keeps coming
I was standin' still when I should have been running
As if you didn't know what I might do, I might choose

I have broken every rule the hard way for you
And I would do it all again
Just to spend the night with you

I would follow every road with nothing else in view
Just like the frozen willow bends I have
Just to spend the night with you

Do you love to watch me break
Do you just love to watch me ache
On the chances that I take

Do you love to watch me break in two

After all these years, love is still alive

As he tried to mend the sails
But a whim of the wind
Was too much for him

And empty are the molds where you place your head.
Do you really see a heaven in this sinking lead?

Are you lookin' in the dark, when you could see too far? Oh too far
Paradise is not a mask, but a single spark.
Rolling all around your a ball of steel,
Looking for the ground that you used to feel.
But this tasteless space you learned to shield,
Made you a faceless maze and you were forced to yield.

Are you lookin' in the dark, when you could see too far? Oh too far
Paradise is not a mask, but a single spark.
It is not home that you know,
It is not gold that you’ve stowed. You are strong and you have hope.
Now be strong enough to go, enough to go, enough to go
Why you lookin' in the dark, when you could see too far? Oh too far
Paradise is not a mask, but a single spark.
Why you lookin' in the dark, when you could see too far? Oh too far

Kim Churchill,"I was running for the hills, I knew no more about today
We came back with sinking froth, lead the way not much to say

Falling at my feet, I knew my time was going down, wasn't long
Sinking into me, what can I do for you and what do you want?
What do you love?

To my window to the sky
To my window to the sky
Falling down, I thought I had it all wrapped up inside my head
But I was rearranging thoughts for other's eyes instead
Falling at my feet, I knew my time was going down, wasn't long
Sinking into me, what can I do for you and what do you want?
What do you love?

To my window to the sky
To my window to the sky
To my window to the sky
And there were times when I thought I could hold somebody's hand,
That I deserved it and someone would understand
But I just seem to break the people that I find
To my window to the sky and I'm thankful for you today
To my window to the sky and you're right, I feel okay
A pair of diamonds in her eyes, will be so sure to walk away

Now only use four-letter words

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like,

When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her,

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Kim Crosby,"He's a very smart prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
I was caught unawares

And I thought, well, he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

You think, what do you want?
You think, make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
You think, well, it's a thought

What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who you were when you know
That you're not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if you are
What a prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which you don't?

So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where every thing's wrong?
Or where every thing's right
And you know that you'll never belong?

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's your first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary

And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
You'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose

So you pry up your shoes
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide
You know what your decision is
Which is not to decide

You'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe

In a stew, In the goo
And you've learned something, too
Something you never knew

Everybody, move ya body
Everybody, move ya body
Everybody, move ya body
I don't think twice, kid
You know I bring it to ya live

See, I don't get writer's block, yo, I block other writers
And there's been nights I had to wear sniper attire for biters
Don't make that same mistake and get scarred, retard
I see that tape you listening to got you thinking that you hard

But dig this, cut your hair and get your name on your stomach
I still find ways to make your whole rap career plummet
Maintain, I steal mics out of the frame
But now people think they know me, 'cause they know my real name

While I stay same doing shows and tours
Somewhere in a phat crib [Unverified] playing Sega in the dashboard
Styles of sword [Unverified] and flowing steadily
Trapping MCs in mazes forever like Frankie Beverly

You know the steeze, I'm bringing beats to they knees
Holacausting MCs and sees some g's before I breath
That's how it be, it's no doubt that I got to bring
It to your chest as I bring it to ya live

Everybody, move ya body
Everybody, move ya body
Everybody, move ya body
I don't think twice, kid
You know I bring it to ya live

So, from this point on until the day that they bury me
I'll still be on a hunt trying to snatch this currency
Putting my peeps on while friends turn fake
They get pissed thinking I be in Switzerland checking some real estate

Dropping LPs every year somewhere in a mansion
With a butler named Vincent Jeffrey Belvedere
I'm rare but rappers ain't trying to hear
The reason why their girl freestyle her number in my ear

It's my year, son and I ain't trying to slip
I'm trying to collect props and get not to stretch money clips
Honey-dips, I keep 'em on like low end
So, f-five-o Illegal, so we don't got to go there

It's so unfair, how I do wack crews shady
They want to be next up
Their style sucks like a new baby
They can't faze me, mics and man fusion
Beats I keep bruising
Do your thing and keep moving

Everybody, move ya body
Everybody, move ya body
Everybody, move ya body
I don't think twice, kid
You know I bring it to ya live

Hush


Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide
**That millions die from three lethal letters
He does shit to make it better
**And I'm thinking of you

[Chorus]
Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don't want to sacrifice
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

[Verse 2]
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know
That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the TV - the story repeats
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Think it's a waste of time to vote
She says the one that has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
**And I'm thinking who

[Chorus]
Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho)
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants heaven (Heaven)
If you don't want to sacrifice (Oh)
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing (My hand to my brother)
Oooooo-Hush (Hand to my sister)
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

Yeah, yeah

Looking real close and you showin' it around like you know me now
Look, look
Pumpin' up the land, sea and homes and bends, you don't know me now
Look, look
Close up to the skin, but I never let you in, I'm a secret cow
Look, look
Put away the gear, come on, come on over here, let me show you how

Blink at me
Blink at me good
Blink at me, blink at me, blink at me
Blink at me good

Look to the right
Look to the right
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
Get on your knees
Roll on over
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up

Look to the right
Look to the right
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up
Get on your knees
Roll on over
Let me get a close up
Let me get a close up",Close Up,2015
