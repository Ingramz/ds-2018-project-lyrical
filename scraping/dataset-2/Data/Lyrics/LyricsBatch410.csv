Jan Harrington,"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see

Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart",Put a Little Love in Your Heart,1998
Jan Harrington,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Jan Harrison,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street

Jan Horvath,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange 
When I try to explain how I feel 
That I still need your love after all that I've done 
You won't believe me 

All you will see is a girl you once knew 
Although she's dressed up to the nines 
At sixes and sevens with you 
I had to let it happen, I had to change 

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel 
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom 
Running around trying everything new 

But nothing impressed me at all 
I never expected it to 
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you 

All through my wild days
My mad existence 
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance 

And as for fortune, and as for fame 
I never invited them in 
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired 
They are illusions 

They're not the solutions they promised to be 
The answer was here all the time 
I love you and hope you love me 
Don't cry for me Argentina...... 

Don't cry for me Argentina 
The truth is I never left you 
All through my wild days 
My mad existence 

I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance 
Have I said too much? There's nothing more I can think of to say to you 
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true",Don't Cry For Me Argentina [From Evita],2002
Jan Horvath,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love [From Brigadoon],2005

Jan Howard,"I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be

When my feeble life is o'er time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shore to Thy shore
Just a closer walk with Thee...",Just a Closer Walk with Thee,
Jan Howard,"Darling oh darling where are you tonight don't you even miss me at all
You once danced with me and whispered tenderly that I was the belle of the ball
The belle of the ball now stands by the wall
You told me you love me and then let me fall
But my heart will yearn until you return and call me the belle of the ball

Young lovers dance by me with stars in their eyes as soft music flows through the hall
I'll keep watching the door till you come back once more
Then I'll be the belle of the ball
The belle of the ball,
Then I'll be the belle of the ball",Belle of the Ball,1962
Jan Howard,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget

Jan Howard,"Well hello there my it's been a long long time
How am I doing oh I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now and it seems that it was only yesterday
Gee ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that she's doing fine
I heard you told her that you'd love her till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me seems like just the other day

Gee ain't it funny how time slips away
Gotta know now if I'll see you around
Don't know when though I'll never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you that in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips away",Funny How Time Slips Away,1962
Jan Howard,"He called me baby baby all night long used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one day I awoke and he was gone now there's no more baby baby all night long
He called me baby baby all night long kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if he'd just come back home and call me baby baby all night long

He called me baby baby all night long build me up so high and made me strong
Now each time in dreams just like a song I still hear baby baby all night long",He Called Me Baby,1962
Jan Howard,"(Heartaches by the number heartache number one two three)
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you'd love me less each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
You said you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you'd love me less each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end",Heartaches by the Number,1962
Jan Howard,"Looking back over my life I can see where I caused you strife
But I know oh yes I know I'd never make that same mistake again
Looking back over my deeds I can see signs of wise girl heeds
But if I just have a chance I'd never make that same mistake again

Once my cup was overflowing but I gave nothing in return
Now I can begin to tell you what a lesson I have learned
Looking back over the slate I can see love turn to hate
But I know oh yes I know I'll never make that same mistake again
Once my cup was overflowing",Looking Back,1962
Jan Howard,"You're too many teardrops too late too many teardrops too late
If you hadn't been untrue then I'd still be a loving you
But you're too many teardrops too late

I got your letter yesterday read every word you had to say
But I heard them all before they don't fool me anymore
And you're too many teardrops too late
You're too many teardrops

My heart don't know what to do I still have this feeling for you
If I took you back again then you'd hurt me in the end
And you're too many teardrops too late
You're too many teardrops",Too Many Teardrops Too Late,1963
Jan Howard,"Somewhere outside the wind is wailing this time tomorrow you'll be sailing
Oh my love hold me as if it was our last time
Somewhere outside the bird is crying sounds like a million souls are dying
Oh my love hold me as if it was our last time
The trumpet sounds and you have things to do

Don't worry darling while you're gone I'll wait right here for you
Somewhere outside tomorrow's calling too many tears will soon be falling
Oh my love hold me as if it was our last time

The trumpet sounds
Hold me as if it was our last time hm hm",Last Time,1966
Jan Howard,"Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're going away but leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back

So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today

So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today",Put It Off Until Tomorrow,1966
Jan Howard,"Some people walk some people crawl some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in white some wrapped in fearful black
Time oh time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go

Some people never get some never give some people never die and some never
Live
Some folks treat me mean some treat me kind
Most folks just go their way don't pay me any mind
Time oh time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go

Sometimes I'm satisfied sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold sometimes it's hot
Sunset I laugh sunrise I cry midnight I'm in between and wondering why
Time oh time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go",Time,1967
Jan Howard,"If I cried every time you hurt me I'd be crying all the time
If I made a scene each time you're mean we'd be quarrellin' all the time
But I don't cry and I don't get mad I try to take the good with the bad
If I cried every time you hurt me I'd be crying all the time

Now and then you say you love me and I try to believe it's true
Then you turn right around and hurt me like I was nothing to you
But I love you so and I'll stay somehow my tears won't flow and my head won't bow
If I cried every time you hurt me I'd be crying all the time
Oh I'd be crying all the time",If I Cried Every Time You Hurt Me,1967
Jan Howard,"If time were not a moving thing and I could make it stay this hour
The love we share will always be there'll be no coming day
To shine a morning light make us realize all night is over
When you walk away from me there is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun that rises over land
I watch you walk away somehow I have to let you go now it's over
If you knew just how I really feel you might be turning yet
There are so many times that people have to love and then forget
There might have been a way somehow I have to force myself to say it's over

So I turn my back and turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence trying not to think at all
I send my feet before me walk the silence street before me now it's over
It's over oh it's over yes it's over",It's Over,1968
Jan Howard,"Are you going away with no word of farewell will there be not a trace left behind
Well I could've loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

It's a lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
Are you going away

As I walk alone my thoughts are tumbling round and round round and round
Underneath my feet a subway's rumbling underground underground
Are you going away

You got reasons of plenty for going this I know this I know
The weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go
Are you going away
You know that was the last thing on my mind",Last Thing on My Mind,1968
Jan Howard,"All the time yes darling all the time tenderly and constantly I'll love you
Every day I'll prove it every way in happiness or in loneliness I'll love you
Other arms may tempt me but don't let that bother you
For even if they tempt me I'll never be untrue
All the time yes darling all the time
Through the years through smiles or tears I'll love you
Other arms may tempt me",All the Time,1968
Jan Howard,"Found some letters you wrote me this morning they told of a love we once knew
Now they're gone I'd burned them to ashes don't want nothin' to remind me of you
Burning bridges behind me it's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me all I want is to forget you somehow

Sold the house we once planned together said goodbye to friends we once knew
Then I moved to a faraway city trying hard to forget about you
Burning bridges behind me",Burning Bridges,1968
Jan Howard,"You give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you think you know me well but you don't know me
No you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight

To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been but you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by the chance you might have loved me too

You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away with teardrops in my eyes

Jan Howard,"I've never seen the inside of a barroom or listen to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said if you can't beat 'em join 'em
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on we're gonna see a different me
Because your good girl's a gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingi'est swinger you've ever had
If you like 'em painted up hollered up then you oughta be glad
Cause your good girl's a gonna go bad

I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey in fact you'll hardly recognize your wife
I'll buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life
Because your good girl's,
Oh yes your good girl's a gonna go bad",Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,1968
Jan Howard,"My son my son I pray that you'll come home to me my son my son
It seems only yesterday the most important thing on your mind
Was whether you'd make the baseball team or get the new school jacket
Like all the other kids had

And I remember how your eyes lighted up when you got your first rod and reel
For that big fishing trip just you and your dad
And I remember wiping the tears away when you hurt yourself on your sled
In those days it seems the house was filled with laughter and joy
Filled with your friends and they were all such good boys
And then came the day that you walked down the aisle
To receive that all important diploma

I was so proud but I couldn't believe that tall young man was my son my wonderful son
And then I remember the little girl that was always around kinda tagging after you
She's not so little anymore but she's still around who knows maybe someday
Then you received the call that I guess we knew would come someday

But it came so quick and now you're so very far away
In the land that until a short time ago I didn't even know was there
I know the time will pass you'll be home again
But until that time my darling take care take special care
My son my son I pray that you'll come home to me my son my son",My Son,1969
Jan Howard,"Shame on me for hurting you what can I say what can I do
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me

You say you won't be seein' me again you say we're through
I wouldn't want to see the sunrise tomorrow if I knew that to be true
I know that just sayin' I'm sorry doesn't sound quite a lot
But the man you saw me with last night means no more to me
Than the thousand stars to the great clouds that cover the night
The more I look at him the more I realize how very much I love you
Shame on me for hurting you

I'll admit I shouldn't have given into love's wild temptation
With someone I cared nothing for I was blind and I hurt you
But can you ever forgive the fool the fool who really loves you
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me",Shame on Me,1969
Jan Howard,"If it's all the same to you if you don't love me like before
I don't think I'll hang around and let you hurt me anymore
If it's all the same to you if your love has really gone
Pardon me while I walk out pick up my heart and move along
I'll bet you somewhere I'll find someone I can thrill with my kiss
Mhm if it's all the same to you yes and I sadly think it is

And the world will be a better place and the world will be a better place
For you for you and me and me you just wait you just wait and see and see
Another day goes by and still the children cry put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know we won't let hatred grow put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place

Take a good look around and if you're looking down put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide on just who'll be your guide put a little love in your heart

Jan Howard,"Let's take time out to get acquainted again
We're man and wife we might as well be friends
You don't kiss me like you used to kiss me
Sometimes I take that there must be somebody new
And when I come home at night you act like you didn't even miss me
Lately honey I've even had my doubts about you
We used to face the world and life together
We used to talk of our ambitions and our dreams
But lately we've been takin' our love for granted
We have time for everything except each other it seems
Let's take time out...
[ steel ]
Let's go away and spend some time together
And see if that old spark of love's still burning bright
I want us to be close you know like we used to be
And not just two ships that pass each other in the night
Let's take time out...




",Time Out,1970
Jan Howard,"Me the girl untouchable who always kept her distance
Me the boy untouchable the wall of solid resistance
A walk a talk and one little kiss who would have thought it would lead to this
Love has touched the untouchables right in the heart
What am I gonna tell him what am I gonna say
How will I explain to her falling for you this way
Married and both untouchables
And that's what makes things worse
For love has touched the untouchables right in the heart
Right where it hurts

What am I gonna tell him...




",Untouchables,1970
Jan Howard,"Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
We were both just out on the town both of us just killing time
When almost before I knew it your lips found their way up to mine
And now here we are doing things we both know we shouldn't do
And darling I wonder just which one of us is the biggest fool of the two
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
Tomorrow we know we've got to forget this somehow
But in your arms tomorrow seems almost forever from now
But baby you've got another the same as I do
And it all just makes me stop and wonder
Which one of us is the biggest fool of the two
Who is the biggest fool of the two you for loving me or me for loving you
You for loving me or me for loving you




",Who Is the Biggest Fool,1970
Jan Howard,"When you're weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side oh when times get rough and friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down

When you're down and out when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you
I'll take your part oh when darkness comes and pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water...
[ steel ]
Sail on silver love sail on by your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine oh if you need a friend I'm sailing right behind

",Bridge over Troubled Water,1970
Jan Howard,"There's a feeling deep inside me that I've never felt before
And I feel it when I see you and when I touch you I feel it even more
And I wonder when I'm with you do you feel the way I do
When you put your arms around me do you get that feeling too
Can you feel it deep inside can you feel it in your heart
Can you feel it deep inside if you feel it then we can start

We can put our hearts together and there's none a thing to fear
If you got that lovin' feeling then the time for us is here
Can you feel it deep inside

So just take a look around you and then tell me what you see
Is the world a little brighter and does the sun seem to shine for you and me

I've killed the only one I loved because he would not take me for his bride

In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood

I wish love could be enough

Than the thought that I could be enough

Do you consider life as one
Do you believe there is a limit
To how fast a man can run

Well I don't feel that alive
No I don't feel that alive

Heading for the void
Just to catch the moment
You stole the love 
So fragile

Will you forsake me

But it may pause
The tide still falls
My time is an infinite space
Am I on pause?

Still I breathe
A new sense of freedoms in me 
As I walk forward into the light
I look it into aqua
And feeling so high
And feeling so high

Jan Lundgren,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999
Jan Lundgren,"Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Stardust gleamin' 
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion, 
You're a blue illusion 
While I'm in this Azure interlude.
I'm not wanted I'm so all alone;
Always haunted
By the dreams I own;
But, though Im tormented
I must be contented

Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet

Paradise complete

Jan Lundgren,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Jan Lundgren,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song is You,2012

That's cryin' for heat
He treats me awful
Each time we meet
It's just unlawful
How that boy can cheat
But I must have that man

He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Jan Maxwell,"In all the famous love affairs
The lovers have to struggle
In garret rooms away upstairs
The lovers starve and snuggle

They're famous for misfortune which
They seem to have no fear of
While lovers who are very rich
You very seldom hear of

No little shack do you share with me
We do not flee from a mortgagee
Nary a care in the world have we
How can love survive?

You're fond of bonds and you own a lot
I have a plane and a diesel yacht
Plenty of nothing you haven't got
How can love survive?

No rides for us on the top of a bus
In the face of the freezing breezes
You reach your goals in your comfy old rolls
Or in one of your Mercedeses

Far, very far off the beam are we
Quaint and bizarre as a team are we
Two millionaires with a dream are we
We're keeping romance alive

Two millionaires with a dream are we
We'll make our love survive

No little cold water flat have we
Warmed by the glow of insolvency
Up to your necks in security
How can love survive?

How can I show what I feel for you?
I cannot go out and steal for you
I cannot die like Camile for you
How can love survive?

You millionaires with financial affairs
Are too busy for simple pleasure
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour
For l'amour all the poor have leisure

Caught in our gold platted chains are we
Lost in our wealthy domains are we
Trapped by our capital gains are we
But we'll keep romance alive

Trapped by our capital gains are we
We'll make our love survive

Some day I'm gonna walk her home 

I'm gonna put my hands in the pocket

I can't see you with no other 
I wanna be your man and your lover 
So I can get your kisses for free 
The best girls are always hard to get 
Oh, but you're my Juliet 

But wait a minute, I've got something to say 
You just can't come into my life 
And take me away
Oh, and what am I supposed to say 
That I let go of business for some guy who wants my kisses? No way! 

I make decisions, I can walk alone 
I get suspicious, when you give me that tone 
We're not soul sisters, you're not my clone 
I'm not falling for your kisses, I can make it on my own

Home, after a year and a day
No one knows just why he was gone, if he was
Trying to make it on his own
Being fifteen years old, you get pretty cold,
When you're trying to find gold
But I guess it's best not to wait too long, and
Leave before damage is done

Well, it's harder the first time

The first thing he did was buy a pretty suit
He was trying to look good for you
He bought you dinner, and man,
He bought you drinks
And you've been forever his, ever since
And onyour way home, by the side of the road
You didn't see it coming, did you
First, you only had eyes for the young
And then, you found yourself staring at his gun

Well, it's harder the first time

The neighbour boy, he ran away, and came
Home, after a year and a day
But he didn't bother to come in, 'cause he knew

and I've still got all my pieces in place
I have to say that I'm amazed, I've been fooling
Traffic and alcohol, cigarettes and medicine
and so on
I've done it all, and I'm still going strong
But, there's no doubt about it,
this city holds a lot of thrills

But, it ain't got no substitute
for mountains and hills
And all the children always end up popping pills
And the radio keeps saying ""this city kills""

I need you to catch me when I fall
I'm driving my car through the pouring rain

Left no trace, no evidence at all
Denial is my preference
It's better if my conscience doesn't know

Run away, and stay away for quite some time
You'll find me walking on the other side
I have a completely different ticket to ride

I'm skin and bone, waiting on a train
I travel alone
Will we fall in love again? Time will show
No one knows

I'm thinking about the day,
When I'll se you in a subway hall
Will you recognize me,
And will you remember anything at all
And I know it's gonna rain that day
I pray for stormy weather

I miss you

I think it's a wonderful show you put on
And that's why I've been standing on my toes
Just to see you better than everyone else
I see you better than everyone else

You always watch me when I pack, you
Always know just where I'm at, but
I know it doesn't change the fact
That I'm gone

Gesteund door lief en leed
Wat een vriend aan mij kan geven
Is geld niet aan besteed
Je hebt vrienden waarmee je kan lachen
En waardoor je de tijd snel vergeet
Of een vriend die je pijn kan verzachten
Als je ‘t even niet meer weet

Zonder woorden
Merk je snel
Deze vriend
Begrijp me wel
Goed vertrouwen
Is het enige dat telt
Zelfs een blik zegt genoeg
Voor die hechte vriendenploeg
Er wordt gelachen
Met z'n allen in de kroeg

Jan Smit,"Vielleicht muss ich noch lernen, besser mit dem Herzen zu sehen
Vielleicht muss ich noch akzeptieren, niemand kann alles verstehen
Vielleicht mehr daran denken, dankbar zu sein für was ich habe
Vielleicht im Jetzt zum dir sein, egal was wird oder was war
Und dann schließe ich meine Augen, und es fühlt sich gut dann wie es ist
Und das eine was du tun kannst, ist bleiben wie du bist
Glaube an Schicksal oder glaube an dich, was immer es auch ist
Alles was du tun kannst, ist bleiben wie du bist
Glaube an die Liebe oder lauf davon, was immer es auch ist
Alles was du tun kannst, ist bleiben wie du bist

Wir allen machen Fehler, van denen wir so manche bereihen
Wir stellen uns in die Reihe, obwohl wir von der Freiheit träumen
Wie du will ich so vieles und wir allen suchen unseren Weg
Und jede Prüfung wird leichter wenn mann zu sich selber steht

Und das eine was du tun kannst, ist bleiben wie du bist
Glaube an Schicksal oder glaube an dich, was immer es auch ist
Alles was du tun kannst, ist bleiben wie du bist

singing 'Cathy's Clown'
That's the man that she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed, so she is I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead China doll
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
Now she's done and there calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
'Cos I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is the revenge to the tune
""you're no good,
You're no good you're no good you're no good""
Can't you tell that it's well understood
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow

I'm tired
I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
still going strong

It's ok, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell mr. man with impossible plans to just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes

I want the Prodigy really loud
I want it all right now

Go home never know never be real

And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""",Nice Work If You Can Get It,2004
Jan Tober,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [Stereo],2009

How time flies
When compassion dies
No stocking, no candy canes
No gingerbread, no safety net

No loose change, no change, no
Santa Claus is coming
'Cause Santa Claus ain't coming
No room at the Holiday Inn again
Well, maybe next year or when

December twenty-fourth, ten p.m.
Eastern standard time
I can't believe a year went by so fast
Time to see, what we have time to see

Turn the projector on first shot roger
With the fender guitar he just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back

I found my song
He found his song
If he could just find Mimi
I tried you know I tried

Fade in on mark
Who's still in the dark
But he's got great footage
Which he's cut together

To screen tonight
In honor of Benny's wife
Muffy, Alison
Pulling Benny out of the east village location

Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight
I wonder how Alison found out about Mimi?
Maybe a bird told her or an angel
I had a little hunch you could use, a little 'flow

Tutoring again? Negative
Back at you? No, no you, no
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium
To provide an honorarium to anyone with the code

With a private corner banquette in the back
We'll make it yet, we'll somehow get to Santa Fe

But you'd miss New York before you could unpack
Mark, Roger, anyone? Help
Maureen?
It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs

No, she was huddled in the park in the dark
And she was freezing and begged to come here
Over here, oh, god
Got a light, I know you, you're shivering

She's been living on the street
We need some heat
I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat

I'm afraid she needs more than heat
I heard that
Collins will call for a doctor, honey
Don't waste your money on mimi, me, me

Hello-911? I'm on hold
Cold, cold, would you light my candle
Yes, we'll, oh God, find a candle

I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you

I should tell you

Shh, I know
I should tell you why I left
It wasn't, 'cause I didn't

I know, I should tell you
I should tell you

Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me 

But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so 
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me

As far back as I remember, the game's been played
Boy chase girl and girl dissed the boy.
But there's only one exception to the rule
and that is loot and a whole big bag of it.
Now, I'm speaking from experience,
and when you're broke you know you get no skiniens.
And if you lucky like Luciano, now here's my motto,
Lay it one by one and make sure it's legato.
Straight up macin' in a rental, now see me smile.
My clothes are all from marshalls and I got my game tight.
And prayin' that the gold stays on my ring
and if not I'll spray that shit on, again.
It's all good, I learned how to roll with the punches
in order for me to get a little somethin'-somethin'.
It wasn't the bomb, but, Yo, I ain't complainin'.
I thank the lord and so I cherish it, oh.

[Chorus]
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.
Cherish the love we have for as long as we both shall live.

Oh, aha, yeah.

Nucky for this Biggie Bear Body
the game's alright, but this fellow get no kind of money.
So funny, cause I is broke as a joke,
But still I maintain to hold my own.
Selective, and checkin' my prospective, active,
and you all disreactin', negative,
'cause all I speak is the truth, all I need is a roof
and the rest is all good.
I've played the Mac, but so does everybody else.
I'm blessed with my family and my friends.
A chosen few in my life that I cherish.
And you other ""player-haters"" better just vanish.
I often pray before I lay down by your side.
If you received your calling before i awake.
could I make it trough the might.
I'm telling you, man.

Learned how to say sorry and how to say thanks.

I am ready to go
I lost control
I am ready to fly
I touch the sky
I am ready to fly... (2x)

Everytime when it seems like the end
Then I think of you and I'm happy again
Yes, and everywhere I lay in my head
I will dream of you and I'm no longer sad.

It's the morning of loneliness
It's the morning of emptiness
But I'm reaching up for the lie of pain
Reaching up, I'm running away!

I am ready to fly
I feel so high
I am ready to go
I lost control
I am ready to fly
I touch the sky
I am ready to fly... (2x)

In the morning I open my eyes
I'm lost in love and I wonder why
Will I ever happen to see you again
Will you ever come back to me in the end
",Ready to Fly,2006

Jan Werner,"When I was young
I never needed anyone
And makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be, all by myself anymore

You were soaking wet
No time to be impressed
I remember so much later on

I knew that you were someone
I would not forget
Everybody's searching, hungry for the glamour
You know too many hearts are in a rush

No matter how you try to
You can't explain
The places you find love
I can't explain it, but I can feel it

All around me
The need to find the place
Where feeling can be safe
It's not money that buys happiness

No, it's not the shine of silver that puts the heart to rest
Everybody's pushing
The clock is always running and
No one ever seems to have enough

And when you least expect it
You come upon the places you find love-love-love
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you

Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart, yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars, oh yeah

It's a river never stopping
Winding in and out
But you should never doubt
It will lead you

To the ocean someday
There's no way to fight it
Let it carry you away
Everybody's dreaming waiting for the feeling

That moment when they finally rise above
But it's always in the giving
That gets you to the places you find love-love
Remember in the poorest part of town

Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
The feeling stays alive-yeah, yeah
Little children laughing and playing

'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up-no,
'Cause they still believe in love, sweet love

Though their sad power may prevail, 
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart

Long before nations' lines were drawn 
When no flags flew, and no armies stood 
My land was born 
And you ask me why I love her 
Through wars, death and despair 
She is the constant 
We who don't care 
And you ask me would I leave her -- but how? 
I cross over borders but I'm still there now 
How can I leave her?

The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister

And she cried when she looked in the eye of the people she met
There was no blood there was no secret power
When she counted the cost of all she'd lost
From her ivory tower

She said, ""I have courage and I have grace
A kind of wisdom and a certain faith
But it's all I can manage
To keep this place of mine
Alive, alive

She kept all the tears she wept in a small container
So when they asked for proof of what she called her truth she said,
""It couldn't be plainer"". She told them, ""You give me this name

But there's a chance I'll bleed or dare to need
A thread of life to cling to"".

Funny, thought you needed your space just five nights ago
I bet you'll take her to our favorite spot,
Blanket down, on the ground, and chicken from momma's stove,
And when you pull her in close

Maybe a little bit of lightning too
And I hope it comes a flood, lots of mud,
Messin' up your whole day
Hey hey, and I hope it rains

Don't get me wrong, I hope she's really the one
And if it's love you know I wish you the best
You'll probably have yourself an outside wedding,
With violins, all our friends, and her in her pretty white dress
And right before that first kiss

Maybe a little bit of lightning too
And I hope it comes a flood, lots of mud,

Hope it pours,
I hope she's in heels, and some little white shorts

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

To blame for this catastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
Is as plain as it can be

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Since they say my baby left the door 
With your key all broken 
And your face a-flutter 
With your spare ribs groaning 
And you're panic-stricken 
What's that you're wearing? 
I feel you in my soul 
Since the day I turned around 
Day I turned around [2x] 
With your fingers missing 
And your paper dreams",Angel,1991

The music's in its chamber

The weight is on your shoulders 
The past is at your heel 
Guess the plight is in your fancy

The rest is how you feel 
We're not gonna take it out to the farm, lest you leave

As the moon goes out this evenin'

Led you to his [unknown]

Jane,"She found she was walking on the ground of a one way street
And she cried when she looked in the eye of the people she met
There was no blood there was no secret power
When she counted the cost of all she'd lost
From her ivory tower

She said, ""I have courage and I have grace
A kind of wisdom and a certain faith
But it's all I can manage
To keep this place of mine
Alive, alive

She kept all the tears she wept in a small container
So when they asked for proof of what she called her truth she said,
""It couldn't be plainer"". She told them, ""You give me this name
I carry your pain , I do your dying for you
But there's a chance I'll bleed or dare to need
A thread of life to cling to"".

That I dare not speak the name

For fear that they could fall and fade into the air
Who cares?

Guide my way
Be my star on a stormy day
Light my way
Be my star on a stormy , stormy day

I've not seen this one before

Can overflow
Surprise you so
And people can be broken
And I would too

Should break somebody else's heart

These days
Stay on my mind
These ways
Are only mine
And we'll say it's just to pass the time away
It's just a lonely day (repeat)

And as your castle crumples down
You will recall the stony walls and how they held
Your secret crown
And in the silence of the dream
The face of shame which has no name
Is all I call
To comfort me

Crossfire of dreams and demons
Leaves me to explain
There is only ever reason
There can only be

Jane,"I've been to many places
I keep seeing the same old faces
Don't know how much is true
'cause I lose myself when I think of
You
You
I walked around the edge
And I grew some roots in the talking heads
The words they say ring true
But I lose myself when I think of
You
You

We Are One (repeat)

Surrender to the power
That makes every moment lead to now
I guess that I've been through
A few illusions to get to
You
You

We Are One (repeat)

Where I am
I grow weary of the storm that leads me to
Wherever I think I am
Whenever I find
A different point of view
Grains of sand may throw me
Voices in the distance call my name
Memories beckon me
Back to where I once became
You
You

We Are One (repeat)

A little more than I should
We both know I got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
This is must realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I love you
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So, I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

Me dégoulinent dans le dos 
Nous pataugeons dans la gadoue 

Vivons un peu sous le ciel gris-bleu 
D'amour et d'eau de pluie 
Et puis mettons en marche les essuie-glaces 
Et rentrons à Paris 

Ça nous changera pas d'ici 
Nous garderons nos parapluies 
Et nous retrouverons la gadoue 

Il fait un temps abominables 
Heureusement tu as ton imperméable 
Et ça n'empêche pas la gadoue 

Il fallait venir jusqu'ici 
Pour jouer les amoureux transis 
Et patauger dans la gadoue 

Vivons un peu sous le ciel gris-bleu 
D'amour et d'eau de pluie 
Et puis mettons en marche les essuie-glaces 
Et rentrons à Paris 

L'année prochaine nous irons 
Dans un pays où il fait bon 
Et nous oublierons la gadoue",La gadoue,1996

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1998

Elle a ouvert le gaz et s’allonge sur son lit
Sur le pickup elle a mis son sondis favoris
Déjà elle n’a plus toute sa raison
Ell’ voit d’étranges fleurs, des fleurs bizarr’s

In every dream home a heartache
And every step I take
Takes me further from heaven
Is there a heaven?
I'd like to think so
Standards of living
They're rising daily
But home oh sweet home
It's only a saying
From bell push to faucet
In smart town apartment
The cottage is pretty
The main house a palace
Penthouse perfection
But what goes on
What to do there
Better pray there

Open plan living
Bungalow ranch style
All of its comforts
Seem so essential
I bought you mail order
My plain wrapper baby
Your skin is like vinyl
The perfect companion
You float my new pool
De luxe and delightful
Inflatable doll
My role is to serve you
Disposable darling
Can't throw you away now
Immortal and life size
My breath is inside you
I'll dress you up daily
And keep you till death sighs
Inflatable doll
Lover ungrateful
I blew up your body
But you blew my mind

Oh Those Heartaches

Jane Birkin,"The little thoughts came rushing in
Was I watched for a sign from him
When all the while was clear as day
That I should go and he should stay

I took his love like it was mine
I squeezed the truth until it lied
It took some time for cracks to show
Should I stay or should he go?

The simple story that you told me
Is a little different from what you showed me
The simple story, unfurling slowly
Is if you lay down with a dream you'll wake up lonely

The fog will cast a certain shade
So what you see is how what's made
It's mark will show you what to do
When hope pretends it's made you new

Love lied
Love lied
But I'm the reason
Love died

The simple story that you told me
Is a little different than what you showed me

The sky wraps round the mountaintops
The watch unwinds until it stops
Some things will always be the way they are
And that is how they'll stay

On se crie dessus, on se griffe la figure.
On se regarde toujours si durement.

Dis-moi que tu les abandonnes,
Ces baisers, ces tourments
Donnés par les autres personnes,
Avant.
J'en ai des mots d'amour qui sonnent,
Mais maladivement
Cachés, comme chez les autres hommes,
Dedans.

On s'aime et le vie veut qu'on joue
Des rôles qui nous coulent sur les joues.
Comme deux capricieux, capricieusement
Jaloux de la pluie qui touche tes cheveux,
Jalouse des choses que voient tes yeux,
On se regarde toujours jalousement.

Dis-moi que tu les abandonnes,
Ces baisers, ces tourments
Donnés par les autres personnes,

Trying to heel toe on my Jane Bond tactics
Y'all steady hating on this, crush me want to bet

Spark it like streetlights at sunset
Throw fear in your hearts like bomb threats
Got you shook up like dourest twitching
Should of never started bitching

Got me pinching bricks of chicks, that stay in the forest
Who be evergreen with envy once found out her flow be flawless
Knocking mine, all I'm trying to do is live and shine
Illuminate the laws of cipher when I ignite rhymes

Your days are numbers, I stunt ya growth flip you into lumber
Jane Bond the double 0 deadly with the magic number
7 like the days of your weak ass flow

So thick that when you flap you jibs, I continue to rip

Like you ain't want it, not bold come out from behind me
What's all of that, yo scandalous snake cats
True my back, then end results you fake jacks

Matter fact I snatch you off throne you think you own
Smash you light tenderizes to the sirloin, this held cap
Smack you with her tongue before she smack you wit her pause
Yours outta stores my lyrics could tour

Before I pass you the rope you hung yourself
Sad mistake like Pandora's box, it's too late
Cursed you, now all that's left at the bottom is hope
You done fucked up, big time, that's all she wrote
Yeah

Now it's no more chance in hell
Will I surrender corral holes that fell
You a pretender, suited up mc fronting lets take it to the ring tonight
I leave you frozen like deer's staring at headlights

You easily broken like fine china
Wimpy like glad bags, I spit words like geysers
You waving the white flag, you mad?
Oh my bad, ain't know Jane Bond was gone do you like that

Make my mark leave skid marks like dirty farts
Whip the shit from the hole in your face when you talk
Dar she blows, sizing foes, seismic molds
The worlds shook, be the end result of powerful flows

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

Gas plays like petroleum, walk over them like linoleum
My vocab expand like a rubber band
Walkin' naked through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman
Niggas just don't understand my reasons, I transcend like season
And scar these rappers like Legion
It's treason, my suspension attract attention
I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention
Did I mention my name, yo, go by the Jane Doe
Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho
You don't know, this is just half my potential
Check my credentials, come harder than sequential
It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian
They bless me on the track cuz I attack wit' the estrogen
Rhyme against the best a men, Jane burn it up

So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks
Rain of acid drops, seek some help
Now don't rewind, get it the first time
Shouldn't have to repeat myself
Eternally verbally, I have numbers, succumb to time outs
In rhyme bouts you'll dial 9, just to get a line out
Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured
Results in more cast appearances than a hundred actors
Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils
Wordsworth, Kweli, Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal what

My style highlights like fonts when I burn heads like a conk
Cause niggas front, when their chances get slim like Pharoahe Monch
Thinkin' they shits is heavy when they light like illumination
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations
My fascination with character assassination
Got these niggas burnin' like sensation
We keep it hot like matches and on lock like latches
Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches
So YOU GO! To every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram)
My lyrics they get up in your jeans like Parasucos
So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered
Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars
And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken
Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans
Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams
See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean
Like a squeegee, we be lightin' shit up like phosphorus
Turnin' flamboyant niggas anonymous, depressin' to optimist
You stoppin' us is preposterous, like an androgynous misogynist
You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus
Transformin', from rookie of the year to veteran
Hip-hop is big business like Con Edison or medicine
But fuck it, they gonna let us in, or else we rush the door
I got too many reasons, save your 'whys' and 'what fors'

This is twice inna lifetime so I'm lettin' you know (let 'em know yo!)
Blackstar, Wordsworth, Punchline and Jane Doe (yo!)
Lyrical com-pete and WE emcee
We got the fortified five, exhibit level degree

Check it
I keep dough in my pocket while you follow the false prophet
Get deep like Islamics wrapped in a white garment
I touch topics that try to open up your optics
Vacate in the Tropics, you dodgin' bullets in the projects
Cut the nonsense, I'm hotter than a lot of men
Start honorin', got more wifeys than Solomon
Fuck the squad you in, a-yo we be the biddomb
Regardless what I spit on, you worse with the tracks I shit on
Once you get on, it's fair you can't trust (Yes!)
Words & Punch, make rappers march like the third month
I build with friends, lyrically spit gems
Call me diamond, cuz I'm your girl's best friend
Emcees are born losers, alcoholic abusers
I'll go on the radio and start a gay rumor
And then I'll talk about how the crowd tried to boo ya
Label shoot ya, stressed out with brain tumors
My gat claps, 50% of the wack
Take it back to real rap, Krylons wit' the fat cap
Get robbed for your ASCAP, leave you inside
Fortified live, reppin' NY 'til I die!

Black body radiation situation that we workin' wit'
My verb exists enlisted by the bogeys campin' services
The purpose is, make you go and purchase this, no nervousness
We are, hot like black tar, Black Star with emergence
Superlative, you fabricated like the word absurditive
I'm rockin' this from here to where the Persians live
To Brooklyn where the merchants live
Next door to the murderers
And bourbon is a elder man's medicinal alternative
My memory is furnished with, back streets to back seats to fat Jeeps
Legendary athletes who play by the trash heap
My crew wasn't that deep, but beef we didn't act sweet
Treadin' on these stompin' grounds you better catch some black feet
Flashy, it was between DeKalb and Pulasky
Off the meter like an out of borough taxi
They run your pockets fastly, black and nasty, nappy and crafty
That's why they're either sittin' in Clinton or Coxsackie
Mayor Rudolph can screw off! You too soft to stop us
You and your coppers should see some foot doctors
Got your bird chest popped up, but keep your guns cocked up
Cuz all them cats that you knocked up ain't always gon' be locked up
Hot stuff like Donna Summer, another number one-r
And comin' from the underground, this is how it's comin' down
Baby let me run it down
Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Jane Doe, Punch, Wor..[ahem] umm..E!
Excuse me! Just ate another emcee!
Sometimes that's just how it be
Partner wash you down with green tea and some lime
We like the five on the fist, fortified organized like DIS!",Twice Inna Lifetime,1998
Jane Drake,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars

Jane Drake,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,2005
Jane Duboc,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,1996

I must the true Relation make, 
I am undone to Night; 
Love in a subtile Dreame disguis'd, 
Hath both my heart and me surpriz'd, 
Whom never yet he durst attempt t' awake; 
Nor will he tell me for whose sake
He did me the Delight,

Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family get down!
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
To take time out, and show you what life's about

Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale

Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I'll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you

That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you

Jane Froman,"Ev'ning marks the close of day,
Skies of blue begin to grey,
Crimson hues are fading in the West;
Ev'ning ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be,
Memories of those I love the best.
 
When shadows fall 
And trees whisper day is ending,
My thoughts are ever wending Home.
When the crickets call,
My heart is forever yearning,
Once more to be returning Home.
When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a peeping one by one.
Night covers all 
And, though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me Home.

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

You didn't need me.

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret

Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

You weakened my resistance, and colored my existence

I get purple with anger, at the things you do
And I'm green with envy, when you meet a dame

I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)
Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day

Okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up
Yeah. Like it.
Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Yeah! That's nice
Yeah!

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay

Jane McDonald,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours

Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore

Now it's April

Now that's all in the past

A season of song
For love's sweet promise

Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit

I never go to show at night, but just to matiness now
I see the show and home I go

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

Once you told me that I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

And now I even have to scratch my back myself

I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again

Won't you turn that new leaf over,

Jane Monheit,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said,
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men.",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,2005

I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm a grown up now and still need help somehow?
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my life long wish, my grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need

No more lives torn apart and wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts, and everyone would have a friend
And right would always win and love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list

As children we believed the grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath our tree
Well Heaven surely knows that packages and bows
Can never heal a hurting human soul

Oh no more lives torn apart and wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts, and everyone would have a friend
And right would always win and love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list

Why is this illusion called the innocence of youth?
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart and wars would never start
And time would heal our hearts, everyone would have a friend
And right would always win and love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list, this is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2000

Who lost his love through his indifference

No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.

I had no complaints,

Jane Powell,"It's a most unusual day
Feel like throwing my worries away
As an old native-born Californian would say
It's a most unusual day

There's a most unusual sky
Not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring
It's a most unusual day

There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of Spring in the air

It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual, most unusual, most unusual day

Los polluelos, los polluelos con su pio (4x) pi

Chorus

(you know, I think you can sing this with us...)

In colors, in colors the Fields bloom in spring
In colors, in colors the little birds fly from afar
In colors, in colors the rainbow arcs so clearly
And for this reason, these great loves of many colors, please be so

De colores, de colores se visten los campos en la primavera
De colores de colores son los pajaritos que vienen de afuera
De colores, de colores es el arco iris que vemos lucir

Chorus (4x)



",De Colores,1986
Jane Sapp,"When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys.
Everybody said I only did it to annoy
But I was gonna be an engineer.

Mamma said, ""Why can't you be a lady?
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl
Wait until you're older, dear
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl.

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow,
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk
Learn to coo, learn to moo
That's what you do to be a lady, now.

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read
History, geography and home economy
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need
To while away the extra time until the time to breed
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?
I says, ""I'm gonna be an engineer!""

""No, you only need to learn to be a lady
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world
An engineer could never have a baby
Remember, dear, that you're a girl""

She's smart, for a woman.
I wonder how she got that way?
You get no choice, you get no voice
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb.
That's how you come to be a lady, today.

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly
Working out the day and night so I could qualify
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh
Said, ""I've never had an engineer!""
""You owe it to the job to be a lady
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl""

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation
We were busy every night with loving recreation
I spent my days at work so he could get an education
And now he's an engineer!

He said: ""I know you'll always be a lady
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life
Could an engineer look after or obey me?
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!""

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them
""Your mother was an engineer!""
""You owe it to the kids to be a lady
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby
Remember you're a mother now!""

Every time I turn around there's something else to do
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two
Listening to Jimmy Young, it makes me want to spew
I was gonna be an engineer.

I only wish that I could be a lady
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's supposed to do
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me
Then I could be a person too.

What price for a woman?
You can buy her for a ring of gold,
To love and obey, without any pay,
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold.

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back.
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says ""We pay you as a lady,
You only got the job because I can't afford a man,
With you I keep the profits high as may be,
You're just a cheaper pair of hands.""

You got one fault, you're a woman
You're not worth the equal pay.
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart,
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain,

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool
And an underpaid engineer
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady
I'll fight them as an engineer!",I'm Gonna Be an Engineer,1986
Jane Sapp,"I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,
Alive as you and me.
Says I ""But Joe, you're ten years dead""
""I never died"" said he,
""I never died"" said he.

""The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,
They shot you Joe"" says I.
""Takes more than guns to kill a man""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""

""In Salt Lake City, Joe,"" says I, 
Him standing by my bed, 
""They framed you on a murder charge,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead."" 

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes.
Says Joe ""What they can never kill
Went on to organize,
Went on to organize""

From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine and mill,
Where working men defend their rights,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill!

I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,
Alive as you and me.
Says I ""But Joe, you're ten years dead""
""I never died"" said he,
""I never died"" said he.",Joe Hill,1986
Jane Sapp,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord, Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord, Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord, Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""
Well, every Monday morning
When the bluebirds begin to sing.
You can hear John Henry a mile or more.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.
Lord, Lord.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.",John Henry,1986
Jane Sapp,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1986
Jane Sapp,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

Jane Scheckter,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1988
Jane Scheckter,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near

So lock the doors and call me yours

Jane Scheckter,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
