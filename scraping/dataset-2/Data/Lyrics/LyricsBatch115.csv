David Bowie,"Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumor from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the action man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following""

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Want to come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom

David Bowie,"Oh, oh, oh, little China girl
Oh, oh, oh, little China girl

I could escape this feeling, with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men's who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says, sh-sh-shhh
She says, sh-sh-shhh
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited

David Bowie,"There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
That people from bad homes
Do again and again

It's big and it's bland
Full of tension and fear
They do it over there
But we don't do it here

Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right

We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town

Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me, no

There's a brand new talk
But it's not very clear
That people from good homes
Are talking this year
Fashion

It's loud and tasteless
And I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing
On the ole dance floor

And she can't socialise

And I'll love her till the day she dies

Skin heads getting to school
Beating on blacks with a baseball bat
Racism back in rule

White trash picking up Nazi flags
While you was gone, there was war
This is the west, get used to it
They put a Swastika over the door

Under the God, under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God, under the God
Ten steps into the crazy, crazy

Washington heads in the toilet bowl
Don't see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate

Toxic jungle of Uzi trails
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
Well, you're dead, you just ain't buried yet

Under the God, under the God
Under the God, under the God

As the walls came tumbling down
So, the secrets that we shared
I believed you by the palace gates
Now the savage days are here

Under the God

Under the God, under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God, under the God
One steps into the crazy, crazy

Crazy eyed man with a shot gun
Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cut with a knife

Under the God, under the God

Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

The woman I loved is dead

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy

They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea

A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise, was he

And then one day
One magic day, he passed my way

You'll ever learn
Is just to love
And be loved

David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think
You knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there

Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

Now she walks through her sunken dream

And she's hooked to the silver screen

That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

It's about to be writ again

Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand

News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TV's
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there

And all the fat, skinny people, and all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
Never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And the queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice cream parlor
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

But very wise, was he

Is just to love, and be loved in return",Nature Boy [From Moulin Rouge!],2005

he looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
his father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg

He's got 9 brothers and sisters
they're brought up on their knees
it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
he's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard

This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
you can believe it man it's true
somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard

Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
that's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard

Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
going out

Outside it's a bright night
there's an opera at Lincoln Center
movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
but the lights are out on the Mean Streets

A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
he's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""

And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard

Misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song

They are the stars, they're dying for you

Trap you with their beautiful eyes

David Bowie,"No one ever saw you 
Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper 
Somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms
Then vile rewards for you

And I'm gonna tell, yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you've said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

Some night on a thriller street
Will come a silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
They'll come such assassin's needle 
On a crowded train
I bet you feel so lonely you could die

Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly 
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that

I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh, please, please make it soon

Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues, my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end

Hopefully it'll shine on you
Death alone shall love you

She was born in a UFO

I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in an a-line skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The 50's movie, so many squealed
There’s no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought, my life could start

With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see by their eyes that they’re bitching sore
I’d rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage, geometric face
Electric skin, plastic and lace
Silver hair, trapezoid flanks
I was so in love with her lavender vest

I’m gonna say goodbye he says yea
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye yea

The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can’t get enough of that doomsday song
They can’t get enough of it all

Listen

Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river‘s bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest

First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with satan while they dress like the saints
They know god exists for the devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

Hippie to the hippie,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it

To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat,
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello,
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown,

And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank, sing that song!

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,
And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why
You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,

Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,

Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

I'll put TNT in your behind  I said

A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old

But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast

Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

The me that you know he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore
The me that you know doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore
All pain disappears it's the nature of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear there's no escape from this my new consciousness
That me that you know used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you I'm so far away
I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all my bad parts
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear

Upon my liars chair,
Full of broken thoughts,
I cannot repair,

Beneath the stains of time,
The feelings disappear,
You are someone else,
I am still right here,

The screams of night, the end of love

One open wound, wasted and drowned

David Bowie,"A nation stands with heart in hand
To sing their anthem proudly
Voices raised to sing their praise
Of their hollow country
All this talk of freedom
And some talk of liberty
From your plastic podium
You try and convince me

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Your freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

I can't see red, white, and blue waving in the air
I don't hear the bombs bursting and I don't even care
I'm sorry for my lack of faith
I'm not the greatest patriot
If this is all their is to freedom I don't want it

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Your freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

Pushing us a drug that you call freedom and democracy
Promise us that selfishness is the means for happiness
I burned that bridge so long ago that I can hardly see
Anything but solace in what freedom means to me

I can't fall anymore
For some silver-tongued song
Freedom isn't free
So let me say what freedom means to

It cannot mean to serve ourselves
That doesn't mean a thing
It doesn't mean to give the license
To seek ourselves in anything
That would be slavery to ourselves it isn't free
Jesus Christ, the only thing that freedom means to me.",Up the Hill Backwards [Live],1997

Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Ha ha, yeah

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it up and make it nice
Pop goes the weasel

You know, pop goes the weasel
For years, I've wondered
What that meant
And nobody seemed to know

So, I looked it up
And the official explanation
Goes something like this

Pop goes the weasel refers to
The habit of London hatters long ago
Popping or pawning their weasels
Or accessories on Saturday night
To buy liquor, isn't that interesting

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

But you know
I've got a theory of my own
About pop goes the weasel
It's much simpler

Why did the weasel go pop, go pop
Pop, pop goes the weasel
Why did the weasel go pop
'Cause they upped the price
Of tuppeny rice to four pence

How did the pop get into the weasel
Weasel, pop goes the weasel
How did the pop get in there
Well, the weasel caught his
Beakle in the treacle

Now, if you've got a weasel
And you don't want him to pop
The next time you go shopping
Don't you take him in the shop
Two, three, four

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now that is the way
That the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's sitting on the table
Now I take a stick
And I knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Together now

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now, I mix it up
And I make it nice
Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel

Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive

And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John
(Big John, big John)

They just placed a marble stand in front of it

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord,1999
David Briggs,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999
David Briggs,"The General just gave me a medal oh I'm a sight for mom to see
But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And men who've died for men on earth will get their heavenly dues
And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill
When I hang this medal around the neck of Oklahoma Bill",Oklahoma Bill,1999
David Briggs,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,

You know threes many a man with his life out of tune,
Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

Things happen sometimes that are nice

Stood in the shadows of my dreams

But I never knew how much emptiness
One lonely heart could hold

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",A Ghost of a Chance,2002

Manacled, beaten by Your own people
Do You have the first idea

Why You deserve it?
Listen, King of the Jews

Look at me, am I a Jew?

I have got no kingdom in this world

Why do you not speak
When I have your life in my hands?
How can You stay quiet?

You have nothing in Your hands
Any power You have
Comes to You from far beyond
Everything is fixed and You can't change it

You're a fool, Jesus Christ

You have a duty to keep the peace

Well, I'm dressed up so nice
An' I'm doin' my best
Yes I'm startin' over
Startin' over in another place

Lemme tell you a story
Big chief with a golden crown
He's got rings on his fingers
And then he walks up, up to the throne

He's makin' shapes with his hands
An' don't you dare sit down
Now don't you dare sit back
And don't you dare speak up!

[Chorus]
And on the first day, we had everything we could 
hold
Oh and then we let it fall
And on the second day, there was nothing else left 
to do
Oh what a day that was.

There are 50,000 beggars
Roaming in the streets
They have lost all their possessions
They have nothing left to eat

Down come the bolts of lightning
Now an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction
Go pull a fire alarm

I'm dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
And I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions

[Chorus]

Oh a day that was
Oh that's the way it goes
There's a million ways, to get things done
Three's a million ways, to make things work out.

Well I'm going right through
And the light came down
Well they're roundin' 'em up
from all over town

They're movin' forward and back
They're movin' backwards and front
And they're enjoying themselves
Moving in every direction

So if you feel like you`re in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
And if you feel like talking to someone
Who knows the difference between right and wrong

We're goin' boom boom boom 
That's the way we live
And in a great big room and 
That's the way we live.",What a Day That Was,1981

David Byrne,"I thought that if I ate the food of the area I was visiting.
That I might assimilate the point of view of the people there.
As if the point of view was somehow in the food.
So I would make no choices myself regarding what food I ate.

I would simply follow the examples of those around me.
I would study menus very carefully,
Making note of important differences and similarities.
When shopping at the supermarket

I felt a great desire to walk off with someone else's groceries
So that I could study them at length
And study their effects on me.
As though if I ate their groceries I would become that person; until I finished their groceries.

And we might find ourselves going to the same places.
Running into one another at the movies
Or in a shopping mall.
Reading the same books.

Watching the same TV programmes.
Wearing the same clothes.
Travelling to the same places.
And taking the same pictures.

Getting sick at the same time.
And getting well again simultaneously.
Finding ourselves attracted to the same people.
Working at the same job.

And making the same amount of money.
Living identical lives - as long as the groceries lasted.",Social Studies,1985

Their business was in another town
Bigger than the town they were driving from.
Business took place during office hours in both towns.
This drive was considered business
The feeling of passing other cars was also considered business
A feeling of business being done.
The feeling of drifting slowly through a field of moving vehicles.
This was the REAL speed - the speed of business.
Not the numbers on the speedometer.
One of them was playing with the radio
Slowly changing the channel from one station to another
Sometimes listening to both channels at once.
On one channel a man was talking to another man on the telephone.

She thinks that she must wear the right clothes.
The right combination of clothes - will make her lucky.
But there are specific kinds of luck - and different kinds are are needed - for different occasions:

'A blue dress for intuition'
'The grey shirt and maroon slacks - for making strong statements'
'The navy pullover - and her woolen skirt - for discovering mystery'

She thinks of what she wore - on a similar occasion - like the one she will be involved in today.
Particularly a similar occasion - that was successful for her.
She lies on the bed - and imagines herself in a variety of outfits.
She quickly narrows - the range of possibilities.

David Byrne,"I am nothing like my sister
I am nothing like my mom
You can't see me in my father
Wonder where did I come from

And the laws of men are not the laws of heaven
And angel's breath is like the desert wind
And terrorists are acting out of love sweet love
To bring us home again

It's sin to seek perfection
It's a sin to help the poor
It's a sin to hold convictions
For none of them are true

And the laws of men are not the laws of heaven
And angel's breath is like the desert wind
And terrorists are acting out of love sweet love

And the passion in their eyes
For none of them can open

David Byrne,"The words of love
Are not enough
Though sweet as wine
As thick as blood
Passionless moments
And we are homeless
Out on the street

But life is cool
And things aren't bad
Got what he wants
Lost what he had
He soon adjusted
And got accustomed
To these new ways

Blame God, how can you lose?
Singing such sweet Rhythm and Blues
Strange days, she said to me
Being in love ? don't mean you're free

But night reveals
What daytime hides
Who lingers on
Who sleeps outside
A soft seduction
A strong attraction
Somewhere downtown

A dancer's knees
The laws of chance
Strange as it seems
Take us exactly
Where we most likely
Need to be",A Soft Seduction,1997
David Byrne,"She put the scar on the side of his face
When he disappeared for three days
And they say that they are in love
He took her cocaine when she was asleep
And friends say he gave half away
And they say that they are in love

Run away, run away
Run away before it's too late
There is danger but they will not see
If they're blind, then it's blind that they'd rather be.

This town's destroyed more than one friend of mine
Funny that they never leave
They say that they are in love
Some say it's rotten, some say it's wrong
Some say it's hard to believe
And some say that they are in love

Move away, move away
Move away before it's too late
And the lion sleeps with the lamb
Only love lets me forget who I really am

This land is small and it's cold and it's damp
But there's no place that I'd rather be
I know that I am in love
Ethnic divisions, screaming demands
A little bit like you and me
I guess that we are in love

Stay away, stay away
Stay away you might end up like me
It's the pain that keeps us alive
But that beauty is all that we need to survive
That damn beauty is all that we need to survive",They Are in Love,1997

Full of freedom, full of nonsense
From the mountains to the beaches
Eat the apples, steal the peaches
Will you be this wild child's lady?
Will you carry me to safety?

& the genes that I inherit
Blame it on my older sister for showing me her dirty pictures
Blame the TV & the movies
Blame the lawyers & the juries

Smoke and hands up women's blouses

The waiter looks me over
Would you like cream or sugar?
I don't know, what was I supposed to say 

She wonders if I'll notice
I should have brought some roses
Her plate is full, she hasn't eaten all day 

Glasses collect we order some booze
She looks at me, I stare at her shoes
Mature situations, maybe a broken heart 

Maybe I ought to pay the bill
Maybe she thinks I never will
A million things that cross a woman's mind 

Just be yourself, well that's what they say
I barely know who I was yesterday
I'm gonna be that civilized guy someday

The rise and fall of nations
A moments glory and they've had their day

Like starin' at the ceiling
My sleepy eyes, you smell so nice

Got no idea, what time it is
Delightfully confusing

Arrives, like pirates on parade

Surprise, it's pirates on parade
A ray of light, between the blinds
I lie there in a stupor
I hear a thud, and then a flush

Guess it must be the neighbors
I blink my eyes, I laugh inside
Imagine what they're saying
I see your shape and through the night

Here come, those pirates on parade
Ahoy, it's pirates on parade
Through the rough and stormy weather
On a search for buried treasure

There's an island to explore
Every wave that whispers softly
""Stay in bed, 'cause it's still early""
Dolphins frolic by the shore

And the phone never rings when the pirates are singing
Well there's 16 men on a dead man's chest
In this hallucination
The map we got, x marks the spot

We're following directions
The 7 seas, the balmy breeze
The pleasure of surrender
The end is nigh, the sun is high

It's late, for pirates on parade
Too late, for pirates on parade
Traffic noises down below me
A helicopter circles slowly

Monsters sink into the deep
Mountainous and downy billows
Float among those fluffy pillows
Maybe I'll go back to sleep

And the phone never rings when the pirates are singing
This wicked life
So what's in store behind that velvet curtain?

And the day is here

David Byrne,"I ride on a perfect freeway
Many people on that road
I heard the sound of someone laughing
I saw my neighbor's car explode

Just up ahead
Against the sky
Quicker than you blink your eye

Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
And among the living, we are giving, all through the night

From the milk of human kindness
From the breast we all partake
Hungry for a social contract
She welcomes you with dark embrace

(Puts) socks and shoes
Upon our feet
Little fishes swim upstream

Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
In the deepest silence, gold and diamonds, all through the night

It's just an old photograph, there's nothing to hide
When the world was just beginning

I memorized her face so it's not forgotten
I hear the wind whistle in, come back anytime
And we'll mix our lives together
Heaven knows, what keeps mankind alive
Every hand goes searching for its partner in crime
Under chairs and behind tables
Connecting to places we have known

I'm looking for a home, where the wheels are turning
Home, why I keep returning
Home, where my world Is breaking in two
Home, with the neighbors fighting
Home, always so exciting
Home, were my parents telling the truth?
Home, such a body feeling
Home, no one ever speaking
Home, with our bodies touching
Home, and the cameras watching
Home, will infect whatever you do
Where home, comes to life from out of the blue

Tiny little box from a beach at sunset
I took a drink from a jar and into my head
Familiar smells and flavors
Vehicles are stuck on the plains of heaven
I've seen their wheels spinning round
And everywhere I can hear those people saying
That the eye is the measure of the man
You can fly from the stuff that spills around you
We're home and the band keeps marching on
Connecting to every living sole

Yoo hoo, yoo hoo, gonna get you

Telephone bills on the company paycheck

Emily lost her mobile phone
Last nights dance on a bumpy road
I won't go out in the cold
Lebanese Chinese in my school
Imagine who can make you cool
Who's gonna pay for this call?

The cheapest dog, the hottest sun, the fiercest cat and the meanest gun
You got to hold the peelings in your hands, baby
It's a safety belt, it's a Christian crime, a rocket ship, it's a joke of mine
I took away the day that I'd be gone- shoot!

The chicken shack, the rising sun, the written word in a foreign tongue
You got to hold it all before it drops, baby
It's a little bit, it's a lot inside, it's a bigger thing than you can hide
I took away the parts that need controlling

Hooligans jump in the budget sign
In the tropic zone, where the fix is fine
Gonna chase it, place it, face it with my eye
Stinky little bird in a dirty tree
Gonna figure out it's your lucky day
If ya smell it, sell it, tell it to my ear

Tigers walk behind me, they are to remind me that
I'm lost, but I'm not afraid

Soul to soul, A kiss and a sigh
Sawed in half, by the passage of time
Halfway home, from a window you see
Chains and bars, but I am still free

People on the outside, I remember sweet times
This old rose, is always in bloom
Everybody's happy, to be a baby daddy
Stone love, with nothing to lose

Life is long, if you give it way
So stay, don't go, cause I'm fading away
Soul to soul, between you and me
Chain me down, but I am still free

Now I can say, those three little words
And every day, I'm dreaming a world
Soul to soul, a kiss and a sigh
Holding back, the waters outside.

Out by the lighthouse

""I'm sorry,
For stones and trees down below
For those who tumble in God's name
To an early grave
Into the sea and foam
Like ships tossed in a storm""
And I'm standing all alone
Out by the lighthouse

I'll build a house, of paper
Covered with words I could read
She had to teach me what to say
But every year we stayed
Out by the lighthouse

I'll build a house, so level
With 7 walls, long and true

When the lost becomes the found

And it gives me hope, to see you there

In a small dark room- where I will wait
Face to face I find- I contemplate
Even though a man- is made of clay
Everything can change- that one fine-

Then before my eyes, is standing still
I beheld it there, a city on a hill
I complete my tasks, one by one
I remove my masks, when I am done

We can use the stars, to guide the way

Burnt out and damaged, I dragged my body home

Flies stick to honey, it's the only game they know

So come and rock my soul, where sin and sorry lie
White horses carry me, unto the other side

Poor boy, I'm waiting for the harvest of the seeds I sow

A flower in the night, with thoughts of days gone by
I've got to ring that bell, and I'll be satisfied

Sleep, dark as the night
Somehow it seems it was all another dream
Soon dissolved in the light.

Oh, we were by the waterline.

Vague, the song of the night.

Innocent to all the peasant gods with you,
So, we drink to be renewed.

On the long, deep river
Where the moorhens cry
As the first sun quivers in the open sky,
Oh, she came down the river.

Soon, all the leaves were still.

The current was strong and the river was so long.

So, we drink to be renewed.

To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots

But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand

Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see

In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)

On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been

Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

It's amazing that the soldiers somehow all know how to dance
It's amazing how the soldiers keep the creases in their pants

There's a funny lightning 'round the corner 
Hiding but I'm too smart just to catch it with gloves and rubber
So I stay put right here, watching the sky for tears
Let the fools and cowboys roar to wrecks

But if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who is it?
Blame nature
I guess I have to laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed 
Has moved six inches, six closer to the west

But this funny lightning I wanna invite in if I could learn how to teach it
I salt the corners of my room because, because a ghost can never be too careful

Who did it?
Oh nature, I hope you have a laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed has 
Moved twelve inches, twelve closer to my god

I will hold you

Our lives will change when tomorrow comes
Tonight our hearts drown the distant drums
And we have music all right
Tearing the night

A song
Played on a solo saxophone
A crazy sound, a lonely sound
A cry that tells us love goes on and on
Played on a solo saxophone
It's telling me
To hold you tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world

On the other side of the earth
There's a place where life still has worth
I will take you
I'll go with you
You won't believe all the things you'll see
I know 'cause you'll see them all with me

One that they could croon

And they made that

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

It's the end of the road,
It's the rest of a stump,
It's a little alone

It's a sliver of glass,
It is life, it's the sun,
It is night, it is death,
It's a trap, it's a gun

The oak when it blooms,
A fox in the brush,
A knot in the wood,
The song of a thrush

The wood of the wind,
A cliff, a fall,
A scratch, a lump,
It is nothing at all

It's the wind blowing free,
It's the end of the slope,
It's a beam, it's a void,
It's a hunch, it's a hope

Of the waters of March,
It's the end of the strain,
It's the joy in your heart

The foot, the ground,
The flesh and the bone,
The beat of the road,
A slingshot's stone

A fish, a flash,
A silvery glow,
A fight, a bet,
The range of a bow

The bed of the well,
The end of the line,
The dismay in the face,
It's a loss, it's a find

A spear, a spike,
A point, a nail,
A drip, a drop,

The shot of a gun
In the dead of the night

A thrust, a hump,

It's a cold, it's the mumps

The body in bed,
And the car that got stuck,
It's the mud, it's the mud

Afloat, adrift,
A flight, a wing,
A hawk, a quail,
The promise of spring

And the riverbank talks
Of the waters of March,
It's the end of a strain
It's the joy in your heart

A snake, a stick,
It is John, it is Joe,
It's a thorn in your hand
And a cut on your toe

A point, a grain,
A bee, a bite,
A blink, a buzzard,
A sudden stroke of night

A pin, a needle,
A sting, a pain,
A snail, a riddle,
A wasp, a stain

A pass in the mountains,
A horse and a mule,
In the distance the shelves
Rode three shadows of blue

David Campbell,"When they catch all they wanted from you
And they find that's all you knew
Pack your bags from another town
It's time to move

I bet you were far to find
Electrified in all this life
Now you find that you're almost dying
And all alone

How could they be so cruel
Pointing a finger, throw the book at you
And who would want to dance with you
Say it's true, I know it's true
I know it's true

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
It's nobody's fault,
Nobody's fault
But my own

When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits,
Better find the one that lights
The way for you

When the road is full of nails
Darkened jails and garbage pails
And the paper's full of heartless tales
Of faceless clowns

Who would ever be so cruel
Fall into the residue
Who would ever dance with you
Say it's true, I know it's true
I know it's true

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault
But my own",Nobody's Fault But My Own,1998
David Campbell,"These withered hands 
Have dug for a dream 
Sifted through sand 
And leftover nightmares 
Over the hill 
A desolate wind 
Turns shit to gold 
And blows my soul crazy 

The end 
O the end 
We live again 
O I grow weary of the end 

O hungry days 
The footsteps of fools 
Gazing alone 
Through sex-painted windows 
Dredging the night 
Drunk libertines 
Stink like a colognes 
From the newfangled wasteland 

The end 
O the end 
We live again 
O I grow weary of the end 

Love is a plague 
In a mix-match parade 
Where the castaways look so deranged 
When will the children learn 
To let their wildernesses burn 
And love will be new never cold and vacant 

These withered hands have dug for a dream 
Sifted through sand and leftover nightmares 

The end 
Of the end 
We live again 
Oh I grow weary of the end",We Live Again,1998
David Campbell,"I wonder how I ever made it through a day
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same
And you don't know how, then I looked into your eyes
And the world stretched out in front of me and I realized

[Chorus]
I never lived before your love
I never felt before your touch
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive
But then again, I wasn't really living
I never lived, before your love

I wanted more than just an ordinary life
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how I survived without you kiss
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist

[Chorus]

And I don't know why
Why the sun decides to shine
But you breathed you love into me, just in time

[Chorus]",Before Your Love [*],2002

We laid down and wept, and wept
For Thee Zion

David Carpenter,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,2000

David Carroll,"Won't you play some simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a-dreamin',
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me
That good old-fashioned harmony
Oh, won't you play for me
A simple melody

You'll get all of my applause because
I wanna rag it

David Carroll & His Orchestra,"I found my April dream in Portugal with you
When we discovered romance, like we never knew.
My head was in the clouds, My heart went crazy too,
And madly I said, ""I love you.""

Too soon I heard you say,
""This dream is for a day""
That's Portugal and love in April!
And when the showers fell,
Those tears I know so well,
They told me it was spring fooling me.

I found my April dream in Portugal with you
When we discovered romance, like I never knew.
Then morning brought the rain,
And now my dream is through
But still my heart says ""I love you.""

That's Portugal and love in April!
The music and the wine convinced me you were mine,
But it was just the spring fooling me.

David Carroll Orchestra,"Oh, I'm so mad about a lad
It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes
They have instant success

So full of passion these pupils are
That girls forget what their scruples are
So when he turns them on me
I murmur tenderly

I think you're great; I think you're grand
And I don't mind if you hold my hand
But don't look at me that way

Your kisses, too, are heavenly
And, oh, so full of variety
But don't look at me that way

When you tell me sweetly you're mine completely
I always give a long cheer
But those sudden flashes behind your lashes
Are nobody's business, dear

Since you began to play your role
I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my wont is weak
So don't look at me that way

When that strange expression of indiscretion
Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus
That gives me a terrible scare

And while you're near, I simply thrive
But if you want to get home alive
Don't look at me that way",Don't Look at Me That Way,1995

A very big deal to me
Us taking some time from our daily routines
Only means that we care

Give part of ourselves to somebody else

And our being together is always
So honest and real to me
Us both saying, 'Yes, I'm aware that you're there'
Goes to show how you know
When somebody loves you so

Being together is my kind of fun

Is my dance in the sun

David Cassidy,"Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Now you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

I caught a sunrise service on a Sunday in North Dakota
Imagine you and me singing in a gospel choir
Spent a rainy night on a river in Oklahoma
Saw the northern lights on a Minnesota night
And our souls went a little bit higher

Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Oow, you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

The old De Soto died on a hill
It couldn't climb in Montana
The kid who bought the wreck said
What the heck, I'll give you a thirty five

So we were on our own
Had our thumbs to take us home to California
By the time we made Denver
With our truck drivin' friend we had wheels on fire

Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Now you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

And wakes up somethin' that you thought had died

No dark nights, because they're frightening
No me in a disguise

She dropped in on me
We sat there, but that there girl means nothin' to me
While she was schemin', well I was dreamin' of you
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you

I know it was just a misunderstanding
That ya saw
I happened to be kissin' your best friend
Who lived next door
And in an unfortunate sequence of events
The next day the whole town was talkin'
About me behind the fence
But don't believe a thing of ya
Until ya talk to me

I wouldn't put nothing over on you

I know it was just a misunderstandin'
That ya saw
I happened to be kissing your best friend that lived next door
And in an unfortunate sequence of events
The next day the whole town is talkin'
About me behind the fence
But don't believe a thing of you hear
Until you talk to me

And wanting you
You don't know the times
I spent all my precious times tryin' to get to you

You don't know the hate
I've been feelin' from the hurt
From the bottom of my heart out to you

(Chorus)
I've been lyin' to myself
I've been tryin' to improve
I've been cryin' don't you go
And dyin' cause I know
I'll never (never) never get over you
I tried so hard but I just can't do it
I'll never (never) never get over you
Maybe I'm not so sure you really want me to

Baby you're aware no one else could really care
The way I do
Maybe your mistake is you've gotta have your cake
And eat it too
Maybe I'm insane tryin' to figure out your scene
And I've got to see you soon to work it out

David Cassidy,"I was looking for a good time
I was down so low thought I'd never get up
Then a midnight lady with eyes of green
Said she didn't look much older than seventeen
She said, I'll take you to a place
That you've never seen
If your lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time

She took me away downtown
To a smoky cafe called Barefoot George
There were other people walking
Then she knocked three times
She whispered to a guy he's a friend of mine
Said take off your shoes and come on inside
If your lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a good time

Well the lights when on
And the lights when off
And the music stopped
And a man grabbed me from behind
And said ya just got caught
Well your under age and this here's a raid
I should take ya in
I'm gonna to do you a favor and let ya go
Don't ya let me catch you round here no more
Looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
Looking for a good time

When I got home with my bare feet
Daddy said he should have put me over his knee
And asked me where I've been till a quarter to three
Said looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
Looking for a good time

Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
Not my girl""

When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I told them all I had faith in you
I just kept on sayin':

""Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
She don't go with other guys
And I don't think she would tell me lies""
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere & I should use my head
But I didn't listen to a word she said
I kept right on sayin':

""Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
She's not like these other girls, you see
And I believe she's in love with me
Oh no no no no no, not my girl""

Well, you might have had a last-minute fling
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
'Cause yesterday you accepted my ring
And now I'm glad that I just kept on sayin':

Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
Not my girl, not my girl""","Oh, No, Not My Baby",1973

Do this for me.

I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it

I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what it's all about

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

With our truck drivin' friend we had wheels on fire

That I am not going to be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not going to be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not going to be the one
To share what seems to be the life
That you could cherish me as much as I do yours.

That man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters
Just the right sound
That could make you hear
Make you see
That you're driving me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize that I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who say they'd love you

Touch your face, your hand

And will you still love me tomorrow

You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken

Scram Jones the Clipse B.I.G.
Let's go

Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)

[Chorus]
Do you know where your going too
Just a memoryeverybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Do you know where your goin too
Just a memoryso you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you

Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kinfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the Benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flip side, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

[Chorus]

Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laundering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uh

David Charles,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.

David Chernault,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored [From Evita],1996
David Chernault,"Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?

Tell me before I ride off in the sunset, there's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're a savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do, I don't care what the Bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them but to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So what are my chances of honest advances? I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin than to lose with a halo

Tell me before I seek worthier pastures and thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
Than have no impossible dream?

Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines
I'll pay your fair gift three cheers but first tell me who'd be delighted
To witness me the top world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I live for one hundred years

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So go, if you're able to somewhere unstable and stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear, is that clear, dear?

Oh, what I'd give for a hundred years

I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.

David Chernault,"(Peron:)
Dice are rolling, the knives are out
Would-be presidents are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground

(Eva:)
It doesn't matter what those morons say
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only twenty of them anyway
What is twenty next to millions who
Are looking to you?

All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll...you'll be handed power on a plate
When the ones who matter have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree to be called

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment, and that is why
All exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay

(Eva:)
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide, there's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be denied

(Eva:)
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems, he shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the workers' battle song
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Rings out loud and long

(Eva:)
Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me

(All:)
A new Argentina, a new age about to begin
A new Argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

(Eva:)
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the Big Apple

But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country

(Eva:)
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(All:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied

How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause
The inconvenience, having to get a majority
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause
There are other ways of establishing authority

David Chernault,"People of Europe! I send you the Rainbow of Argentina!

Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes--it doesn't matter much
She's the New World Madonna with the golden touch
She filled a bull-ring--forty-five thousand seater
But if you're prettier than General Franco
That's not hard

Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
More important, current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset
Your trump card

Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is yes!

There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where we go
The whole world over--just the same
You should have heard them call our name
And who would underestimate the actress now?

I'm not underestimating you--just do the same thing in
Italy please

Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome is not so good
She hasn't gone down like we thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini
Can't think why

Did you here that?
They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!

But Signora Peron
It's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
yet I gave up the sea long ago

Things aren't all that bad she met with the Pope
She got a Papal decoration and a kindly word
So even if the crowds gave our lady the bird

The Argentine/Italy axis does have some hope
She still made a fabulous impact
Caught the eye

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is

A qualified

Yes!

Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like the sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the carefree days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired

Tired? Eva tired?

Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now

It wasn't on the schedule anyhow

You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home triumph
Is required

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
Would Evita win through?

And the answer is

Yes

And no

And yes

And no

And yes, and no
Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success

Who the hell does the King of England think he is?
Tea at some tinpot castle of his--what kind of invitation
is that?

Then Argentina can do without England!",Rainbow Tour [From Evita],1996

Sólo buscaba el olvido
Y fui a cear en su trampa de amor
Ahora maldigo esa noche

Al destino que a ella
Me quiso llevar

Where someone's waiting to be kissed? 

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring 
Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? 

And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night? 
Wonderful music, faint as a will-'o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, 
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

David Cook,"When I woke up I could see
The daylight had already passed me
It was such a fight to fade away asleep
It's a fugue
Come on
Found the chase down the dawn
And I fell every night as it turns
Into light with my eyes just shut tight

Sailing all alone
I thought I'd made it home
But I threw it all away
Oh, where I've been sold and spun again
I'll be falling like a dream
Falling in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous
I know just what I did to deserve this
Though I know it's not a dream

Keeping quiet
Laying low
Holding on to what I don't want to know
'Till the daylight turns to ash and blows away
Missing keys
Bloody nose
Consequences of what I chose
Keep your eyes on me
Don't want my memory

Sailing all alone
I thought I'd made it home
But I threw it all away
Oh, where I've been sold and spun again
I'll be falling like a dream
Falling in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous
I know just what I did to deserve this
Though I know it's not a dream

Oh, where I've been sold and spun again

At the top of your lungs?

For the lessons I've learned,
Never deserved.

Say goodbye to the cold
And try to begin everything, there's life

David Cook,"Everyone was watching you
As everything just slipped away
And all they ever wanted was the light you gave them

You've always been the sweetest song
And even when the world went wrong
You never let the sun go down and fall to pieces
And I can never walk away with you here

If the sun stops burning
And the world stops turning
I'll be right here with you
And if the sky keeps falling
And the night keeps calling
I'll be right here with you
I'm on your side

I can see the way you hide
All the things you keep inside
But all you ever wanted was the light to save you
We could run away somehow
Take the night and tear it down
Never let the stars burn out and fall to pieces
Nothing's going to stop us now
'Cause we were born to live forever

If the sun stops burning
And the world stops turning
I'll be right here with you
And if the sky keeps falling
And the night keeps calling
I'll be right here with you
I'm on your side

And times will always change
The wings will always break
And I will be here waiting over time
Forever by your side
Our love will never die

And if the sun stops burning
And the world stops turning
I'll be right here with you
And if the sky keeps falling
And the night keeps calling
I'll be right here with you
And I'll be right here with you
I'm on your side","Right Here, With You",2011
David Cook,"This is no escape
This is no surrender, my dear, 
This is my parade
My happy ever after
But only if you're here
When I'm lost and broken

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms and let me in
Out here on my own
I know I'm not alone
Let me in your heart
Right where you stand
Take me as I am

We can take tonight
And make it last forever
If you dare
Ooh, we can run away
And take the world together
But only if you care
With these words unspoken

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms and let me in
Out here on my own
I know I'm not alone
Let me in your heart
Right where you stand
Take me as I am

Give a second chance
We can take tomorrow
Make it better, you and me
Give me one more try
Before we say goodbye
Right here in this moment
Here forever
Everyday

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms

Take me as I am
Right here where I stand
Open up your arms and let me in
Out here on my own

David Cook,"I never thought 
I'd see myself down here
In the same damn place
With the different year
Well the lines on my face
Never looked so clear
I swear

You were six feet in
On a one way street
When you gave into love
With my heart on the sleeve
In a world full of pearls
And an endless sea
You were all that I needed
All I needed

Time marches on
Right or wrong
Never waits for no one new
Can't turn it off
We'll make it through
As time marches on without you

If you knew then what
You know right now
Would you've packed your bags
And left this town
'Cause I'm still here
With my heart on the ground
This was the last thing I needed
All I needed

Time marches on,
Right or wrong
Never waits for no one new
Can't turn it off
We'll make it through
'Cause time marches on without you

I never thought 
I'd see myself down here
In the same damn place 
With a different year

Time marches on,

Never waits for no one no

David Cook,"In the night
We're all looking for a guiding light
We're all seeking something more than right
It must be there

Every day
We're all trying to find a better way
We're all hoping for someone to say
We're almost there

We believe
There's a reason that we're all here
That every doubt will disappear
We believe

In a time
And if we hit a wall that we can't climb
And if we stumble at the finish line
We'll start again

Everyone
Every single person under the sun
Has a moment where they know they won
But until then

We believe
There's a reason that we're all here
That every doubt will disappear
We believe

We believe
That tomorrow carries something new
And after everything we've been through
We believe

In the power of hope
In the strength of peace
There's a way back home
Where the battles cease

Under one we'll grow
If we just believe
This is what we know
This is what we know

We believe
That tomorrow carries something new
And after everything we've been through
We believe

That there's a reason we're all here
And every doubt will disappear

That tomorrow carries something new
And after everything we've been through

David Cook,"I was wrong, I was wrong,
Thinking my heart can be my own.
I was strong, I was strong,
When I had a reason to hold on.

Let me fall, let me fall for you.
Let me fall for you.

Don't look down, don't look down,
By now it's too late to take it slow.
Turn around, turn around,
Give me a reason to let go.

Let me fall, let me fall for you,
Let me fall for you.

It's almost over,
I'm hanging by a thread.
With all the words you never said

I'm going under,
So tell me what to do.
I've got nothing to hold on to.
Let me fall for you.

All the time, all the time,
You were the one that got me through.
Like a sign, like a sign,
You were the voice that knew the truth.

Let me fall, let me fall for you.
Let me fall for you.

It's almost over,
I'm hanging by a thread
With all the words
You never said.

I'm going under,
So tell me what to do.
I've got nothing to hold on to.
Let me fall for you.

David Cook,"These two hearts are like a house along the fault line
Cut our feet on nails and glass, walking the slow grind
We locked up our love and we threw away the keys
It’s hard to see you through these

Broken windows
Looking so close
Shattered pieces
I can’t see through these
Broken windows
We could let go
But I won’t give up
If you won’t give up, oh

Crumbling walls and empty halls inside of your eyes
These picture-frames a tear away from saying goodbye
But still there’s glimpses of the way we used to be
I’m trying to see you through these

Broken windows
Looking so close
Shattered pieces
I can’t see through these
Broken windows
We could let go
But I won’t give up
If you won’t give up, oh

Built this place out of blood and bricks
So we could still stand up when the world is shaking
Tell me there’s a way we can somehow fix these
Broken windows, oh oh

Broken windows
Looking so close
Shattered pieces
I can’t see through these
Broken windows
We could let go
But I won’t give up
If you won’t give up, oh

Right through this heart of mine again, again
‘Cause this rain ain’t gonna stop
And we’re feeling every drop
As they keep on dancing on our heads

But you gotta hold on
You gotta be strong
Right here with me if it all goes wrong
To keep you from harm
Away in my arms
Steer you away from the storm

When the sun won’t come around
And your world keeps washing out
I won’t let this love fall down
I’ll carry you
I’ll carry you

So let’s run toward waiting lights
‘Cause I know there’s better skies ahead, ahead

Held down for an eternity, victims

Create stories the world will tell their children
In time, we’ll be forgiven

We can make our escape
From the choices we made

Hearts race, breathless and bulletproof, I’ll hold you
Won’t let anybody hurt you

Nothing to do but be here today
Giving myself it's the best I can do if I'm needed
Use my strength in anyway

If we all work together
We would be stronger
If we all open our eyes
We could see further
If we all stand tall enough no one can beat us
If we all hold our hands up high we can carry the world

And all I ask is that we be honest
Do what we can if we're gonna stay
I want to make you a promise
Love and understanding
Is the game I want to play

We all need one good thing in this cruel cruel world
That we can count on all of our lives
You sounded so alone last night and I could not help but cry
I wanted to reach out to you and just make everything all right
I wish that I could show you just how much I truly care
All my life I promise to be there

I would be your best friend in the world
I would be the one true thing in this untrue world
And I will hold you all through the night
I will be the best friend to you girl
You can tell me all those things that you can't tell the world
And I will listen all through the night

I would've given anything just to wipe all your tears away
I would've walked for miles and miles all you had to do was say
If you needed me by morning light, know that I'm on my way
Cause all my life I promise to be there

Cause I would be your best friend in the world
I would be the one good thing in this cruel cruel world
That you can count on all of your life
I will be the best friend to you girl
You can show me all those things that you hide from the world
And I will be here for the rest of your life

When life's hard to understand
I'm gonna reach out my hand to you
Hold on and you'll see how much I care

Cause everybody needs a best friend in this world
We all need one good thing in this cruel cruel world
That we can count on all of our lives

Cause I wanna be the best friend in the world
I wanna be the one true thing in this untrue world
Yes I will hold you all through the night
I wanna be the best friend to you girl
Can I be the one good thing in this cruel cruel world

Yes I will be here for the rest of your life

I wanna be your best friend in the world, for all of your life

Guess you'll be glad to know

I'd really see you again

I go crazy 
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy
No my heart just can't hide that old feeling inside
Way deep down inside, oh baby 
You know that when I look in your eyes I go crazy

You say he satisfies your mind
Tells you all of his dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
Oh it just ain't true
