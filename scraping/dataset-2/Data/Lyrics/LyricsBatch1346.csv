Breggett Rideau,"The dark is filled with dreams
So many dreams, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of
Oh, so many stars, so many stars?

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of
Oh, so many stars, so many stars?
So many stars, so many stars, so many stars",So Many Stars,2003
Bremner Duthie,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars,2008
Bremner Duthie,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",My Ship,2008
Bremner Duthie,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2008
Brenda,"Higher 'n' higher!

I see this lady took a bite out of you
And you can't go on in this condition
You go blind just tryin' to crawl out of bed
Like you're the sacrifice of superstition

She's so down-hearted, she's what you want, what you need
She gets you started, drops the bomb, then she takes you

Higher 'n' higher, she'll leave your dreams in the fast lane
Taking you higher 'n' higher, you can't fight it

Primal scream, she's got the body of sin
Should be a law against such an invention
A little smile to let you see that she knows
And can sense the smell of your intentions

She's so down-hearted, she feeds the want, feeds the need
She gets you started, drops the bomb, then she takes you

Higher 'n' higher, she'll leave your dreams in the fast lane
Taking you higher 'n' higher, now you'll never be the same

Once bitten, it's forever a game, 'cos her heart will resist all penitention
Now you live for just another chance, to her pleasure that's around the nation

She's so down-hearted, she's what you want, what you need
She gets you started, drops the bomb, then she takes you

Higher 'n' higher, she'll leave your dreams in the fast lane
Taking you higher 'n' higher, you need her love

Higher 'n' higher, she'll leave your dreams in the fast lane

And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time

 And now my heart must pay the cost
 I had the chance to make you mine, but I wasted too much time
 And let your love slip away

 It was right on the tip of my tongue

 Don't walk away, baby

That loving feeling

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

Too hot to handle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

When I heard my child in prayer.

For love will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seems certain

For everything that's lovely is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight

Brenda K. Starr,"Sola viviendo en la decepcion
Sola curando mi corazon
Paso los dias
Y no logro arrancarme tu amor

Sola buscando cual fue mi error
Sola si hubo
Pido perdon recuperarte
Hoy seria mi gran salvacion

No puedo olvidar, ni borrar tu recuerdo
No puedo sacarte de mi corazon
Se me ha vuelto un infiero
Vivir sin tu amor

No puedo creer que lo nuestro, haya muerto
No puedo seguir soportando el dolor
Me consumo por dentro
Y me muero llorando tu adios

Sola y mi agenda mi alrededor
Sola sin rumbo sin direccion
Paso los dias
Y no logro arrancarme tu amor

Sola buscando cual fue mi error
Sola si hubo
Pido perdon recuperarte
Hoy seria mi gran salvacion

No puedo olvidar, ni borrar tu recuerdo
No puedo sacarte de mi corazon
Se me ha vuelto un infiero
Vivir sin tu amor

No puedo creer que lo nuestro, haya muerto
No puedo seguir soportando el dolor
Me consumo por dentro
Y me muero llorando tu adios

Sola me siento y me muero
Llorando tu adios
Sola me siento y me muero
Llorando tu adios

No puedo sacarte de mi corazon
No puedo vivir sin tu amor

Sola me siento y me muero
Llorando tu adios
No puedo olvidar ni borrar
Tu recuerdo, oh no

No puedo olvidar, ni borrar tu recuerdo
No puedo sacarte de mi corazon
Se me ha vuelto un infiero
Vivir sin tu amor

No puedo creer que lo nuestro, haya muerto
No puedo seguir soportando el dolor
Me consumo por dentro
Y me muero llorando tu adios

Brenda K. Starr,"You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy, but you still can touch my heart
And after all this time you think that I, I wouldn't feel the same
But time melted to nothing and nothing has changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves
In love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves
In love again

Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I am not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning to have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby

Always laughing in the wind
I know it sounds cliched but it's all true
I know it sounds cliched but I love you

She wore an old black trench coat
To cover up her skin
She weren't no fool, she didn't let nobody in
Pulled off the highway, they strip searched the van
All the cops are so bored in Ashland, Ohio

She took a picture of every town that she been through
An empty postcard store in her mind's eye
And tipped her hat to the passers by
I forgot and got the man, Malcom X and Billy Graham
They cried out, ""I don't know you from Eve, Madam!""

And they believe you if you swear you're telling lies
And that's the ties by the violence
They are clapping their hands

Stripped to her senses
She wanted to go home
Sometimes he'd take her there
Sometimes he'd just kept on drinking
Sometimes to despair

The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

When you hear what we've done
He started out trying to do you a favour
And he ended up taking your woman

He was keeping me warm for you
Just like you asked him to do
But that fire in our souls,
Burned out of control
And we did what we never meant to do
He was keeping me warm for you

Now darling,
I loved him before I ever knew you
But somehow I just couldn't find the way
To tell you about our love story

I thought our love had died,
But one night it came alive
And all I can say is I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

He was keeping me warm for you
Just like you asked him to do
But that fire in our souls,
Burned out of control
And we did what we never meant to do
He was keeping me warm for you",You Only Broke My Heart,1980

Brenda Lee,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!
Lord! she said casey it's a shame to be alone!",Casey's Last Ride,1982
Brenda Lee,"When I look out over a green field of clover 
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day 
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way

Then suddenly I realize, I only hold a pillow
You're not there, you're not there

I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone confirming all I've known for so long
I'm alone you're still gone

Still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats, funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong you're still gone

The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own all alone, she's still gone

I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.

Color them grey
This is the heart that thought he would always be true
Color it blue

These are the arms that held him and touched him
Lost him somehow
Color them empty now
These are the beads I wore
Until she came between
Color them green

And weep in and hide in
That nobody, nobody's seen

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and ev'ry highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,
""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way""

Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

It spoils the heart for less
But sure as time, all things must change
Not always for the best

With wicked ease, temptation breeds
A strong and binding spell
But the honeymoon is over when
You're out with someone else

'Cause a broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

This world is full of hungry eyes
But they can't turn your head
If you place the one you cherish
Far above the rest

For wild desires of careless fires
Where everyone gets burned
Just look at me and you will see

Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Brenda Lee,"It was just boards of rough cut pine
And a quilt of patch work cotton
A place to lay your body down was that big four poster bed

Daddy built it out of pine two days before the wedding
They say the neighbors cheered and hollered till his face got red
And mama brought the feather pillows and some handmade bedding
And they spent their wedding night in that big four poster bed
That night they swore like that bed their love would last forever
And they'd ask no more of life than the simple things they had
So they planed there future as they laid close together
And later I was born there in that big four poster bed

It was just some boards of rough cut pine
And a quilt of patch work cotton
A place to lay your body down, a place to rest your head
A field of fluffy mountains for a little girl to hide in
Clouds and chasing rainbows was that big four poster bed

I remember as a child waking up on a winter morning
With Sound of laughing voices and the smell of baking bread
And running across that coal wood floor jumping there with them
And Lord, I felt so safe and warm in that big four poster bed

The day that daddy died, he whispered something soft to mama
To this day she's never told a soul the words he said
She just smiled through her tears and held his hand and nodded
And my daddy looked so much at rest in that big four poster bed

It was just some boards of rough cut pine
And a quilt of patchwork cotton
A place to lay your body down, a place to rest your head
A field of fluffy mountains for a little girl to hide in
Clouds and chasing rainbows was that big four poster bed

Now time has dried up all the tears here I stand a woman
Your arms reach out to touch my soul, your sweet words turn my head
Darling, won't you tell me first this will be forever
Before you lead me up the stairs to that big four poster bed
'Cause only love has ever touched, that big four poster bed

Yes, it was just some boards of rough cut pine
And a quilt of patchwork cotton

The bells would proudly ring
To tell the world of the joy and cheer
That Christmas day would bring

Could only pain alone and cry
No matter hard he try and try
Poor little thing he couldn't ring at all

All the other bells in the steeple high
Saw all his lonely tears
And watched him tried his best to ring
Each Christmas through the years

But the little blue bell in the steeple tower
Just cry for Christmas pain to call
For like I said in spite of all
Poor little thing he couldn't ring at all

An angle did appear
She smiled and said to the little blue bell
I've come to dry yours tears

Now, your world you see a round you is just a reflection
In the law of common sense you gotta reap just what you so
So, unless you will live the life of total perfection
You'd better be careful of every stone that you should throw
Yes, and yet we spend the day throwin' stones at one another
Cause we don't think, and he don't wear his hair just like you do
Well, he may, he may be common people
But he's your brother
And when you strike out and try to hurt him
It's a-hurtin' you

Walk a mile in my shoes
I said, before you accuse, criticize, and abuse
You walk a mile in my shoes

On, now, there are people on reservations
And there are people in ghettos
And over there, but the grace of God, go you and I

And then I'd cry",Walk a Mile in My Shoes,1998

Was a jolly, happy soul
With the corn cup hat and button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance all around

Oh, frosty the snowman
Was as alive as he could be
And the children say, he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and have some fun
Before I melt away""

Down to the village
With the broom-stick in his hand
Running here and there all around that square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the street of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him howler, ""Stop""

For Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, saying, ""Please don't cry
I'll be back again someday""

It's another hungry mouth to feed

And a hungry little boy with a runny nose 
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows

And his hunger burns 
So he starts to roam the streets at night 
And he learns how to steal 
And he learns how to fight

Then one night in desperation 
A young man breaks away 
He buys a gun, steals a car 
Tries to run, but he don't get far 
And his mama cries 

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man

I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and it wrote my name above
And just a little talk with my Jesus made me whole
Have a little talk with Jesus tell him all about our troubles
Hear our fainted cry answer by and by
Feel a little prayer wheel turning know a little fire is burning
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path grows drear without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
Have a little talk with Jesus...
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to him in prayer he knows my every care
And just a little talk with my Jesus makes it right

Brenda Lee,"When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair,
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

[Chorus]
When the roll, is called up yon-der,
When the roll, is called up yon-der,
When the roll, is called up yon-der,
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.

On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share,
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

[Chorus]

Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care,
Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

And mama brought the feather pillows and some handmade bedding
And they spent their wedding night in that big four poster bed

With Sound of laughing voices and the smell of baking bread
And running across that coal wood floor jumping there with them
And Lord, I felt so safe and warm in that big four poster bed

The day that daddy died, he whispered something soft to mama
To this day she's never told a soul the words he said
She just smiled through her tears and held his hand and nodded

Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

Young love is such a special thing
It spoils the heart for less
But sure as time, all things must change
Not always for the best

With wicked ease, temptation breeds
A strong and binding spell
But the honeymoon is over when
You're out with someone else

'Cause a broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

This world is full of hungry eyes
But they can't turn your head
If you place the one you cherish
Far above the rest

For wild desires of careless fires
Where everyone gets burned
Just look at me and you will see
A lesson too late learned

Broken trust makes a jealous heart
Injured love slowly falls apart
Say goodbye 'cause love can't rise
Above the lies of a broken trust

Brenda Russell,"Once I thought I was in love
But that was a mistake
For it was a warm feeling
Wrapped around me like a shawl
Learn to love the corners
And the angles of the world
To not love them you'll never live
The only peace is death.

Love isn't a glow or a song in the heart
It's bony fingers tugging through your hair
It's sharp hipbones bruising blue your thigh
It's saying something softly that goes unheard.

Love snarls up the patterns
Of everything you know
It doesn't send you off to space
But buries you instead
Love holds on to gravity
And gravity is love
To love another human is
A puzzle for the head.",Gravity,1992
Brenda Russell,"I stared at walls and I was almost breakin'
Who knew another love was somewhere wakin'
I had to learn to stop, the ground from shakin'

Well, all I know is very hard to measure
'Cause it keeps changin' with the changin' weather
I only know it's only getting better

And what it is, is life

And when it comes to matters of the heart
Who you belong to, holdn' on to
It's the deepest point of view in anyone
Just when it comes to matters of the heart

Just keep listenin'
To the little voice there in the glistening
It will surely be uplifting

I don't want to worry 'bout tomorrow
Or become a prisoner to the sorrow
I'll be the lender if you need to borrow

And what it is, is life

And when it comes to matters of the heart
Who you belong to, holdn' on to
It's the deepest point of view in anyone
Just when it comes to matters of the heart

One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me

And bells on her toes

Watch her drift away

Don't forget to give honour where honour is due.
Don't forget to give thanks to the One who put you there.
Don't forget where your blessings come from.

When you get a little money,
Get up on your feet,
Why do we change?

Get a little fortune and fame,
Sign a title to your name,
Why do we change?

Just like the ten in the Bible days,
Who were blessed by the Lord
And went on their way.
Except one came back with gratitude,
We've got to give honour where it is due.

Invited all the insects to come into her home
She trained them so well
They could answer her phone

Her husband returned home from voyages at sea
To find his lovely wife dead and a spider sipping tea
He drew his knife and swore

He would have the spider's eyes
An army of red ants nearly took him by surprise
The sailor and his wife lay dead while neighbors peeked in
Outside the dogs were mesmerized

By the humming from within
News spread throughout the town of the insects' arrival
People gathered in the church to pray to God
And quote from the Bible

Men came with gasoline and torches abright
A billion flies covered the skies til it was dark as night
The cries were barely heard beneath the buzzing of the bees
Now the insects rule so get down on your knees

That I made the local news

And he can't ever lose

Is no longer inspiration
My precious generation
Is killing their time
And behind their backs
I'm slipping through the cracks

I'm hardly phased anymore

He's come to take my place
She's easily amused
And I know cause she fell for the same tricks
I once used

The things you say and the things you do
I've added them up and they don't compute
I give you an inch and you take a mile
You can't say no cause it ain't your style girl

Could be a bad habit I need to break
Or some kind of sentiment
That I could learn to fake
Maybe it's the devil in my ear
Averting his eyes and whispering lies
So that no one can hear
There isn't anything between us

Many times I listened to the things that people say
But many times I disagree
And I see it a different way
Could say that it looks and tastes so real
But I wouldn't mind if I went blind
Maybe then I'd learn how to feel

Yes man, I'm so glad to be alive
It's a beautiful day and my girl is okay

Maybe we're just in a phase
But we can say we really tried

And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only see it this far
Well then I hate to say it, but it's obvious
I'm telling you, girl, there's no future for us

All talk, no action
So what's the big attraction?

I'm sewing the lining in silk that I spun just for you

You say it's weakness and I can't resist
A kiss on the cheek and a slap on my wrist
In the blink of an eye it all disappears
And again I've brought you to tears
But nobody's listening
Nobody's listening

When every time I open my mouth
Another page of the book torn out
Put me out of my misery
'Cause I can't help myself anymore
I've become my own worst enemy
Don't want to change it

The days are long and the nights go slow
The clouds roll in and the cold winds blow
And I want to go home I want to be there with you
And I know that you're lonely and you need me too
And I wish I could touch you
I wanna reach out and touch you
If I could reach out and touch you
Put me out of my misery
'Cause I can't help myself anymore
I've become my own worst enemy

I'm on my knees I can't take anymore

And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take

Brendan James,"Woke up early from my bed
With a secret in my head
In the back of my backyard
I keep a spaceship in the shed

I lit the engine and took the sky
From up here it looks so nice
I didn't stop until the moon, where I 
Picked a flower just for you

[Chorus]
And I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see I would do anything for you
Anything for you

I didn't want to wake you up,
So I put the flower in a cup
On the floor next to your bed
Without a sound I laid my head

Drifted off into a dream
Of what has been and what could be
I saw your tears, I saw you fall
But I saw us rise, I saw it all

And I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see that I would do anything for you
Anything for you

And I never want you to know
All of the lengths I'll go
To find where the flowers grow

Love is never supposed to be
A present under our tree
I do it because I believe

Brendan James,"She is packing in slow motion the sun is coming up
I am sitting in the next room staring in my coffee cup
Now we are driving down the shoreline, this car is cut in two
I am quiet, she is humming, When the stars go blue

And pulling up to J.F.K.
There really isn't much to say

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you'll write me, don't tell me you'll call
Just tell me you'll see me in the fall
Don't give me a promise you know you'll never keep
Go and find it all and I'll see you in the fall

Now I'm back at our apartment and nothing feels the same
Her coat is gone, her toothbrush is missing,
All the flowers start to fade
And September feels so far away

[Chorus]

Let you fly away from me, fate will bring you back to me
And darling that's all we have

The king of the castle, the queen of the may 
Just me and my sister, in a world of pretend 
Where the sun would keep shining, the day never end

By the shores of the Swilly, now with kids of our own 
Another year over, and see how they've grown 
Then we'd watch the last sunset, and walk arm in arm 
Till I see you next summer; God keep you from harm 
And if I was a flier who crashed now and then, 
She would put me together and fly me again.

And if I was a flier who crashed now and then, 
She would put me together and fly me again.

I'll watch as her body is raised from the tide... 
Her life has been taken, and I'll never know why 
But I feel in that moment, a part of me died...

In our hearts and minds we see
The hope that springs eternally
Whilst underground the hidden stream
Flows into the man machine

High above the fields of Babylon
In one claw he holds an olive branch for peace
In the other twelve arrows for his enemies
For his enemies

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June

Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night

Brendon Urie,"I've been tracing your steps
Along with your dainty exquisite guest
Across mountain land and serpentining seas
These two have been on quite an odyssey

But you're a fool to think this princess
Could ever really love a couple of poor boys like us
She requires riches recherc
Riding with rodomontading rou's

Casanovas have charmed with chiffons
So Chichi chased her with their conceited coteries
Maharajahs have magniloquently mouthed
Their love for me through their menageries

She's been propositioned
Propounded by every pompous prince
Given panniers of peerless pears
And plums, polished

I've been seduced with shimmering, sparkling stones
Squired by suitors to sizable chateaus
And oh, I'm the one she chose

I understand how you can love a man of truth
So why don't you just ask him where he spent his youth?
Oh, look at her face, she really doesn't see
That you are from the dark and you've been lying through your teeth

Anhura, please listen, I really can explain
I meant to tell you sooner, it's been gnawing at my brain
Now you know the truth but that knowledge shouldn't change
The nature of our love, we've broken through the chains

I'm sure that she would care to hear your acumen
As to how your presence is the reason she is sick
But I suppose it's in vain, since her life is ending
When I thrust this blade into her heart-a-thumping

Brother, no

Brother, what have I done?
My blade has pierced your side
This was never my intent
O, God, please stay alive

Dear Pallis, you're my brother
You've tried to protect me
But your dagger's edge finding my flesh
It truly was my destiny

Brother, I was shortsighted
I ignored your cries
You really are the chosen one
The calculated sacrifice

Please listen to my last words
Before I fade away
This is my gift to you
Live for your love every day

Please don't let your tired heart stop beating
You're bleeding, just keep breathing
You will take care of this spinning sphere
I'll disappear and see you in the mirror

Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Before I die, please don't cry

The mountains seceded
The Light and Dark depleted
We lost Adakias but regained our science
Our world was finally reunited
So this is my cue of where to leave you

Now it's your story to retell and pass on
Because an idea is only relevant if it's being thought upon
So remember, never surrender
'Cause the unrelenting constancy of love and hope
Will rescue and restore you from any scope

Evil and darkness would grow

Why can't I live up to my family name?

You're a reckless and romantic rogue
Your head is in the clouds
You'll be chained here all your life
Shackled to the ground
You're not the chosen one

Don't you ever dream of some place better
Or a life that's greater
Don't you ever feel like you've been destined
For something bigger than your skin?

You are so foolish
The dark has been your home
If you elope, I'll hunt you
Through suffering you'll atone

You looked and watched over me
But there's something bigger at stake
My purpose is this journey

Naive and starry-eyed
You are not the chosen one
This will be your demise

My heart tells me to run
You were meant to rule the dark
I was meant to see the sun

When the light shines brighter?
Don't you ever feel like you've been destined
For something bigger than your skin?

Why had he waited for so long
To flee his home forever shaded, where the jaded are never wrong?
He took a deep breath
He was finally gone
His hope was left strong
That a meaning would be found
That had kept him withdrawn
His stare had caught a light
And he fell for the sight
Her name was Princess Anhura
She suffered from the same strife
And like Adakias, she spent most of her time
Dreaming of a different life.""

Brendon Urie,"Yeah, man, this is the softest thing I ever did
But it's about something pretty important to me

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

Fuck it, I don't even know what I could of done
Looking back thinking ""That's what I should of done""
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on
Running the rap game, with that lane
Always got to be up on that train, or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name
But that blame on me
Chasing something, feeling dumb 'cause you all I need
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be
And I'm sorry

It's the hardest road to follow (I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe

If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

When I'm being dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face?
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh
You know the past was a blast but it never could last
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call
Whenever something going on I be pressing ""Moll""
Up in the phone til I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex
And you'll forget, but it's best
You the best to me girl, always bake me something
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
'Cause even when I can't say ""Love you""
I love you

It's the hardest road to follow (I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)

Bent over a country road

His hands weaving through her dark braid
They shared the edge of his blanket
Then carved their names in the bark

With the weather of years
It may never fade away
Washed clean with her tears
But the human heart breaks
With a hurt that runs deep through the blood

Down that old country road
Away from the old Spanish oak

She vowed she would never betray

That one sure-footed right horse
To ride a cowboy safely through the dark
The finest one I ever rode
Was a short-leg bay named Little Joe
When I signed on with this outfit in South Park
Well the night was still and the moon went down
Through the herd there was not a sound
That's the time an old hand knows a cow might run
Sure enough they jumped and ran
Went crashin' through the smooth strand
And twenty buckaroos knew what was to come

[Chorus:]
They're runnin' boys, they're runnin'
You all go run along
Don't try to turn 'em back 'til they tire
Just let 'em run their course
Turn it over to your night horse
Let him bring you back on home to the fire

Well a lot of things that night happened
That later got us laughin'
'Though in the moment we were all strung out pretty tight
Joe Petty thought a clump of chimeeza
Was a bedded down herd of cows
So he circled around 'em singin' 'til daylight
Then his night horse stolen by the cook
Old Bill Jim got set afoot
Cussin' out that cook as they rode away
But they didn't go far and they had a bad wreck
Bill's horse died of a broken neck
And the cook stumbled through the night in a daze

[Chorus]

Well it's gopher holes and steep ravines
That in the night cannot be seen
So he must use somethin' other than his eyes
Whatever birds fly south on
I guess that's what he counts on
Little Joe could carry me through to sunrise

The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory

Enchantment strange as the blue up above

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know

About the latest fads

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings

Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

An illegal wood burning stove; it's exhaust pipe crawls up to a

I've been saving up

And you need someone who
Can share your dreams and make them come true

A lack of communication, what we have here is
Two people talking and nobody listening
Screaming and yelling things hard to take back

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'

There are still echoes of you and me laughing
Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living

When reasons for staying are missing

And I really don't care what some people think about me

I've had many people doubt me

I'm not ashamed of anything when it comes to this
I stay true to the game
And when the flames were burning slow
I grabbed the torch and let everybody know

What the music, the scene means to me
With pride and sincerity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

I've been around the world and back again
I've had the privilege of watching this grow
Transcend beyond the streets, the clubs, the trends
Beyond anything we had imagined

That's what the music, the scene means to me
Pride and integrity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind

And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel

Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannon-ball

Well, I know my waist is slender
My fingers are neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

She hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds

Faint light of the morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care 'cause it's alright

I will get by I will get by
I will get by I will survive

I see you've got your fist out say your piece and get out
Yes I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way the only there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

It's a lesson to me the eagles and the beggars and the seas
The ABC's we all must face try to keep a little grace

It's a lesson to me the deltas and the east and the freeze
The ABC's we all think of and try to win a little love

I know the rent is in arrears the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow's giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

I will get by I will get by I will get by I will survive

The shoe is on the hand that fits, there's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright
Oh well a touch of grey kinda suits you anyway
And that was all I had to say and it's alright

Brent Mydland,"Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.",When Push Comes to Shove [Studio Rehearsal],2013
Brent Mydland,"Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, and shake their bones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink, yeah
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own. On our own. On our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Sing ashes to ashes, all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities

If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks - God knows and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, cleanse my hand
My strength comes as natural as any other man

You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever had lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he walked up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaw
He ripped that beast, killed it dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head","Samson and Delilah [Live at Providence Civic Center, Providence, RI 5/1",2015

Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you",Embraceable You,2001
Brenton Banks,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.
Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm,
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.

Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.

Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!
Fascinating rhythm,
On won't you stop picking on me?",Fascinating Rhythm,2001
