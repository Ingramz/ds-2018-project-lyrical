[First Verse:]

BEWARE!
The man with the braids done walked in
Mild mannered like Clark Kent
I'M rougher and tougher than dead shark skin
This man gonna be have you flippin' like the pages of (???)
Evil like Cruella
Five minutes later I'ma still be hard as an armadillo
Roll like an eighteen wheeler
Shinin' like the slipper
Of Cinderella
And bad weather
And acapella
THIS FELLA
TOP SELLER!!!!
Gonna be that way til' I'm old as Mandela
STILL GETTIN' BETTER!!!!!
Writin' rhymes I'm best of 'em
I'm the arrester, I'm the professor
I'm the nigga that keep his picture on your girlfriend's dresser
Now really
Tell me what you muthafuckas know about gettin' ROWDY
Tell your whole Sunday gang bout it
BITCH I BEEN BOUT IT!!!!!
Now, I kick the rest of you into HASH
BOW GRASSHOPPER, BOW TO THE MAN!!!!!!!

[Chorus]

[Second Verse:]

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Bet'cha runnin'
I bet'cha, bet'cha I'm best that I'm better
Run with a letter
Swift as a jet or keep up with the pace setter
Sparkle like glitter
HARD HITTER
HOE GO-GETTER
SIDE STEPPIN' FROM NO NIGGA!!!!!!
Whenever you bitches decide you gonna get too big for your britches
Leavin' you stitches
Diggin' ditches
Sufferin' hickeys, cuts, scrapes, bruises, welts
Don't fuck with the RHYMIN' BLACK BELT
WATCH YOURSELF!!!!!!!
BOOM!!!!! HERE I GO!!!!!!!
BOOM BOOM!!!!!!!! Â I KNOW!!!!!!!
y'all niggas can't fuck with the man with two tongues, 'cause that's the way I flow
'cause I can get hot like fire
And you can't put it out, it's like tip-toein' on top of barbed wire
For instance, persistence
No resistance, stay your distance
Is vital to your existence
You leave it to me to show you the way out
I'm never gonna play ya
I'LL TAKE YOUR OLD LADY
EVEN IF I TOOK MY BRAIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDS OUT!!!!!!!!!

[Chorus]

[Third Verse:]

And I'm uh, ready, and it looks like ALL you bitches are rusty
y'all can't buss me, don't cuss me
Hit'cha, so much muthafuckin' we gone leave this bitch musty
You disgust me
Trust me
When Mystikal hits the door, you bitches be SCREAMIN' to touch me
I'm the invisible man you can't see me
I'm mackin' illusions and confusion
I'm abusin', your conclusion, and contusions, from the bruises
Issuin' these muthafuckas with the style that them bitches want
FIVE FOOT ELEVEN, screamin' to heaven
I say FUCK SHIT GOD DAMN
Bitch respect me like a reverend, and...
Congregation say ""Amen""
(Amen)
Come through this muthafucka swingin' like a CAAAAVEEMAAAN
And you against me, you better not say it go back in the water
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come
UP JUMP THE SHIT STORM!!!!!!
From the rats
Rollin' out
Since you want to BOW muthafucka
BOW to the master!

I'm fucked up in the head
but everytime I go on- bitch, ran my coat on

record store look like it just got broke with a crowbar
i ain't gotta stand up in this bitch, take your hands on-
(Chorus)
niggas be testin' the streets like dick-birds
then they start day-dreamin', watch my tons and hit curbs
the i fuck my eyes and spit in my face- they got bad nerves
i smoke-funny-ain't lust and use bad words
but i'm in another revolution- motherfuckin' seem with his ass heard
if you ever in your car and you play my game, throw the password
cause it dosen't rest its head with an exquisite hand and they blast
first
i can't stand my next door neighbor, s i'm here to get a transfer
they won't stay over my grass- fur, i ain't right
(Chorus)

(Chorus)",I'm,1996
Mystikal,"Walking through the mind of Mystikal
No holds barred
Still don't give a fuck about y'all

I'm still not the nigga to fuck with busta
? the average nigga don't fuck with me
Fool a nigga in size, ain't much none of ya'll niggas can do with me
Typically speakin', I'm not what your seekin'
Now vision the rhymes that I be keepin'
I fuck like a Mahican, ain't drunk like them demons,
I'm quicker then one of those puerto ricans
Get it off your chest
Don't run on my set, I'm breakin' your neck
If you gettin' upset I'm breakin' a sweat
Y'all niggas ain't ready yet
I'm catching my breath, y'all niggas ain't findin wind
I'm keepin' they momma from tryin' again
I done fucked up more niggas then Heineken
Fuck, I'm cute as a puppy, you smart as a guppy
Now how you gonna fuck me, that bitch get lucky she fucked me
And now that hoe can't stop thinkin' of me
I'm thinkin' of much wealth, come tell ya how gettin' fucked felt
Ask them niggas that know me now
Even them bitches will tell you I'm somthin' else
Bitches, they like my good looks
But niggas can't stand that right hook
They might look but they stay put
I done stomped more niggas than Big Foot
What I mean is I'm grand, you can't fuck with this peacan man
You don't know who I am, you goin' too fast, slow down Tito, damn

[Chorus]
Nigga go ring the alarm
I came in this bitch, and I'm in the swarm
My niggas are already armed
Were turnin' this bitch into Vietnam
Nigga go ring the alarm
I came in this bitch, and I'm in the swarm
My niggas are already armed
Were turnin' this bitch into Desert Storm

I stick to the left like a thumb tack
I hum that to the drum track
No wives, tote no knives,
Bitch I'm sharper then a pair of Filas
See I'm humble, you fuckin' 'em right, I'm makin 'em mumble
Don't stumble, hoe I ? the seen it for your fuckin' gumbo
When a homie compare me, but spare me i'm a rap figure
Please never don't dare me, bitch I barely kept an ? nigga
I run with the real niggas, they kill, they them ill niggas
You best to chill niggas,
I don't fuck with them run-of-the-mill niggas
Here's what you gonna feel nigga

Heavy pressure from both sides, as the brain collides

I'm tellin' them lip lies, I hang with hip guys
I split thighs, bitch don't ask me for shit
You get nothin', no tighter then grip ?
Fuck nigga, don't bother me and try to be, and tired of me
Walkin' out the hood with more bitches number then lottery
Look, I like fuckin' around, but I ain't fuckin' with no fuckery
Luckily, none of you niggas in here ain't cold enough to fuck with me
Fuck niggas can't touch that, no ?, get the fuck back
Fore you find yourself achin from you ass crack to your nut sack
I run these hoe brand niggas from the back of the map
To the front of China
Just when you thought it was safe to back in the water,
I'm right behind ya

We as one must combine to never be stopped nann man

Novice, servants, fiendins, demons, devils,
Griffins, goons, raidin' rebels
Women, wizards, warlocks, witches
Punk fags like bitches
Gold, platnium, silver, copper
Any kind of pussy popper gets wopped or chopped
When Mystikal hits that door, now watch
Nigga want a big cock, get popped like Hitchcock
When I rib shot, when I hip hop, that zip lock that's thick knot
Ohh, it's goin though me, got me struttin'
When E.F. Hutton talks everybody listens

[G-Quikk]
Takin' how long?

[Mystikal]
How long it took?

[G-Quikk]
It took a nigga thirteen muthafuckin' years just to make a rap song.
But I'm on my winnings, in fact now niggas is jealous,
y'all niggas don't faze me,
Hoes gone...hate me,
Bust up and then I may get they lips bloody,
Your back nutty,
Aw, y'all niggas ain't ready for me,
But if you want me, who clamps?
I'm shell-bound, watch me throw down on my first go-round,
Here's our shit, properly did it and now you're evicted,
Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics,
You're all on my dick hun,
Get one, lick one,
Shit son, talk about me? Jealous man, you're done,
Fuck it, it's all good,
I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga either, understood?

[G-Quikk]
Roll like a tank,
Comin' cold like a shake,
Every move that I make,
Be smooth like a, snake,
I got what it takes to make your eyes burn,
Hooked up in the jazzy fifth, with the pee-wee sideburns,
I dress better than a drug dealer,
'cause when I jump shop I'm on my job nigga,
20/20 couldn't see me

Q to the you to the I to the K, K, I be......

Follow me now, open sesame,
You niggas ain't ready for the best of me,
I'm takin' you niggas nuts and givin' you bitches a hysterectomy,
I'm comin' up fast, runnin' in more ass,
Sharp as glass,
Bitch you might think this nigga be lickin' the pussy 'cause my tongue fast,
Hoe, but that's a no-no,
Oh, you mean you don't know?
Mr. Hood Critic told you what? I'm lickin' pussy on the down-low?
Now if I'd did it, I'd admit it and walk around proud,
But tellin' no fables, on this label, pussy eaters ain't allowed,
Now I be comin' around the mountain like ""Oh Susanna""

[Mystikal]
Nigga where the fuck you from?

[J-Dawg]
New Orleans, Louisiana,
Home of the boot camp clicc,
And now it's time for rest of you muthafuckas
to bow down and respect the South shit,
Get your mouth split,
That's what thing that you can do up with this chemistry,
The Boot Camp Clicc is droppin' bombs on the industry

And hit the bricks before I do you in

The only thing that MATTER, is a nigga, to get the first shot
'cause if I peep, that ass is fallin to the street
Bitch retreat or that ass is deeeeeeead meat
Smack your teeth, but I'ma knock you off your fuckin feet
They gone pick you up, piece-by-piece off that concrete street
When N.O. meet, who gives a fuck about a poor neat scene?
We got beef, so I'ma shoot'cha like a FAKE BITCH
Let you know just who you fuckin' with
But I ain't that type of nigga
that's liable to shoot you over no DUMB SHIT!
If I'ma pop ya, I'ma pop ya for just cause

Gankin niggas I'm gettin downright SCANDOLOUS!!!!
[gunfire] YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS!!!!
So when you're out bitch, move or I won't step
'cause if I catch'cha I'ma drill ya in your fuckin chest
I ain't gone gone ride by and pop, cause I might miss
I'ma walk up to your FACE, Pop POINT BLANK BITCH!!!
That's what you get, from out there tryin to go act bad
Not even BRUCE LEE, could whoop a bullet ass
Got'cha, come, get this ass whoopin
If you bringing them niggas with ya, that's nothin
I'm poppin' the clip in
Nigga fetcher, satisfied when you're on the stretcher
You might run but I'ma CATCH 'EM!!!!

(Yo nigga you caught that bitch yet?)
FUCK NO! I ain't caught that bitch yet
I done been through every scandalous sight, and every project
But I bet'cha, when I stop, runnin behind em
Get up, pack my shit and I'll STOP, and then I'll fuckin find him
Yo dumb ass in the street
Fuck that shit, 'cause I'ma catch your ass this week
Monday, a one day when you go play [alot of gunfire], goes the A.K.
Sprayin on his ass like a roach, and if I approach, too late to duck hoe
Drop, run, fall, kick, scream, now curse
How in the fuck you gone duck a twelve round burst?
Hammin at that ass on Tuesday, put up the nine
Go get the A.K.
Bitch if I catch you in the mall Wednesday
That's the day that ass fall
Then it might be Thursday, three round burst day
The day I'm blood thirsty
Fuck that, wait til FRIDAY, PAYDAY!!!!
Shoot'cha in your face and take your money, J
Now wait til the weekend, heh, yeah

1st Verse: 
I'm tryin' to do my thang like a rap star tryin' to 
stay clean  ache my hands  and avoid the game 
but it's hard. 'cause I can ball dope and get paid 
like a muthafucker gotta be another way to pay 
T. Tucker  used to roll twenties by the ounce (ounce) 
My papa got a brand new mag it's called bounce. 
Crackers want to label me a nigga man but I'm 
a bigga man, I said fuck that or do go to trigga 
man. It's the new somethin' cream goin' round, 
it started in the saint town and now it move to 
ghost town. Said tonight was time but where 
your gat? Niggas get WILD when they hear 
Botty-at, Booty-at. You bitches tryin' to pussy-pop 
dealin' herb, slung tapes ten dollas a rock. 
Ya gotta take what you NEED, take what you 
WANT, slingin' tapes out the CLUB and tapes 
out the TRUNK. When the trigga man bails soft, 
take'em to the saint tell him rock another block 
party. DJ Irv had that shit bumpin', T.T. Tucker 
had the dance floor jumpin', whole project 
full of hoes (Come on, go T.T., go T.T., go). But 
if a nigga jumps stupid i'm blast ya' (Who put this

2nd Verse: 
Oooh, see I'm the one that you talkin' bout. Drop 
a little red tape and a stone in the sword, and my 
pocket got swoll from insurance. I bought a 
little more gold and fucked a lotta' more hoes! 
All them bitches know what's up (How they know, 
How they know?) They heard me on the radio 
buddah I set up. Where-he-at hittin' dead home 
if it wasn't bumpin' in your ride it was bumpin' in 
your headphones. No it ain't gone to my head 
'cause I ain't gon' let it, damn it feel good gettin' 
sweated, huh, huh, huh. Uptown, downtown, 
cross the river, don't matter 'cause I'm the nigga, 
the nigga nigga, the nigga nigga. One brick 
object (What happened?) couldn't keep my 
muthafuckin' ass out that project. Shit, that's 
when it happened (What up?) 5-0 busted in 
there was a raid and I was captured. 

1st Bridge: 
Alright, all you niggas on the floor right now, 
DOWN! Get out the way! 
Ay man, why you fuckin' wit' me?

I woke up this morning dick rock hard
Had to piss so bad, that shit made me say God Lord!
Dick harder then a armadello
So I went in the bathroom and drained the little fellow
Flush the toilet, washed my hands
Took off my silk shirt, (whut else) and ? down my pants
I was rolling to meet this bitch in bout an hour (what you did)
????? and grabbed and towled and jumped my stankin ass in the shower
And now i'm feelin better, at least i'm smellin better
Instead of a combination of pussy and cheddar
I still smelled like last night's fuck
So washed my lips, fingertips, but I can't forget to wipe under the nuts
Blow my nose, wash my toes, then my asshole
Foggin up the mirrors, ?? all my fuckin clothes
Ain't that a bitch, i'm already runnin late
Thinkin I ain't got to do nothin, now I gotta change my outfit
Stepped to the closet and scanned the wardrobe
Seen that silk shirt, Tommy, fuck it, i'll wear that Polo though
Girbauds and Polo socks
Slipped on the Fila's cause it was too hot to bust the Timbo high tops
I looked in the mirror one last time for kicks
Like I really had to check, like I ain't know I was the shit
Everything was in place
Pearly whites, brown complextion, daily braids and daily face
Mirror, mirror, wasup, who's the most stuck up
??? bitch I just fucked that stankin slut
Thats the thought for the day
I'm bouts to cut that hoe (why) she can't fuck anyways
Now i'm back on my mission
But before I hit the fuckin front door, gots to hit the kitchen
Cause all the ? is gettin bigger
Man, I ain't ate shit (dawg, ain't you hungry) 
dawg, hungrier than three niggas
Grits and oatmeal, no time to cook though
Fuck it i'll grab that left-over cold cut combo
And now the stomachs at ease
I'm bout the jet, but first grab the beeper, the ring, the ?, and the keys
And now i'm ready for the street
Lookin neat, smellin sweet from my teeth to my fuckin feet
I guees it's part of my job (what job nigga)
Being colder then cold, smoother then smooth, sharper then sharp
So if you catch my in the club don't say shit
Sweatin a nigga like Micheal ?? Tyler don't pay bitch
Cause I ain't that nigga thats gonna play with ya
Or stay with ya, but i'll damn sure lay with ya
Cause i'm that type of nigga to tell a bitch that I love em quick
Better but not beleive it though (why) cause I ain't bout shit

You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine 
Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying)
Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind
Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein
I'm fire like Cayenne!
You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena
Gimme the chance I'll rock the lakefront arena
like Teena Marie be rockin Tipitina's (damn Gina)
Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner
It's all in the way I lay my game down
Watch me swing with the gillotine rollin round nigga town
But everybody think these niggaz be wantin me
to prove that I'm the man
Bitch I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan
I got no love for no b-i-e-otch
Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin osh kosh b'gosh
But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me
When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me
Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do
Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do
One : never gonna change my style
Two: never gonna bounce, three: never gonna bow
I'm gettin tired of being sick and tired
Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high
Suck big dick and die
Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade
the tan shade man with the braids
Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward
I done offended these niggaz compare me
to niggaz that gotta practice looking hard
Bitch-a won't leave me alone
I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone
Black prince of the south that's my title

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change,

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze),

I'm down here slangin, rollin with these hustlers 
Tryin to get rid of all you hatas and you bustas 
Steppin on toes, brakin niggas nose 
In the projects, nigga, anything goes 
Breakin fools off cause I'm a No Limit soldier 
At ease, and salute this pass me the dolja 
Chorus (3X) 
[Fiend] 
Fiend exercising his right of exorcism 
Bustin out the expedition, fully choppin hatas 
Business til about the size of prisons, our mission

No tellin how bad it get, because the worse will vary 
I heard you make em worry, that this for the loot 
They intimidated by the rounds that the tank shoot 
Tank dawgs salute! 
Every robbery we score, cause they know 
Everything Fiend know, mean mo money mo 
Little Fiend still want the greens

Nigga make em say nah-n-nah, don't trip 
After I bust yo shit, then after that say na-n-n-nah

Cause I hang with a whole gang of niggas 
So when we connect bitch

Silkk, you the type of nigga that promotes violence 
You might be right 
Cause I'll step in the club and say somethin 
To get that muthafucka to start fightin 
Bitch, bad as vogues, I'm cold as you see me

Chorus (2X) 
[Mia X] 
We capitolize and monopolize on everything we see 
Keep pistols drawed and cocked 
We got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot 
Check the spots that we got on billboards 
The tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes 
Want some mo? 
Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic 
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets 
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto 
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her 
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed 
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away 
So stay in yo place, when ya hear mamma speakin 
Cannons spray, clear the way, when ya see the tank creepin 
Chorus (2X) 
[Mystikal] 
Hi i'm that nigga that rappers look up to 
If they want to know how to do it 
It could be the little bitty skinny muthafucka 
With the braids in his hair 
Used to live on Tchopitoulus 
I done paid my dues, but still playin the blues 
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose 
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news 
I wasn't a No Limit nigga, but I made the move 
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop 
You can't stop me, so, bitch, don't try 
We TRU soldiers, and we don't die 
We keep rollin, n-n-nah-nah-nah 
All aboard, it's like a band inside 
The group going hallelujah 
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside rumors 
Little bitch sayin he there, we there, be where?

Ain't no salary cap, on top of my dollars

From the south to the west to the mid to the east coast 

Verse One: Master P 
I got heroin and cocaine 
some call me the dope man a young nigga havin thangs 
A thug like Tupac 
went from cheddar to cheese from powder to cooked rocks 
From the ghetto to the lakes 
(to the lakes 3rd ward, Caliope) 
Slangin' thangs in the hood to move my records to 54 states 
Got more work than the mayor do (mayor do) 
it stick to niggas that talk shit 
like a baller they bitch hair blue 
Got more corns than fritos 
Got more hoe's than Macys sell muthafuckin Girbauds 
Keep the muthafuckin party jumpin (uhh, bout it, bout it) 
For puttin the south on the map like Eazy-E did Compton 
Hoo-ride with these gangbangers (gangbangers) 
No Limit Soldiers, mercenary killas keep one up in the chamber 
_Got it Made_ like Special Ed 
Got more _Vapors_ than BizMarkie ever had 
After _Dead Presidents_ like Eric B. 
_Hypnotize_ the rap industry like Biggie 
Going _Federal_ like E-40 
Shock the world like Silkk, put my pockets on tilt 
Puttin fools _On Hold_ like En Vogue 
Used to slang white ice cream, now its platinum and golds 

Chorus 2X 
Verse Two: Mystikal 
Without no business

But by the time they finish fuckin you, bitch you gon learn 
Ain't no fuckin favors, ain't no fuckin friends 
That shit don't mix, this business 
Be bout yo paper, yo royalties or them bitches will take ya 
Make sure yo contract is escilatin' otherwise them bitches will rape ya 
makin big promises on how it's gonna be all good just and be patient 
yo album done came and gone and you stupid ass still waitin 
stackin paper off my work 
Them no good son of a bitches got me livin for concerts 
I done headlined every hole in the wall in and out the city 
Humble cause I'm gonna believe it was meant for me 
I'ma get it, makin moves but still somethin missin 
Fuck how good you rap it ain't shit without yo business 
No business 

Chorus 2X 
Verse Three: Fiend 
I could end the world with one line 
but I chose to make these hoes suffer 
Fill the voice with no muffler, I's a bad motherfucker 
Uncover, unleash the beast, dangerous from head to feet 
Can't control my rhymes, because them bitches seep through 
My teeth, so cold I heats, rising like some yeast, bake some beats 
Meltin needers off of technique and that's just when I speak 
Seek and you should find that my mind is beyond 
and y'all niggas lines behind the times of my first lines 
Shit I'm in my prime, I want it with the mic or the nine 
For mine it protects crimes to the blind (he ain't lying) 
And I ain't dying line goes the paper the chase 
P done gave me the break for me to make some cake 
still dope I cook in sake, got pretty ass hoes to bake 
that's definitely a dumb nigga lure, you want to smoke 
Cause this business makin me a weed conniseur 
Meet the have-been, one of the last men on this note 
Who want to get served by the nigga, the nerve at the throat 
You think you bad but bitch you never had 
A nigga to give more heart attacks than Fred Sanford had

Thirteen motherfucking years! 
I know what to do to knock your stupid ass 
So bad you ain't no challenge. 
Thirteen motherfucking years! 
This ain't no fluke  this pure deep talent. 
Thirteen motherfucking years! 
I know what to do to knock your stupid ass 
So bad you ain't no challenge. 
Thirteen motherfucking years! 

Bow  when I hold the microphone and hold it 
Keeping me rapping until I hoarse and swollen 
Thirteen years and rolling 
I rate colder than coldest 
Getting part of this, niggas don't want no more of this 
Never leave you alone in your life, nigga I'm selecting and selling rhymes 
Slap a nigga that style sound some like mine 
Mad enough you screaming ""It AIN'T!"" 
(This line whispered, can't hear) 
You be pissing me off some the time, take you down one at a time 
I'm be known for fucking over your whole album 
Who want my rhyme? 
Keep declining, I'm keep climbing 
Keep ducking, I'm keep bucking 
Keeping heat seeking rhymes coming to get you bitches off me 
Disrespectors cow sled, (..?..) 
Hard to break, if it comes that way 
It took me thirteen motherfucking years just to make a tape 
But that don't mean that my rhymes one of the strongest 
All I know I been trying to make it for the fucking longest 
Fuck the side of all this, long as you done it 
When I done it, getting blunted bout to run this bitch 
Taking them riders down with me, clown with me 
Leave thirteen in your motherfucking chest and you can count em 

Nigga go pass the vibe, dividing mad this year 
Creative catastrophe, leave emcees in closed caskets 
Hit ya like full metal jackets, cut like hatchets 
Tight as ratchets, and burn like matches 
Thick than amino acids, flip like gymnastics, nasty as a pissy mattress 
Dropping like the temperature in December 
Clipping em, tipping em, been writing raps far back as I can remember 
Full of them rocks, everybody move key 
It was ghetto Djs and sucker emcees 
Handle your business in this industry of competition 
Or be at F.W. Bulls washing dishes 
Bitch I was born to write million dollar rhymes 
Battle in the hallways of Cohen back in 85 
86, 87, 88, hooked up with Big Boy records and made my first demo tape 
We dropped some real shit in the basement 
I had big ol' nigga tracks, raps like pavement 
To come from New Orleans made it hard to surface 
That's when I got discouraged and joined the service 
Pissed of and I (?) before long 
I went to war and served federal time before I made it back home 
No more rips in my jeans and getting my cream 
Ain't shit unlucky about my number thirteen 

I hit the bitch like Bosh! Ow! 
Never gonna bounce could rap and doing time before I bow 
How in the fuck you like me right now 
Told your ass she had said I'd be on top of the pile 
Cause my rap style is my hustle 
I shot niggas up like Muslims 
With the flex like muscle 
Use a, pretty delivery cause it's most important 
I form a style sharp enough to cut straight through the bones 
I came from my welts, gave up my belt 
I got off from Big Boy records to put my single on the shelf, now 
Do I do it? Fucking right I did it 
Should of seen the little children in the street singing I'm Not That Nigga 
Size ain't nothing nigga, I'm short 
Shocking nigga, rah! 
They gave me five hundred dollars, shit I quit both of my jobs 
Fuck em, got some other shit to do from nine to five 
My birthday came, and my sister died 
But next year, Mystikal signed a half a million dollar deal with Jive 
This shit that's tragic can't be no more 
Because of my rings I work at A&P no more 
I drive my land cruiser off the show floor 
Got the time to time to feel pain, sitting on Volvo's 
Coming with scheme, up in my dream 
Who'd a ever thought I'd be a No Limit soldier

Money in the bank, make niggas thank
At ease when we rank, salute cause we cap
Fools run they trap, soldiers bust caps
Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once
Put that on my gold keys, my gat, and my blunt
Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's
We bout it, eyes on our CREAM cause we rowdy
Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages
Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character
I'm ready to bust keys, niggas (?)
Niggas are fuckin, slanging them trees
They gon die in New Orleans

[Chorus: x4]

[Silkk]
I came out the motherfuckin womb, niggas want to combat tank
My ghetto antics, my ghetto tactics
I smack quick, stick another gat nigga to your ass and acrobatic
Nigga what? Black, my M-16, is black bitch
I was born to drop phat shit
Punk your ass like a sac bitch
Yeah, I keep a gat bitch (?) I react quick
Blow them soldiers, told ya, and that's it
But see, I set my shit off like a punt (Go, T, Go)
We roll, I said we roll like a muthafuckin blunt
See, don't come stunt and don't try to front
I'm Silkk the Shocker, I snatch your ass like a muthafuckin duck
I put on my camoflauge nigga, straight up my fuckin boot
Why would a muthafucka who ain't TRU laugh at old shoot
About face, salute!
Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I talk
Tell I'ma soldier, by the way I march (Right, left, left)
I was born to be a soldier!

[Chorus: x4]

[Fiend]
Bringin bags and weed
Lil Fiend live by the soldiers creed
Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues
War fatigues, playing live chess games with the chain
(?) at the gun range, cause I'll bring pain
When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest
But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest
I was best on my recon, started harm and dis
The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this
Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide
Cause the crime design, stay from nine to five
Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up
No Limit soldiers, the world blow up!

[Chorus: x3]

[Mac]
Assassin, soldier, sniper, murderer
Son of a bitch, arsonist, house burglarer
Been there, done most before the sun rose
We changin clothes, when the po po's chase
Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face
And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways
And even when I'm dead and gone
My legacy'll live on
Tatoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on
Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit
For lunatics who be feelin this shit
Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real
Pops gave me the game, bout to bag a feel
We attack like the Men in Black
You react, if you got a gat
I'll never die, camoflauge in my vein
I'll never change in the purple rain
My name manifest pain, I'm a soldier

Yo mama I'm tryin to keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)

Uhhhhhh!  (uhhhhhh) I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto trying to have a little change
My homies killing up each other cause we gotta eat
And I ain't tripping cause I'm running from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starving
I done seen more hoes messing then Marvin
See in the ghetto the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
Until I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media starting east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they predijuce on us all
Come out of the powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
when you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there living like that
That's why the rest of you niggas aint never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
how many niggas in the cemetary don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto got to lose thier lives?
WHY!!!!  Why you gotta make your momma cry?
HUH!!!!  She take you out of the street
cause that's where you gonna die
But you won't listen cause your mind is one track
and your head is hard
And your getting flipped, and your talking back
Showing your ashy act, ass straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall
but that's far and all
And sore and all, it's cool when it started off
Now niggas duckin bullets like dodgeballs
Niggas got me scared to plant my seeds, fear of high's gonna grow
Living in a messed up time, a messed up court
I'm telling ya, you can't do shit no more!
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
that's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
Cause it's your world, and we your children
your sons and your daughters
We struggling, trying to get out of the ghetto
trying to make it to mars!!!

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Dear mama pray for your son, hoping I can make it through this game
Wishing I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
The only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinking hennessey but I
But I can't get too high, cause I gotta keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penetentary close, but you know what?  Cemetaries aint that far away
Before I die I'm trying to make the whole world feel
like our people scared to stand there
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
But look into the eyes of a ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from the sirens of the police
See now my life aint been the same nigga, life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died, before he die little cousin told me this
Get you something cause cemetaries
packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children it was hard 
To tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I like to scream when I came home from jail
When I was told best friend turned into a fiend
I aint gonna lie, my conscience aint clear, when I close my eyes
Of course you gotta realize, god forgive me, I'm just trying to survive
They cut welfare and health care, that shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie having a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Uhhhhhh!  This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh!  I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

Murdered my sister
The only thing I'm tryin to tell is to take it to that nigga
Get that mutherfucker what I tell myself
Make that mutherfucka feel what Chell felt
Heavenly father use your will to bring them tears to her eyes
Fuck the fussing and the fights, why she have to die
Couldn't believe my baby to leave away from here so goddamn early
I tried to tell her that nigga was bad news, but she ain't heard me
Fact was that she loved this bitch
But she found love on the graveyard shift
And how many mutherfuckin' quick lift, or spliff, on the fifth
Find my baby sister she ain't deserve that shit
Nigga you couldn't of, nigga you wouldn't
Put your hand on a women, how could it be my sister
Can't say I wouldn't miss her
But I wouldn't forget cha
Get that bitch for every time he hit ya
He gone pay for what he did ya

MURDER!
Motherfuckin' murderer [Repeat x 3]

Possesed that nigga that hurt her
100% black queen self every women
Nigga you lost your fuckin' life when you took hers from her
You took her from her brothers
And her baby mother from her
But after it's said and done, your ass gone burn like its summer
Even a fuck 'bout a system
Sister was your victim
Fuck, he said he did it
What the fuck you mean you're being a victim
Fuck him, I'll get 'em
Be that nigga to deal with him
Cut him and split him, reverse that feelin'
Committed mutherfuckin' centuries under my ceilin'
The paper said lacerations to her neck's what did the killin'
But that's on my first born to make him my first blood
Nigga you took her from her fuckin' close friends and first cous'
She would probably miss my partner she was cool with
Multiplied by the people she went to school with
Nevertheless, rest, my sweet sister
I'm about to handle this business
Get that thing and kiss ya picture
Heavenly father, he done put me in that water
But I got to get that bitch for what he did to my momma daughter
Never dreamed he'd be the one to hurt her
She died a bloody murder

MURDER!
Motherfuckin' murderer [Repeat x 4]

Into the tick-tock of the wee hour
Shit started to get sour
She was killed by that fuckin' coward
How could nothin' take so much and
No more was uppin', no more huggin'
But his conscience know the truth, so he fucked up and
Her memory was all that was left, so to that I'm clutchin'
She was taken out of your reach, now you can't touch her
Unfortunately also taken from us, so we gotta suffer
Gobblin' down to that last supper
Gotta hustle
Feelin' my album shake the devil up
Reconstruct this motherfucka
I never slowed down, just throw it down like I know how
Thought I do it like she would have wanted me to do it
I still can't believe I lost her in the worst way
She died wearin' my very first T-shirt on my birthday
Now what the fuck I'm supposed to celebrate
Would have celebrated if I caught his ass
But I got in my bed and it's too late
Everybody gotta roll they must play
No hollerin' when to pray
But this mutherfucka gotta pay
There will be no reasonable excuse for what you've done
Even ignored him when he started stealin' from me
'Cause them was crumbs
A raindrop to a river
Huh, a sinner to a christian
A holler to a whisper
She was the sole reason that I got along which ya
But I'm a never heal from the scars of what you did to my sister

Let me go right there, ok we on the air

[Verse 1]
We grew up with show business on our mind
In hope to make a big name
That's why me and my sister
Was a stiff competition show off when company came
Now I'm a live cause ????? shake that ass!
Although my sister was the one with the beautiful voice
I still had to go last everybody waiting
I'm kinda folling niggas laughing at goofy
I either came in the room ????? then just act stupid
But lately me and my people ain't been having to many family groups
Or maybe it just sometimes hurt us we medlin without my baby who be
You was there through the struggle shark
Coming trying to reach the big picture
I'm telling you you hurt when you plan to be a star
With somebody you love
And when it's time to do it they can't be with you
I'm feeling guilty to take a stand but better since you been gone
It don't matter much to fix the frustration
Ain't the same when you ain't home baby!
I'm gonna miss you forever forget you never
But you gonna see the world through my eyes and live what I endeavor
So, if you can see me in heaven over the clouds
You could be proud of your little brother so look down and smile
(chorus)
Shine my lady I miss you baby for your my baby our love is crazy
Your my sister I'll always miss ya
No one can get ya cause god is with ya
Shine my lady I miss you baby for your my baby our love is crazy
There's no other its from your brother
Your son and mother cause we gonna love ya
[Verse 2]
All the sad songs in the world
Probably couldn't express how much I miss my baby
I just thank god that I had a big sister
????? between all the years that he gave her
Even the day that I misbehaved
And I knew that she was gonna get that ????
I could see the aggrivation in your face
When my momma said you had to watch me
Selling your ???? like a witch and you know what that meant???
How your time gonna be spent cause I was too hard headed
But where you said not to go that's where I went
Always flippin, jumpin around like a jackass or I was climbin a fence
Bring me my rockin rock robin my double dutch bus
She had some song to sing to us
Wearing some ???? digust plus
I wouldn't tell her I'm sorry for leavin the toilet seat up
And not cleanin up the tub
And leavin peanut butter and jelly drinkin out the cool-aid jar
I pissed you off burned you up
When you told me cut that music down I turned it up
Causin conflict cause you doubt how we showed or love
You was my flesh and blood
We was brother and sister and it meant so much
Now I'm doin it you supposed to be here
We supposed to be writing songs together
I'm tellin that girl to show up with old Tina Maria records
What you left us with
Never be in vein
You gon be shining and they gonna know your name
To many damn things left unexplained
But since you was an angel down here an angel there you shall remain
And that's always until my time
Your my strength your my life Shine!
(chorus)
Shine on shine on cause we do miss you
There's no other like you
Shine on shine on cause we gonna miss you oh you!

Oh ah yeah

Got them rocks in my pocket rocks on my wrist 

Ninety eight six hundred Benz copped from working the night shift 

Trying to make a million fo' 22 what I'm trying to do 

Little eager too to do what the fuck I gotta do 

Flip optimal like an ass crack 

Nigga puff puff pas that nigga pass the weed I pass back 

Click clack we come strapped 

It's fo' sho' nigga lay low tonight 

Cause maybe you could just might hit the flow tonight 

I did it I said it y'all niggas is hoes 

Paramedics trying to save you cutting open your clothes 

Nigga you don't want to go head to head with me 

I got some niggas that will paint yo head red with me 

Toe to toe with me go to war with me 

You could lose yo whole family trying to roll with me 



Chorus x1 



[Soulja Slim] 

Now I know you don't want none of them boys from uptown 

Come downtown to yo area until Vietnam 

A hard head make a soft ass I thought a nigga told you 

Slim speaking on behalf of that wild magnolia 

My people gave me the low while I was doing time upstate 

Told me a nigga from downtown caught a little uptown fame 

That he ain't seen no real nigga yet 

But I bet he don't want no drama 

Laying with my people and don't give a fuck that somebody shot his shhh 

I only fuck bomb killers dope dealers and real niggas 

Ill niggas and trill niggas get it how they live niggas 

And they thought they roam uptown for the doo doo brown 

Better get face down on the ground when a nigga tie yo legs down 

See that's the heart of New Orleans 

Ask another nigga from another city about his 3rd 

I bet they tell you that the water quick reserve 

Leaving and stanking on the curve that's what they heard 

They got a hell of a nerve to mail mack in the Calliope 

All the way to the 10th left turn 13th 

the third time you in the city of how to grow

And I gotta do em' something too 

They fucked up and fucked around with the wrong ass crew 

Now I'm gon' come up from short in a house full of loaded tanks 

Cup of canned soda for a picnic cup of canned soda for dank 

See we no limit niggas so drama we bout that there 

You doubt that there 

That's why when I'm hanging out it's gon' be out right there

When you bump between the sixteen lines

Win the goal keep ahead keep it live
Before you go get your tattoo rhymes
For your boy pick a bell in the bathroom
Penalized doing it till he get tired of ya boy

Then trying to figure out what I say
I give less than a fuck, what you doing over there
Just don't get in my way
Hear my records feel my presence now and forever and until
Stop what you doing and work it fuck it nice
Just complete it with a licking to the man right there
Tell you mother fuckers what we came to do
It's just plain as day but they don't wanna see
If you don't wanna fight get the fuck is you'll be
In the spot working on my beat
Long time I'm having no compromise
I'ma open them up and them I'm dumping them out
I'm keeping it hard so don't get mad
Cause I'm loading 'em up and I'm running 'em out
Hit 'em with the bang then I feel a bang
Take her in the backyard outside leave 'em in a ring
Teach the niggas not to fuck with us
And next year we gon do the same thing and

I throw 'em off, I'm two scoops from coo coo
I swoosh through your fruit loops, poo poo in your Fubu

Y'all niggas remember what happened to that mosquito
Tweeter tweeter, the MC, the sweeter I be [Incomprehensible]
Stop your water, turn off your gas, cut off your lights
Move you out, cut your grass, watch your kids, fuck your wife

Like a bacon, egg an' cheese sandwich, I'm good
Mmm, like syrup on the biscuit an' orange juice [Incomprehensible]
Come an' let me take you by the hand an' walk ya
I'm the thief in the night that slide your drawers off ya

Watch where ya steppin', I'm a verbal weapon
Bring more pain then when John Wayne came on old westerns
What is the actual fuckin' meanin'?
I come in this bitch without leavin', this bitch that think we leanin'

It's been like that since way back
I used to rock eight tracks before I rocked eight decks
Concepts goin', stay fat, concerts goin', stay packed
Ownership's goin', stay black, nigga, this is payback

I scrape ya somethin' crawlin' to establishment
Now I'm Country Club livin' from the scribble, scrabblin' my talent
Proper, proper droppin' somethin' decent
Y'all niggas is as fucked up as Santa Clause for Easter

I'm a keep comin' as long as KLC keep drummin'
An' the only way to stop me is call the people for me
Fuck them people, I'll fuck over you if I have to

I'm that nigga, I'm that the nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that the nigga

Who that with that say they can't sell, boy?
They from third ward, I'm from 12th ward
For y'all [Incomprehensible]
The guitars on these boys an' get down an' go off

All sides get high when they ride to my words
They mine an' they high when I'm live in concert
Fuck who you bringin', just ain't no show [Incomprehensible]
I don't need nine or ten pack
Of niggas rappin' with me, I'm independent

Make frontin', stuntin' niggas lose their stomach
They lose their clout, they lose their cool
An' after I come in this bitch, they lose their woman
Hello Ghetto Fabulous an' big mansions an' fine fabrics
Like a man, my money an' my pussy come automatic

You don't wanna status with a hardcore rhyme fanatic
Full speed dead at it, vocabulary acrobatic
That's him, that's that rapper
That's the man, that's the nigga, that's that bastard

That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga

Us big niggaz get pussy while songs get cooked
Fuck rough rhymes get hooked and young minds get shook

Not gon' play, don't fake, don't stop to rest don't pause none

Ain't no magazine you know could count these mics I rip
Comin straight from Jersey, motherfuck all those who curse me

You get your ass kicked when your only assets is ass bets
You cry quicker than Angela Bassett, cause your cassette

Bust dust to dust and turn ashes to ashes in masses
I'm massive mashing bastards faster
Question bout my pimping tell your bitch to ask it
Chip-chop like all tops the store stops (it stops here)
Cause I'm raws likes strawberries on shortstops (it comes now)
The Beast from the East, the big future for the Pharaoh
Diss my crew, do some spine travel on gravel
Some fuhrilla shit, go and, peel your shit
I want my, scrilla quick, on some gorilla shit

I hit the Vick's inhaler 
'cause my nose was stuffed up 
from the bed to the floor

from the mirror to the toilet 
took a piss then shook the shank 
oops  don't look know I think I sprinkled when I tinkled 
so, I dip in the sides there be a sweeter by the seater 
cocoa powder, bubble-bath, and rubbing alcohol 
for 5 fuckin cent that you could buy at the mall

Watch y'all niggaz know bout dat purple weed nigga

Light it , hit it , hold it, pass 
Puff puff blow it up! 
See some of y'all niggaz be talkin bout blowin 

But can't handle the dolja 
Gettin sleepy and shit, quitting all early
Bitch, you ain't no smoker! 
Y'all must be used to hittin that dirt 

Sticks with the brown buds 
Me? I ain't got shit else to do 
Nigga I'm bout to get fucked up! 
Two cases of green optimo burned away 

A.m. to turn to p.m. 
And nighttime to turn back to day! 
I'm (still smokin) 
Feelin' sporty in my hotel 

Spent the whole day gettin loaded! 
It's nuttin but smoke til there's nuttin to smoke 
It's nuttin but sticky and nuttin but dolja 
Disconnect the smoke detector and 

Put a wet towel up under the door! 
Nobody around, more dope for me 
I got the whole tree 
Leftovers for me 

Hoo, dis bitch off da hee 
Button up, suck em up, this pet peeve 
First off, don't put my lighter in yo pocket 
Second, don't wet my goddamn weed! 

That's just two, before I can get to three and four 
Five and six, I heard a doo doo doo doo at the door! 
Evidence all over 
I been doin somethin' serious 

Gotta hide this shit 
'Cause I know that's hotel security! 
I played it off 
I said ""come back later, I ain't got on no clothes"" 

He said ""sorry sir, I don't mean to disturb you 
But I smell smoke! 
Fuck I just went to jail for that shit 
I ain't goin back, I done ate an ounce, and I'm a flush the rest 

'Cause I ain't goin' out like that! 
Sprayin cologne and cuttin' on da shower 
Tryin' to clear it up 
Workin' like a dog, but I gotta open the door 

Fuck it, here go nothin! 
The door swung open and some young nigga 
Talkin' bout ""what's happenin'""

Ain't that a bitch 
Boy if you don't get yo bitch ass from outta here!

I yell  ""Somebody help me!"" But ain't' nobody came 

I try my best to put it out then I said  ""Fukkit!"" 

Break  full speed to the back door  one room away 

But the faster and harder I ran it seemed like the longer I took 

Prayin  ""Please God spare me; I don't want to cook!""

I knew I didn't come into Sunday service like I could have 

But have mercy for your child, forgive me for my sins

I gotta get to the back do', gotta get to the kitchen 

But they got thick black smoke comin from the kitchen 

Shit, all other exits are tossed, what I'ma do? 

Stay my ass here and burn or -- RUN THE FUCK THROUGH? 

Already havin trouble breathin when I started to cough

I hope this ain't my calling y'all cause I ain't ready 

I'ma need some alerted emergency units to stand by, paramedics 

Runnin through the fire, and I can't turn back 

Somethin went {WHOOSH} and everything went black 

I can't see, I can't see, I'm BLIND!! 

Oh fuck I'm alright I just had my eyes closed the whole time 

Oops, shit damn! But that ain't my stop my shoes from movin 

cause outside, here I am! 

I smashed through the back door like a ram 

I made it! I'm still alive! I'm still a man! 

Out the house but still I got fire on my clothes 

So I stopped, dropped, and rolled nigga rolled 

Started goin wild on the ground tryin to get the flames out my shirt 

Windmillin in the dirt, but nuttin didn't work! 

I heard a {HORN SOUNDS} but that was just a barge 

See I live right by the river -- THAT'S IT, WATER!!!

I'ma be at the riverfront, tell them people come get me!! 

see-see-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire! (4X) 

Hello? Somebody get the fuckin fire off me! 

HELP!

Where them fuckin people? SOMEBODY DO SOMETHIN! 

Can't you see what's hap-pe-nin? 

Don't you see the smoke? Can't you hear the cracklin? 

Nobody want to listen, everybody was scatterin 

I grab a nigga he screamed so loud that shit was eardrum shatterin! 

I said, ""Don't scream Dawg, I need your help, I'm the one on fire!"" 

He said, ""Nigga you 'sposed to be dead, how you still alive?"" 

He was right -- by now they should be embalming me 

But the shit don't seem to be harming me 

Damn this must have been a bad dream the whole ? 

I heard them motherfuckin sirens, hollerin 

I guess they finally got the people to me, they must have saw me

I'm at my pad actin bad and my bitch got me mad 

But I'm gon let my khakis sag and continue to mash 

Blue flag around my head, gold tank on my chest 

Motherfuck y'all niggas talkin shit out west 

I'm down south hustlin, crushin, bustin on punk busters 

I know them niggas want to rush us, but can't touch us 

When y'all see us, a hundred thousand deep, duck us 

I keep a can of repellent for you suckers, motherfuckers 

What the fuck y'all figure? 

Big Snoop Dogg, yeah I'm still that same old nigga 

Gang bangin, P don't mind, I feel ya 

Dogg Pound crip on mine, and I kill ya 

If you cross that line, it's a thin line 

Between the nine millimeter and that hairline 

Trigger, nigga, cap peelers and drug dealers 

Real niggas feel us, especially them bonafide cold hard killers 

Now I know y'all niggas don't want us to get things crackin 

With all that jaw jackin you bitch ass niggas keep yappin 

I'm slappin niggas in they face for the nine eight

Problem here, let them niggas go, followed by a buck buck 

So forget what you sayin nigga fuck you and fuck who you with 

You shoulda know motherfuckers, who you were fuckin with 

Silkk the Shocker motherfucker, that's my last time 

Made Man, motherfucker, little brother of the Last Don 

Niggas talkin about you got beef with this nigga 

All hoods talkin about you better have a meet with this nigga 

How could I beef with this nigga? 

'cause that's that nigga, (Who?) That's that nigga 

(Who you talkin about?) Everybody talkin about 

(That's him?) That's that nigga 

I can sleep with my heat, I can even sleep with a freak 

I can do a lot of things, I just can't sleep with no beef 

Like you can't eat with no teeth you can't rob the police 

Just like you can't cook with no heat 

When I get to comin, ain't no comin wet 

When I get to bustin, fuck all y'all, ain't no comin back 

See you shoulda known, I wasn't scared of no nigga 

All Mystikal and Snoop gotta say is one thing

Snatch a fuckin' hostage then run out with the manager

[Prime Suspect #1] 
Good and bad  right and wrong lurking the land 
You choose your fate gracefully 
Save your soul if you can 
Life is shorter everyday my nigga make the right moves 
Choose your hustle spots wisely police give you the blues 
Lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper 
See the white boy be on every money and your paper 
Put the weed down now cause we face incarceration 
Stipulations of probation strike two is what you're facin 
In the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce 
Short timin round them lifers hopin that you touch down 
If I see the free world again, I'm a ball 
Put my back up on the wall hopin blessins from the lord 
3rd strike twenty to life nigga I choose death 
Leave a coppers scar wet I ain't aimin for the chest 
44 chrome to the dome, uzi man did it 
Once again Prime Suspect guilty til proven innocent 



[Chorus] 


[Mystikal] 
I'm sweatin cause it's hot and humid outside 
The spot where we lay it down 
I amplify the city streets and terrorize the underground 
Nigga respect gangsta and run in the streets they walk on 
FBI might finish listenin to the car phone I talk on 
Waitin on me, wantin me to mess up, put my hands in some dirt 
But I'm a legitimate businessman, I sell light green t-shirts 
Go on officer leave me alone, I ain't be got no weapon 
I don't even know what you talkin bout, I be makin records 
Hits size I'm too busy for this bull and kicks 
Was it tinted when you pulled this six 
Over to the side of the road 
Got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes 
Let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes 
But I bet I make it home cause you gotta let me go 
I'm too cold for an iron box 
I need city lights, the projects, and the boondocks 

[Chorus] 

[Prime Suspect #2] 
I'm lookin for that wall 
So I can put my back up against it 
Cause it ain't no love from the beginnin to the endin 
They got me pledgin the flag that want to see me doin 10 in 
See it's vicious out chea on these 3rd world streets 
Them people tryin to stop the hustle 
But yet they survivor just like me 
Makin liquidate runnin in them hater streets 
So I tell my brother get the cake for me if need be 

[Prime Suspect #3] 
Look let me run into ya'll cause the pilots burnin over 
I've been doin the same thing since lil 
But now I'm called a soldier 
And I'm older and watch fake soldiers transform cause they own 
See them same soldiers upstate and they ain't bout no home 
Why it's already a livin hell for the average thick soldiers 
Survival of the fittest watch yourself 
Is what poppa always told me 
Why we already misled, bustin hot metals 
I just need to step back and take a look 
Cause they liquidatin the ghetto

Oh 
You think I can't see you over there shakin' your ass 
Watchin' you bouncin' your tities, I almost dropped my glass 
I can't be trippin' on a big ol' booty 
I'm supposed to be a star 
When you see them tanks, you know who we are 
You on a mission with your pussy 
You after my papers, straight asshole naked on your way to my table 
So I played it cool, and tried to act surprised 
Knowin' damn well I've been watchin' this bitch from the side of my eye 
She looked my in my face and said ""Don't I know your name?"" 
You out the South, y'all bout it, you want to get entertained? 
I said be	, I'm not tryin' to be too much, but I'm chillin' tonight 
My mouth said no, my dick's sayin' fuckin' right 
Man fuck all that shit, I ain't bout to pay this woman to party 
Till she turned around, bent over, her pussy hung on my body 
Damn, you know what bro, this pussy might be worth somethin' 
Go ahead girl, handle your business

To make me shake it work it twerk it, take a nigga there 
To the sky, get 'em racked up 
Tryin' to have relations, dick at atten-hut 
What, what 
Whoa now daddy, love to love ya baby 
But you know you gotta pay me, prolly got a old lady 
And a few rug rats at home to feed 
But you tryin' to run that line 
What you think, you Gineuwine the bachelor 
I'll pass you like you don't exist 
And part my ass like the red sea, and tell you to kiss 
You be the same nigga known to get your fuckin' mack on 
And call the wife, it's so precise, and say you won't be back home 
Mama's sunshine all in your face with that southern wine 
Rodeo style till your toes curl and I'll be 
Laying in the gap so picture perfect 
Now do you really want to see a bitch twerk it?

Mystikal,"Every soldier got a story to tell

I done been through it all
Don't ask the way I shoot 'cause I done shot (uggh)
Put a tank on my block
Fiend gone get the scene hot

Greens and rocks
Burnin' flesh
Have you ever smelled nigga?
Been tapped up, ready to die from mail niggas

Straight goin' to hell
But livin' the dirty, dirty
Havin' yah mama worry
That (?)

Tired of being blast at, but didn't cast that
I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked, (?)
Blast back

Told 'em to cast that, take these rounds and add that
But fact is you don't fuckin' choose yo' wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns

[Chorus: x3]

Check my war wounds (uggggh)
My war wounds (ugggh)
Every soldier got a story to tell

My adversary's get popped
Got me runnin' from cops
The ghetto life be a dime
Got me carryin' two glocks

My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drive-bys and rags
And representin' red and blue flags

See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos

Pullin' in car do's
And cut up Jabos

[Chorus: x2]

I'm down the blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die
If the hood call me

That's why I be hustin' every day
Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

See I'm a risky rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga

See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been scared, popped at, and shot at

But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I ain't forgot that

[Chorus: x2]

It's real, shit's real check my war wounds
This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons
I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube
Either me or you right here

Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Lay yo' ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
There's no overcome to this shit
Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq
If you don't believe me check my combat pack

[Chorus: x3]

I got a motherfuckin' story to tell
Nigga, nigga what?
A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?)
Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell

And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
I shank niggas, bank niggas
Do mo' for show
Seven cluckas, fake dough

Stayin' way cut throat
I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin' in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall

Seven Eight ward
Eastside, rollin' dubs
Call me big Snoop Dogg
Follow me, and you'll see how Gs move

It's written on my face
I takes my war wounds
Been around drama since me and my mama
Use to listen to oldies

That's why I'm so old G
Look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside
When y'all was learnin' how the sing
I was learnin' how the bang and ride

Make frontin', stuntin' niggas lose their stomach
They lose their clout, they lose their cool
An' after I come in this bitch, they lose their woman

Bullet wounds pistol play muthafucking fist fight
Hiding in the tent with a motherfuckin chim light
There go the tank there come the round
Throwing grenade get on the ground
You might just get up without your head
You looking for trouble and that's what you found
Take a long time look around tryin to find
These niggas ain't trying to respect our minds
Shoot us, and stab us, and kick us, and cut us
But can't fuck with us when we combine
Get you everytime put your foot on the mine
Flyin metal when it highly explode don't matter how you put it
When you are telling a nigga bout me
Let it be known I'm a motherfucking soldier!

Y'all better talk some senses in 'em
Cause new orleans niggas don't yap where I'm from
Bust backs with a gun, up in the club, get to clapping and swung
And my bullets don't hum, they burn
And it ain't no aftermath if you catch a nigga ak'n bad
I make this loud shit sound good, knock on wood

[Verse 1: (Trick Daddy)]

This time I had to get physical,
So I went and got that nigga (MYSTIKAL)
He was like (hombre), I say I got pounds in this bitch to blow
Smoke like it's yo's, nigga we'll go get some mo'
I know this dread named Fred next do' and I'm hitting' his ho
Got damn it, I'm BLOWED
Behind the wheel and I can't even see the road
Done smoked fo' Joe's and got three mo' already rolled
I shouldn't drive my shit when I'm high, I might tear it up
Shit got my eyes all red up, nigga can't even hold they head up
Got my brain waves, elevating in a daze
But I ain't afraid cause I now see life from so many ways
Done smoked up so many j's
Been high for so many days
So many ??? broke down and we roll with brown weed for days, hay, hay

[Chorus (repeat 4x)]

I'm tryin' to stop smokin' (I'm tryin'), 
Smokin' (I'm tryin'), smokin' (I'm tryin')
I'm tryin' to stop smokin', but naw I don't think so

(Train effects)

[Verse 2: Mystikal]

I be puffing like a choo-choo train
Nigga with the bonafied smokers on my team
I got the urge for light green,
The same way a fiend crave for ice cream
Smoke that, what track that, shit we ain't rollin' to be looking at
So much smoke becoming out the window
Bitches in the next car saying daddy what that
We be smoking on the green,
Give me fifty dollar ??? I be coming in the hood
But you ain't got to worry 'bout catching no motherfucking headache
Under stress I be smoking on the good shit
No matter where I'm at, in a ride or at home in the studio writing
Hold ya breathe if you can't take it,
Cause if ya with me and I got motherfucker I'm lightin'
Not trying to say I'm no hype,
But after killing 'gars then I know I be tight
And I been smoking all motherfucking day
And I'm bout to smoking for the rest of the night
That's why my chest be hurting and I sleep so much
And I can't remember shit
I went to the emergency room already, I think I better quit

They want that soldier dick that you only get from that soldier clique

Now when you shake that ass, I get rocked up
You got a boyfriend boo (Wodie, my man locked up)
Everytime you wobble wobble it gets me horny
So I can ride that ass from the night until in the morning

Is it cool to fuck, or is this about some change

Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that

I'll be there for you baby, just beep me
Start paging soldier, when you want a freak male
I like freaking at your man's house, when he leave I toot
What would he say if he knew that I was sexing you

(C-Murder)
Let me see you wobble then shake it, then baby pop it, don't break it
You want love let's make it, I just can't wait 'til you naked

Muthafuckin' murderer!!!!!!
Bitch you killed my sister!!!!!
Bitch I'm bout to get my pistol!!!!
Know that I'm comin' and I gotta get him,
And I gotta kill him,
And cease all his stupid shit,
And walk with this venomous shit 'cause she's 'sposed to be there for me,
Six years, still tears!!!!
I know it's gonna be that way 
Until the day that your grave is filled up,
I still can't forget'cha, 'cause all you did is spilled blood,
Bitch that was my only sister, you can't just kill her!!!
Don't that fuck with you???   can't you feel her?
That's what the fuck she get for givin' you her real love????
I tried to play cool, and mind my business, and stay out it,
I was supposed to be all in, when it comes to your family share your 
Problems!!!!
I just wish I would've knew then what I know now,
I just wish I could've woke up before it went down!!!!!
Now I'm sayin' ""damn!!!!!""
Wake up hollerin' ""damn!!!!!!!""
Wait until I get that muthafucka, and I am!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Would you come to my house, tell the truth, 
Then turn around and be bout lyin'????
Muthafucka in that water, I know you didn't want your son to rot!!!!!
So if you gone support him, 
Then you can jump up in the skillet with him and fry!!!!
Bitch!!!!!  my god damn sister used to call you mama!!!!!
And this is how you honor her???????
I'm furious, and to her I say murderer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Her loyalty, and her love, you deserted her!!!!!!!!!!!!
Changed the whole story, and got on the evening news and shined,
The bitch start actin', got on the witness stand and start cryin',
Now who the fuck you think you foolin'?  or convincin'?
It must be your fuckin' self!!!!!
It hurt me so bad, to avoid doin' somethin' crazy 
I had to write this shit down on paper,
And show you what the fuck I felt!!!!!
You disgrace me, it's a show of shame,
You saw that look in my sister face, she died in pain!!!!

Chorus

[third verse]
Thou shalt not kill,
Bitch I can remember finishin' the argument 
That y'all was havin' over automobiles,
Thou shalt not lie,
I know what you did, I'm comin' to get'cha, you cannot live!!!!!
Look, you sleep forever is the fuckin' price,
Shit, a throat for a throat, a life for a life,
Fuck my feelings, you owe that to my family and her son,
My children auntie ain't there,
Fuckin' well right I got a grudge,
On your ma, and her lawyer, and the courts, 
And the jurors, and the judge,
Defenses, your immediate family members,
I'm pissin' on it and burnin' the distict attorney,
You stepped down on us,
Shipped that coward out his fuckin' cell and let him skip town on us,
Just like that,
And I guess I'm 'sposed to let that shit go down, ha?  just like that?
I'm makin' it happen to these actors,
My screwdriver, and my telephone bar, and my black hat on backwards,
Takin' your boyfriend, that's how it end,
But until then, I'm livin' for revenge

I saw the helicopter and the ambulance

couldnt care less

I'm out of time for crazy games, there's no need for you to try, and run up on me

Look I debuted beatin' boy bands, go on lil' daddy
Number one for over seven months 'Shake It Fast'
But if that coochie cheesy then take a bath
That funky cat girl can't do nothing but make me mad
I get it started for ya as soon as I getcha
'cause I know that you've been waiting for me
Now tell those other supposed to be
Sorry ass rappers, look I'm here ya'll can go
You mothersuckers need to shut up before you get shot up
Look I'm bout to tear the spot up
I see your mouth don't lack or quit
So if you see me and Nivea sitting together
At the awards don't say shhhhhh
You're mad with me 'cause it's over

This for my niggas in them big trucks
This for all my niggas in them SUV's, you heard me?
This for my big truck drivers, look nigga blow yo' big truck horn

You still could see me in my big truck boy
Smilin' like a lil' kid when I sped the corner with my brand new toy
I got a bark in they call, talkin' 'bout
They wishin' I'd would've came out the garage

But, I guess that's too bad
'Cause your truck used to be the shit until they saw my pad
Strobe lights flash, solar baric, boom boom
Big feet ten runnin' while they, vroom vroom

Another SUV can't do nothin' wit' me
I'm 23's so 22's ain't fuckin' with me
Car so big it make it hard to turn the wheel
I can't watch the TV's from the sturrin' wheel

Shit, plush stronger than the buckskin' ceilin'
Chocolate tan interior really big truck grill
Yeah, that's how you do that there
Got bling and bass, everythin' clean but the ash-tray

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass
Those small trucks you doin' them wrong
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

Dark lights with brights, the dark windows
With the pistols in the hot spots fuckin' well right
So when you bitches try to act hype
I get the gat get the gat 'cause niggas don't fight

When you get to Ruben 2, then make a right at the light
And you might catch my rims will-millin' 'round night light
I played a Jag' 'round rags
And now excursion and escalade 'round upscale

The Range Rover's don't even get gools
'Til it's time for rhythm city or either house of blues
My niggas wit' me at your seat to pick my friends up
My brother 'Rice in a mother-fucking Benz' truck

Fresh light don't need no buffin'
Just call a homie where I'm at, west coast custom
Put it on a trailer and ain't no rushin'
'Cause when I get it back y'all 'round can't touch it

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass
Those small trucks you doin' them wrong
This is for my riders big truck drivers
Even on a bad day everythin' clean but the ash-tray

Ain't no slack in my Mack, rollin' slow the windows down
They recognize me so you know how they act
Cuttin' up, fallin' out, tryin' to flirt and get nasty
Raisin' shirt, showin' titties, talkin' 'bout autohgraphs

I try my best to keep my fans happy
I sign my name I grab the nipple they pull off and start laughin'
Then it's back through the hood, tryin' to find somethin' good
And after that I'm on my way back to good

I knew that I'm on course at all time
And I love grindin' like alcoholics love sweet creamy and wine
2002 and you dodgin' me now
Big truck gonna come up ain't no holdin' us down

Grab eyes, turn heads, stop traffic
My black big truck half match my big truck jacket
Do shows and get paid when I travel stay busy it be gone
Now this a big truck driver

I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song, I'm a big truck driver
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome, I'm a big truck driver

And you know when you pass

Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living

Give me yo' number and I hit you when I make it home
And after I take a bath I'll catch up wit'chu later on

And when we made love you know we went meat to meat
I think I'm headed for a Love Jones
This one hear supposed to be a jam not a love song
Girl you got me humpin' and don't ask me what I'm doin'
Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout my pumpin'
They call her pumpkin' cause she workin' with somethin'
I call her bia' cause she carryin' my youngin'
I made her Cavalier a Navigator, and put baby momma on a Jaguar bling
I for you and me for me
She built like a stripper I don't need to cheat
And when it's late she's always inside
Under the cover behind her cuddled up wit' her

I care too much to hurt you, and need you too much to lose you

You bitter intimidating young long dick nigga
Now suck it, now suck it, while you around here playa hating
Your woman around here screaming fuck me, fuck me

I write 'em, land 'em, plant 'em, bam nigga can't stand 'em
On top, on sight, heads up, bust 'em at random
I got the vest out, put the braids back, put on the bandana
Signed a brand new contract, shot the video in Atlanta
Don't pull me, can't hold me the beat don't move me
You know smokin', drinkin' whenever I kick it with Juvey
Back on my own, back on my zone, feelin' better, lookin' better
Bout to go get it and bring it back home

Y'all thought ""Project English"" was the last of this shit
When I was really only given y'all half of this shit

But a niggaz in the ghetto want to post the crack
Got two niggaz posted watching a bus with macks
Just waiting on the police and niggaz to jack

To people across the nation, thanks for being patient
Ya'll been itching for some G-shit huh, I know you waiting
When you cop the CD, get some herb and ride
Turn the bitch up real loud so you can feel my vibe
I got a long way to go, I'm just gettin' started
I'm 26 years old and I'm still retarded
I ain't talking about handicapped, I'm talking about the way
I talk and express my rap, you feelin' that

Anytime you say my name make sure it's some good shit
Look I'm not your eldest rapper, I stay on some hood shit
Am I hatin' on cash money, now stop playin'
I respect it how it came, now I got game
I'm all about U.T.P. family and kids
And takin' care of business it the way that we live
I don't need a record deal just give me my props
How many muthafuckas you know keepin' it hot

Believe it or not, keepin' my spot locked
I got more season than the seafood out the gumbo pot
Now run your mouth and lose your slot
I make 'em feed for me like junk is fever one more rock
Ain't this some shit I'm famous and rich
I got bitches I ain't even fucked claiming my dick

Tryin' to get my paper, child support soon
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fuckin' t.v.'s and jewelry bitch, tell me that?
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

[Chorus]

Bring it, get 'em

Too bad I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump pump, I'll be right back
We buyin' bars out, showin' scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the peels cuz we robbin' tonight
Beat the shit outta security, we startin a fight
I got a fifth of the remy, fuck the belve and 'cris
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in the bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggaz
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggaz
I'm from the d.e.c., tryin' to disrespect d.t.p.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the v.i.p.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in your body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0

We can't stop now bitch!!!
We can't stop,
And you can't stop us,
So bitch don't try.
We tru soldiers, we don't die,
We don't die, we don't die. 
We don't die, we don't die.

I'm bout my paper, my paper,
Important people on my pager.
I might not drink Alize,
But I'll smoke you under the table.
Don't make me peel your potato,
Don't make the devil your neighbor.
I might not be nothing to you,
But I'm the shit on this label!
Five hundred words might make it hard to digest what I say,
But five up in the morning, see me on the billboards
Y'all gonna keep it that way.
Hold on as tight as you can,
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip,
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before, we not gonna fall, put a banana in the tailpipe,
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six, wearing no muthafuckin' jail stripes.
Been bout it from the start nigga, we raw nigga,
You don't want to, go to, war nigga.
We superstar niggas,
You know who we are niggas.
From poverty in the projects,
To livin' large niggas.
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got,
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

[Chorus]

Nigga want to start shit,
That they know they can't finish.
By far niggas want to go to war,
But they know when they ain't winning.
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line,
Been bout it, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme.
No limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign,
Y'all want to play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time.
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black,
Y'all want to go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, 'cause I drop, by no means, look,
Bitches dyin' like a dope fiend, while he have on a pair of old jeans.
Nigga what?  pistols we all got, sometimes it's all glocks,
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked.
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot,
Nigga please, I got all the g's for breakin' these ki's down to all rocks.
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together 'cause y'all not,
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus 'cause y'all stop then it's our props.
If you want to get it started, then let's started, but let's do it right,
But if you want to get started, get started, let's do it tonight!!!

'Cause you Hollywood niggas can't fade this

Turn off that muthafuckin' radio
And put in a CD or a tape
And let them thug niggas show
We comin' to invade your space
In your face like ""Ho hey!""

Damage your spine (spine)

What they sayin' like they scarin' me
But all they talk is noise
I'm not a toy, so boy don't play with me

And if niggas want to trip
Then we can do this shit
I'm not no muthafucking ho-nigga
I came but i can go
So nigga come on
And let me know what you down to die for
Stay strapped these days cause i don't know who to trust

We'll be waiting with the pumps
And bucking slugs into they stomach
A hundred mini-missles won't miss you
I can bet you we hit you
Split 'em, get rid of 'em
10 of them, at the same time killin' em
Keep my presence to a minimum
But i'm in your vision
Every time you see the thug line
I'm on the front line
I love mine
I'm tellin' you now
We on a mission with no mercy
want to know how bad we wan't it?
Just say we thirsty for it
And any nigga trying to get up in my way
Might i say, them bitches beggin' for a beatin'
So we left 'em bleedin'
Competition (competition), to me is an enemy
So think before you come try to get in it with me
So you can frown all you want to
Get loud all you want to
But now we see you
What you gon' do?

[Chorus: x2]

Now if why'all really trying to get in some action
You heard my song
Come nigga, get at me
And bring your family
'Cause we really need to practice
""Walk it, don't talk it"", I say this time after time
Have the same nerve and courage when we see you outside,
Online, all right
Lets get this party started, spark it
Thug style, showin' em love
But we stay heartless regardless
Hit 'em with bomb shit
Better ring the alarm
Its the thuggish ruggish niggas
Bustin' the gauge with one arm
Like Vietnam, the enemies expendable, so fuck 'em
First time we warn 'em
Second time we storm 'em
Nigga, you don't get no three shots
We not playin', and I know they understand
They tried to test the man
But the man was really a man
So its the plan
Stay heated heavy and ready to die
If not then eat a magnum full of hollow point shots
I'm just tryin' to make my profit,
Get up out of this shit
But until then I gotta cock my shit (I cock my shit)

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest

More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013
Mystikal,"Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours
It's got me knocking on heaven's door
Feel my pain

I lost something in the past that was special to me
You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep
So give love to your motherfucking thugs alive cause
Ain't no seeing when your motherfucking loved ones die
Don't point the finger and criticize what he did
Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid
Will I ever see my brother again time will tell
I feel like I'm trapped between heaven and hell
I turned on the radio to forget the fun tears
Coming out my eyes cause I  hear I miss my homies 
On top of that my court dates tomorrow
Facing ten years added to my pain and sorrow
Baby momma don't want me to leave my kids
We can move to the country and forget what I did
But reality keep tellin' me that ain't cool
I want to see my kids go to school
Feel my pain

Nobody knows when your time gone come
I live life to the fullest, true niggas don't run
Anticipating your death make you soft and sick
I leave my worries at home when I'm hanging with my clique
I reminisce about all my niggas that's dead
A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome
That's why I value nothin but family and friends
You lose material shit you can get it again
But ain't no coming back when you meet the reaper
I done lost to many thugs to the permanant sleeper 
Cause ahh everyday a nigger taking a chance
Only thug niggas feel my pain ( feel my pain )

Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours

But they do understand we making a lot of money 
[C Murder] 
I got it made plus I get paid and paid 
You wanted No Limit so I brought the brigade 
I'm true to the game so I'm draped in tats 
The most valuable player because of my stats 
all the Platinum sales because I'm so gifted 
ya I used to slang I even shop lifted 
When I went to jail and went upstate 
I beat a charge cause my paper was straight 
I wanted a truck so I bought me a Nav 
an I wanted some pussy so I paid for the ass 
I got it made so they call me a made nigga 
If rap was dope I guess I'd be a drug dealer 
I got the feds all over my dealy

Nigga street smarts, my game stay sharp just like a blade 
see I'm a be worth something an see if I don't get killed 
I'm trying to be the first nigga out the projects worth more than a 
mil 
I smash something think about the future so I stash something 
Don't think the money will change me I'm still down to click-click and 
blast something 
See I gots to get cash but I guess it be in time 
now see you gotta get yours I gotta get mine 
And when I get something for niggaz its the most popular kind 
And when I buy something that's for me nigga its top of the line 
Now nigga on the real I gots to fulfill my own dreams 
Fuck going to the game and trying to own my own team 
Nigga believe I scheme shit to dream shit the paper

Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family

I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister,

The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

You know who get ready bro 
It seems like they don't want a young nigga to get rich

But uh
I ain't trippin' life's a bitch 
You know we was dealt some bad cards but
You know
We gotta deal with it 
Life's hard so lets show em show em show em what's up

My gate way tuh hell seems like its constantly open 
The reaper is callin' so I'm constantly smokin'
See-Murder ain't gonna die in vein 
My ghetto ties got me livin' my life in pain
See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever 
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed 
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts 
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust
I used to think the hood was cool 
But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'
And life's a bitch 
They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich

I'm up from a.m. to a.m.
My donner AK hem him 
If he don't have none of my paper man 
If I let him live 
He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now 
But see how us niggas get caught up 
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's 
2 23s 90 degrees
I left them windows down to feel the breeze
My cousin be	 and me and john in the back seat drinkin' off brome 
And to the z
Thinkin' bout the lives we gonna free 
Now tell a nigga please 
Soon as we drove up fuckin' doe was about to close up 
Knocked on the doe 
Nigga hold up you didn't see us rool up
I forced my way in I put my seven to his stars 
No time for thankin'
Is what I'm thankin' kill a bitch what you fittin' tuh say
I went to the kitchen I'm flippin' pans and pots and spoons 
I heard foe glocks
Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room
Its bout that time for us hounds to get 
Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone
Its over 
I come to lay ya eyes buggin' out his head 
Nigga bleedin' from the mouth 
He's shakin' he's on his way out

Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along

I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder.

Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil

Convicted murderers with open drug charges
Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen
Us niggas been gettin paid before we started rapping
Situation getting sticky, cause the ???? the phone
Here comes the brigade, aiming straight for your home

And uh much love to the calliope 
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats 
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats

When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

Watch them niggas you hang around with

Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name,
Man if I get a chance she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm aimin' my move, you know what I mean,
In order to be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
Bitch have got a, heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bathroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
She a TV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at webby yet, so

Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that Aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, ""Man, we got next""
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can

Hustle in the morning, smokin' in the clouds

Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

An amount that amounts to a mountain of money
Ride out with my dunny, fresh up out your mommy
Shout to the tummy - eat, sleep, shit on my toes
Bust a bitch in her nose cause they mouth so runny

Give a nigga bread like ""bless you"" (thank you) nada

Now I'm game with it - ta da!

Treat me like one of them niggas that don't rap
Spinning 'em like a Tommy, automatic my laddy

Money to burn, raw OG kush in a $100 bill, smoke weed with it
Why y'all niggas wanna whip shit with it?

Get this money then I slide and I'm gone

From the jails to the college campus, we've got 'em yellin' in the dorms

And we knock every spot on the charts
Every time a nigga drop each song

That I'd never known
Who loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon that you'll walk

Of a punk ass motherfucker who thought he was the shit. 
Turns out  he was the shit  a piece of shit. 
You see  this young hooligan wasn't afraid to die 
So he put his life on the line to gain respect in his neighborhood. 
Well the only respect he gets now 
Is from the maggots and worms that are snacking on his dead ass. 

[Chorus: x] 
Life is over, death devour 
Time has come for witching hour 

Time for your family to dress up in black 
Time for your coffin to ride in the back 
Time for your enemies to laugh at your death 
Time for the vultures to pick at what's left 
Time for your homeboy to find a new clique 
Time for your girlfriend to suck a new dick 
Time for your brothers to fight over your car 
Time for the world to forget who the fuck you are

Close your eyes, hold your breath, release the stress 
let it out there's nothing left 'cause you're facing death 
If you see God, send my blessings if He's up there 
And tell that man how you spent your life here 
Bust around the street, diesel smoke from the heat 
And you're feeling weak, 'cause the lead got you going to sleep 
It's getting deep, know your peeps? They gon' fuck your freak 
In between the sheets in they face they drop the leaky leak 
You hear the sirens, think about who was firing 
See your partner blurry from the spark of the iron 
Holding on to faith, want to survive to retaliate 
Here comes the Reaper, it's Grim Reaper at your door awaits 
Can you feel it? Pumping on your inner spirit, 
Got you screaming out for Mommy Dearest 
You want to live, keep on twitching, bluff spitting 
Time ticking it's the hour for the witching 

(Quit crying like a bitch, and die like a man, motherfucker!)

[Chorus: x4] 
 
Time for you to lay dead while everybody stares 
Time for the Reverend to front like he cares 
Time for your body to rot in your tomb

Time for your picture to fade on the wall 
Time for your crew to hang out at the mall 
Time for your boys to beat hoes and kick bass 
While you sit in the dark, with maggots crawling on your face 

(Put 50 more cc's in that IV and start CPR, I'm still not getting anything)

Bitches are backstabbers, or your inner friend bank grabbers

You wish you had some rum, feeling numb 
Where the noise at? Losing it, where my boys at? 
Hallucinate seeing caskets, your son a soon to be bastard 
'cause you slipped and got blasted 
Your ?? lies in your good times, 
Ambulance 59 minutes later, now you're on a respirator 
Get on this shit, you're losing consciousness 
Man flashing, in your phat ride crashing 
Unhappy family and it's costing black roses 
Beer on the concrete, bones in your coffin 
That's all you get, a lost soul on the trip

Time for you love to go through your tin case 
Time for your father to feel a little stress 
Time for you step-dad to give a fuck less 
Time for the world to keep spinning around 
Even with you dead in the ground, motherfucker!

Sur la file de gauche, sans lâcode de la route
Jâroule, jâlaisse mes problÃ¨mes Ã  demain
Et direction le bendo, bien avant lâÃ©poque de la Nintendo
Bien avant les Totally Spies jâsuis space

Les petits me prennent pour exemple, mais par exemple
JâmâÃ©nerve pour un rien, alors quâjâai pas raison
Câest les voisins qui sâplaignent, les nÃ©gros qui pÃ¨sent
Disons que jâai pas voulu faire leur connaissance

Ils reprÃ©sentent mon block mÃªme dans leur cour de rÃ©crÃ©

Moi qu'ait toujours trouvÃ© l'moyen de la mettre en colÃ¨re
Des tribunaux aux convocations du collÃ¨ge
Des barrettes dans mon jean aux plaquettes sous mon lit
Elle m'a vu rentrer en sang Ã  la maison
Car dans la ville son fils chÃ©ri s'est beaucoup d'ennemis
J'bosse pour qu'un jour elle dise adieu Ã  ses collÃ¨gues
Si Ã§a marche pas bah j'irai braquer Colette

Je veux faire des sous, me barrer d'ici
Avec les miens, loin des soucis
Je veux voir ma mÃ¨re et son sourire
Faut qu'on soit bien, ouais

Il faut que Ã§a change: j'attends
Les bleus sont nuls depuis l'quotas
Toujours le mÃªme slogan que j'entends
""Rentre chez toi si t'es pas content""
Et oui j'te le dis j'suis pas content
Donc je ne rentrerai pas chez moi
Si tu veux que je rentre, rends moi tout ce que tu m'a pris chez moi

Les enfants prennent peur du noir
Cette peur s'amplifie avec l'Ã¢ge
Vois-tu de quoi je te parle? As-tu captÃ© mon message?
Tu hais ce dont tu a peur, toi tu as peur de moi

J'suis noir comme ma maman
Noir comme mon papa, noir comme mes sÅurs
Noir comme mes frÃ¨res, que la race humaine me respecte
C'est dur pour un noir
En France pour me croire il faut le vivre
Fuck les politiques, les mÃ©dias nous mÃ©prisent
Ils disent qu'je me victimise",Noir c'est noir,2016

J'Ã©tais devant l'block avec Davidson
On parlait d'faire de grosses sommes
Il disait qu'nos mÃ¨res n'pouvaient plus continuer
D'bosser de la sorte, qu'il fallait qu'on s'en sorte
J'lui ai rÃ©pondu ""Vu l'artillerie musicale que j'ai en stock
T'inquiÃ¨te, on a d'quoi marquer notre Ã©poque""
Jusqu'Ã  c'qu'elle vienne perturber le dÃ©cor
Que les courbes de son corps viennent nous jeter un sort
Elle ressemblait aux stars de magazines
Beaucoup plus bonne que la plus bonne de tes copines
Elle avait d'quoi rendre jalouse toutes les filles
D'quoi faire bander tous les bandits
Jusqu'Ã  provoquer une guerre civile
Sur sa route, elle laisse les nÃ©gros fragiles
Le monde est Ã  ses pieds en un battement de cils
Faut que j'fasse belek, elle peut m'faire tomber love

I fuck around and catapult ya

Thought yo parents taught ya
You guys is cho-cha
I'm a goin' buenos noches

And if so, make sure my kids see my cash
And I know, I'm solid like an elbow cast

I'm dreamin' 
I know that there is a better way 
Cause I've seen it lord 
But this faster money is so convenient 
And I need it, say I need it

I spit rounds like a the tiqi bar 
And if I got beef I am tha meet Cleaver 
And I are 
The illest nigga Martin Luther King

Hollygrove, one-seven eagle street 
And I'm higher than an' eagles feet
But I believe in me 
Apple is the cross street
I am just an off-spring 
Born in the ghetto 
That's why I can't let go 
One call will have my dogs on you like an echo 
Baby I am the real deal no picole (uh) 
Spit cical cell psycho 
I go off like a mothafuckin' rifle 
And I from
The underground baby like a pipe hole 
I will stand tall like light poles

I'm cool like L.A. nights 
I'm tight like ballet tights 
A juelz I swear of tha day I pissed crystal 
These bitches tryna kick it like Jun Tao
I gotta watch my head in the battle 
I'm just tryna stay ahead of my shadow 
And I'm floatin' like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and raddle snakes 
But I promise I will take a nigga off like Saturday
Got money to validate

Different color of diamonds
Make me look like a salad plate, 
I'm straight out tha alley way

But I'm a G it won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me, yeah
Until you ridin to elate me
And don't wake me

Beauty reaches for the light
From the shadow of your smile
Into my arms

There's a flower in my field you know
Holding love up like a shield
Now I know we have it sealed
Here in my heart

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

Where the stream begins to flow
A life of love that springs you know
From every word
Into my soul

Treasure buried deep inside
Turns the hands way back in time you know
Leaving all our past behind
Can we let it go?

Every night I turn the light down slowly
And watch you in your afterglow
I want to get close to you
Tell me you want me to

What can I do? 
I need you now
And I want you now
In my life

We've been holding on
For things to change
The fear is gone
We've turned the page

In the book of love
And to know this love
Is to own it all 
From high above

I feel the call
Of your love
My love
I want to get close to you

Tell me you want me to
What can I do?

Underneath Living Legends Reebok's
I'm bound to free speech thoughts, seep around rocks
Volcanic or crack, hard to hold back
Go with the flow, know what you know and show that
Too relevant, but I go back like keggers on a hill, five on a dope sack
Smoke stack, think A-C, shrink wrap
Rap with a shrink before you and ink the tat
That's permanent, life learning it, pat

Slave ships, middle passage, crack cocaine
Ten slap in the 'lac, corner boys ground packs
In the belly of the beast where the life go flat
But the music is the remedy, inhale my rhythm steadily
Perched on the curb, watch church converge
It's the meeting of the minds, at time, light occurs
How we cultivated words like they sacred herbs
Put it in your pipe and puff it, squares can't touch it
Rough and rugged, how you love it, with no budget
Independent game, man, with my slang tang
You can do the same thang, utilize your damn brain
Metaphors are mountains, countless bouncing
A multitude in viewed, clubs and houses
We rain like fountains to wash it clean

The rhymes turn wienies to red bulls
The feeling is a whole 'nother level
The drums, the bass, the snares and the treble
So let it go, count me in, I'm on all corners
Winter, summer, spring, then I fall on ya

Got me irate, it's high stake, so why wait?
Move now, roll out
Hate it when hip hop's finest sold out
My gold out, but I'm pouring my soul out

N Phase,"This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye",Kiss and Say Goodbye,1994

A little bubble bath and some whip cream too
Just bring your body and an pen mind
And when i lay you down just let your soul unwind

I'll lick your body, now I know what's on your mind
You want me to go there (yeah that'll be fine)

I want to turn you out,and make you soaking wet
'Cause tonight will be a night I know you won't forget
I like to you you sweat
And the look in our eyes is telling me that you want me to come inside!

You feel so good baby
I hope this feeling never ends
So won't you hold me tight?
And I'll love you through the night

What is it telling you?
Where does it begin and where does it end?
Question the nature of your orders
Question the nature of your orders
Question the nature of your orders
What do they want from you?
A rendezvous upon the sound
The cars rev up the word goes round
The words are weapons of their will
Their words can hurt
Their words can kill
A burning phrase can burn a town
A syllable can bring you down
Their languages are coded
Your image is eroded
Listen to the sound you heard
Learn to fight against their word
Vocabularies of death
Destruction in their breath
They use the lie
They use the myth
Seek only to confuse
And liberty abuse
The lies they tell are pretty
And blow up another city
They steal away your freedom
And your love
Their sentimental calling signs
Are calculatingly designed
To rob you of your mind and time
And still you listen to
The lulling drone of reassuring voices
Tunes to take away your choices
Make you slaves to fancy words and phrases
Until you're pushing up the daisies
They steal away your freedom
And your love",Coded Languages,1995

I wanna trust you baby 
I wanna trust you baby 
Wanna trust you baby (trust me I love you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me I need you) 
I wanna trust you baby (trust me I want you) 
Wanna trust you babe (trust me) 
Trust me I love you 
Trust me I need you 
Trust me I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
Baby why don'tcha honey why won'tcha 
accept the fact that it's not just the knack 
that I care, so please let me share 
special moments, moments so rare 
Check it out, if I could give you the world, you know I'd do it 
Everything at your feet - ain't nothin to it 
But it's hard sweetheart, and it's rough out here 
but I doubt there, is anybody else for me 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
Mmm the things I feel, they are for real 
I'm past the point of dwellin, on the sex appeal 
Mad chicks sweat me, but I desire your womanness 
Dude sweats you, but I'm the best 
Listen, we could build a future together 
No doll and I would never soup you ever, never 
I'm buggin out, over the thought of you leavin 
Tried to step to you, but now you're retreatin 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

I do believe you do care 
To tell you the truth, I am scared 
Some freaky people out there 
You know? 

Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
I sent you flowers and, I sat for hours and 
contemplated, the state of our affairs and I find there 
is no way out I'm in a love lock 
The funny thing about it I don't wanna even stop, so 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

[Guru] 
So now you know the flavor 
It's not about the stuff I gave ya 
and my behavior is based on strong 
feelings I have, of you and me, it's like a bond 
A treasure, not to be corny but word 
I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve 
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you 
But we should never ever, try to destroy two 
hearts joined, intertwined with a passion 
Give me a chance love, that's all I'm askin 
and furthermore, you can be sure that I'll do 
every little thing you need, yes it's true 
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you 

[N'Dea] 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 
Trust me, I love you 
Trust me, I need you 
Trust me, I want you 
Trust me.. 

Love is so risky y'know 
I want you to do and show 
me all of you openly 
Honestly.. 

I wanna trust you baby (trust me, I love you)

Christine, she's free 

Guitar playin' through the night
Nobody could hear her 'cause she played so quiet

Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed 
She stepped inside of me, she said don't ever lie to me 
This heart of mine can be yours 
Yea that's what she said 
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stole 
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head

Do you want to be loved for real, do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be...loved, (Yes, I want to be loved for real) 
For real, (Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 

Now, I'm down by the river, taking off my shoes 
Jump in the water, wash away these blues 
Now out into the ocean, the current takes hold 
Words already been spoken, tales already been told 
Heart's already been broken, wounds already been healed 
Do you wannabe loved, do you want to 
Do you wannabe love for real. 

[Chorus (2x)] 
Her eyes were hazel brown, she laughed the sweetest sound 
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke 
She help to ease my pain, she stayed through pouring rain 
And I gave her all that she could take till she broke 
She fit me like a glove, she taught me how to love 
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke Chorus (4x)",Love for Real,2000

She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, was one and the same
We all meet somewhere in the middle
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same

I wish I could touch you in some totally new fashion
Who are you girl, I'm a man, now I can't guarantee your complete satisfaction

Yo me pregunto porque, no nos resulto

El tiempo de nosotros ya paso

QuizÃ¡s yo me di cuenta, pero tu no

N'Klabe,"Olvidar, y sentir depender, eso dicen

Dicen que el amor es la razÃ³n
Principal para que el corazÃ³n
Sienta temor al entregarse al dolor

Dicen que el amor es dejar huellas
Tocar el cielo alcanzar una estrella
Es depender sin entender como olvidar

Olvidar, un sentimiento
Que el tiempo no puede borras
Y sentir, que eres un barco
A la deriva y no quieres salir
Por depender, de un sentimiento
Que me hiere y no puedo entender
Te hace llorar te hace sufrir
Aveces nos hace reÃ­r
Eso dicen

Dicen que el amor no cree en el tiempo
Que se convierte en un sentimiento
Y con un beso te hace pensar que puedes volar

Dicen que el amor no tiene reglas
No cree en distancias no siente barreras
Es aprender sin entender como olvidar

Olvidar, un sentimiento
Que el tiempo no puede borras
Y sentir, que eres un barco
A la deriva y no quieres salir
Por depender, de un sentimiento
Que me hiere y no puedo entender
Te hace llorar te hace sufrir
Aveces nos hace reÃ­r
Eso dicen
Que  el amor puede mas que la razÃ³n
Que la mente nunca enseÃ±a al corazÃ³n a olvidar

(que la mente nunca enseÃ±a al corazÃ³n)(eso dicen)
Ay no no, no no, por que la conciencia no esta de acuerdo con la razÃ³n
(que la mente nunca enseÃ±a al corazÃ³n)(eso dicen)
Y escuchalo bien, y si la mente dice una cosa la contradice mi corazÃ³n

(que la mente nunca enseÃ±a al corazÃ³n)(eso dicen)
Te hace sentir, sentir que estas en las nubes y en realidad no tienes control

Ja, llega sin invitaciÃ³n

(que el amor puede mas que la razÃ³n)
Toco la puerta entro y se quedo

(que el amor puede mas que la razÃ³n)
Muchas veces te trae alegrÃ­a

(que el amor puede mas que la razÃ³n)
Y otras veces tristeza y desolaciÃ³n

(que el amor puede mas que la razÃ³n)
Y como juega con tus controles

(que el amor puede mas que la razÃ³n)
Pues, hay que aceptarlo es el amor

Y esto que dice
Y esto que te traigo esta n'klabe

Por ahÃ­ hablan, que por ahÃ­ dicen

Que me abre la maÃ±ana
Tu amor me parte en dos el occidente
Me clava de repente
Y me convierte en masa que se amolda
A una ilusiÃ³n ardiente

Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho al alma
Ãtame al pulgar derecho de tu corazÃ³n
Y dime como estÃ¡ mi amor en tu amor
FrÃ­o, frÃ­o como el agua del rÃ­o
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calla
Y se enciende si es que acaso le quieres

Tu amor despierta y lava su carita
De rosas me salpica
Y sin saber es una vÃ­a lÃ¡ctea
Que gira y me da vida
Tu amor lo guardo dentro de mis ojos
Como una lagrimita
Y no los lloro para que no salgan
Tus besos de mi vista
Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz

O le pego un parcho a mi alma
Ãtame al pulgar derecho de tu corazÃ³n
Y dime como estÃ¡ mi amor en tu amor
FrÃ­o, frÃ­o como el agua del rÃ­o
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calla
Y se enciende si es que acaso le quieres
Pudiera ser un farolito 
Y encender tu luz

(para encender mi luz)
Hasta que quieras tÃº

I put my hands in my pockets
They jiggle 'cause they full of change,
Sometimes bein' broke will make ya fall astray
But I got a better grip on myself

So I avoid gettin' played short like a elf
Bust her side bust her in the head
That white ? yoke come runnin' out his neck
I'm tryin' to stack a grip so don't let me hit this dank

'Cause if I hit this dank, I'm a shoot me a bitch
Fuck it, *puff*, bang bang,
Five minutes later, the cops came
I'm settin' up shop for the black market
So if I aim at your mark-ass you're a target
Told you that I'd come but I came insane
Born braincell killas, scramblin niggas brains
If you gotta go you gotta go I like the six-fo
I'm pullin GTA's, it ain't yo's no mo'
Then I take it and strip it down and leave nothin but the frame
Then I'm gonna sell my cousin the gold thangs
Pop a burn and turn it over like a flapjack
Mo money mo money for black market

On the black market, yeeeaah

Creepin move with swiftness in the dark
And ain't no stoppin, once a nigga start
It ain't nothin new, up under the sun for days and days
Under the moon, is where I was born and raised
And doomed for life, nigga this ain't no daylight
I love it, murderin muthafuckas in the night
Deuced up ready to make his mark a underground target
Hooked up with black market now peep
Shit gets deeper and deeper, meet me
The doomstown grim reaper, and PIT
Platinum, Mister Doctor Lynch Hung
We do your ass in good just for fun
Fifteen inches in your ass bitch
Take it and love it, but I ain't talking bout no dick
14 suns and moons, somethin you can assume
That on the 15th marks my day for doom
Buck em and fuck em with doomsday productions
Eclipse a crip if I catch you fuckin with my grip
you'll find your ass dead in a graveyard
And I'ma continue on my ?

Peep me eatin dead cock
Ya trip cus eatin dead pussy clit'll make ya sick
But its that season so my reason is legit
I'm havin fits, I've dreamed of eatin bloody pussy clit since I was 6

That nigga that's from the block killin off that cock
So nigga, sheeeit
Baby barbeque ribs and guts, and uh

It wouldn't work without the sick
So page a nigga quick so I can serve you some of that shit
And have you murderin your biatch, violently
I've been keyed for 20 minutes and feel like killin
Loadin that milli-milli its that infant killa

You lay yo eyes up on my 4-4
And notice every curve in my strap
As them tears roll down
Flash yo life as ya fade to black
If that gat wasn't all up in yo face
Reminisce of yo folks, yo bitch, yo kids, yo fate
Replace, take it down to the South, get deep
Think of mobs at your funeral locc, and all ya family
Huh, its kind of crazy you could lose all of these things so quick
And what's worse, nigga shot you for the fuck of it, yeah
Never know I'd be the one to have your life in my hand

That niggas life won't last
Keep listenin while I guide right down into your throat
Dig that barrel in your neck, watch your bitch-ass choke
No hope, no joke, I'm savin you the pain of old age
All I ask for is yo muthafuckin grip in exchange
One to the brain, in the throat out the skull
From the big chrome gat, peeled cap relation, so
Now ya niggas know, one mo dead muthafucka on the street

Last night was a blur, but all I remember is
Black shirt, bare carats on my wrist
Me and a couple men rollin' up in a whip
Met a pretty young lady, should I say bitch
Will I ever see you again
Always thinkin' for another man's riches
Why do you do this to us men
And that's why we call them bitches
See I don't understand, she wasn't with a man
How could I leave without a number in my hand

That can mean what you want it to mean
Popped to the ladies for a sec (Uh, I'll be back in five, yeah?)
But when I came back out he left (I felt so alone)
He left me standing in my LBD and my bang bang shoes
I was so confused

'Cos you could be the one to make a change in my world
Maybe one day I'll put a ring around your finger
You should try bein' with a singer
And do you know the meaning of a stark in jail
Until we meet again, my heart's on bail
Wherever you are right now, I just wanna let you know that

Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
N-Dubz, N-Dubz, N-Dubz

It's like first things first
You'd probably think I'm a chap with good manners
Well, you're wrong I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the worst of the worst an' I ain't boastin' 'bout my verses
I'm speaking' 'bout the way I run around snatching purses

For every meaning there's a purpose
Just because I never went to school it don't mean that I can't be perfect
For screaming' out loud we's addicted to money like two fingers tapping
On wherever there's a vein

And believe me, yeah we proud 'cause life is getting sicker by the day
And therefore we'll always stick around
Tonight you see the size of me, you wouldn't think I'm any harm in it?
Think again, I'll take your *** nicely

Chat up your wife to be, middle class, daddy's girl
I think I need to get me one and your one looks just right for me
Isn't it funny, how money can make a lot of people change?
Freakin', my friend, but I telling you, you wait

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

I remember once upon a time when I was just thirteen
So innocent and giving, everyone would act like they love me
Then all the *** and rumors began, seemed like I didn't have any friends
So much hate, lies and deceit caused by all that jealousy

Now do you *** really think that I'm the same girl I used to be?
Do you really think I will back down from you ***
If you try to bring it to me?

I know you're hating 'cause your man keeps watching
But I don't even want him, so tell him stop clocking
The more you hate I get closer to my goal
You'll wake up as nothing at twenty years old

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

Yeah, I remember them days when I didn't have no rhymes
Practicing my verse in the class 'til it was home time
I never used to pay attention in school
Was playing penny up the wall or in detention with fools

That's why most the teachers used to doubt me
They used to say I wouldn't make in my music just to see me get rowdy
So I could switch in the classroom for an excuse to kick me out
I wonder why I'm bunking all my lessons in the bathroom

Now I'm starving hungry, working hard for this super stardom life
Been kinda hard for me to try and make it right
And it's hard to decide, whether I should leave behind
All my peeps in this life, to move forward and seek what I find

This life is lethal like a *** baby being born addicted to the ***
So much evil in people, Dappy said it first
So I guess that I'm the sequel
So just because I'm black it don't mean that I can't be equal

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no

'Cause you went to the park with your friends
And let a shot off in the sky
I'm a 'G' 'cause if I go to this showroom
I don't have to ask for no discount for what ever I'm gonna buy

Chuck in the door, tell him I'ma see him in the nearby future
When I wanna never ride, got the whole country shoutin' na, na, nai
Just because you got one tune on the screen
Why you goin' round west with shades on your face
Fake chain on your neck posin' to be seen, you should get rush

I did 280 shows last year
I bagged seven bills every show that's rare
Imagine how my bank will look next year
I believe, I believe

I will defeat you, should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there asap

I will eat you, don't wanna *** with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me
I'm giving you to the count of 3, 2, 1

You believe, you believe
You can mention me like I haven't opened doors
I'm the reason, DJ's pay these kids
I'm done supportin' the cause

Hold up pause, how could you mention the best?
You ain't never seen no royalty checks
You will never go to places I went
Dawg, I'm moving up PRS

These kids better done with the indirects
Naw, you don't wanna see, I vex, I'ma lured to the mic
I hear you pray for my end, you can get stuffed

I got a bad boy album ready for the stores
MySpace views that, I will piss on yours
A face that the ladies like of course
I believe, I believe

I will defeat you, should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there asap

I will eat you, don't wanna *** with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me
I'm giving you to the count of 3, 2, 1

I remember the days we were poor
When five men would chip in for a Â£10 draw
That's Â£2 each when days were so raw
Now we're touring abroad and achieving awards

So if somebody was to take my freedom away I would hate that
Therefore if I got any problem, all I'd have to do is ring my guy
And he'll deal with it asap

When girls see me there like, ain't that the ha ha, girl?
You giving me a screw face and I, I'll show you what ha ha means
I'm not a trouble maker, but if you bring it to me I will break ya
I'm a little chick and not a ***
Young with a dream, I'm tryin' get rich

I will defeat you, should never mention me
If he comes on top and I ring a man
His reply will be like, don't worry I will be there asap

I will eat you, don't wanna *** with me
Don't get on the wrong side of me

I will defeat you, should never mention me

But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die, I ain't gonna lie now

Mama tried the best to bring me up right
Guess it never worked, she was cries
I was well involved in crime
From the age of nine music got me kind of famous
Now they want a piece of pie

Blud I'm blowin' up the scene but I don't no where my bed is
I smoke so much weed 'cause I don't no where my head is
I might have fame, but I'm still low on credit
Management loved the money, someone tell me where my bread is

I come across a lot of rich kids that die to be thugs
But I don't understand them they very, very loved
They don't wake up in the morning to see man pipin' dubs
You have to worry about them goons with the 38 snubs

You got too much to lose, you're in a great position
How can you be hood
If my whole freakin' flat is smaller than your kitchen
You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from, you'd go missing
So appreciate what you've got 'cause with that I'm still wishing

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum

You should never ask me why I smoke till my lips split
They always send me to try to stop movin' like a criminal is what I try

But you live by the roads, by the roadside you die
In every situation make man humble like pie
I've never had love for the feds 'cause they don't give man alibi
Holdin' man under arrest, takin' time outta my life

Once time's taken, time can't take back
We're from a place where it's [Incomprehensible]
Some real most idiots, mommy's tryin' hard we can see that
Once the road takes you east they won't be back

I get love on the road, I got feedback
I neva had it but I'm takin' the scene back
Then each others branging rubber of weed
Neva had it for, for a long, trust they need that
Push your hand up in the air, recognize that

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die, 'til the day that I die

Na, na, nye, how's your day?
What you want? Sayin' more
I'm in the studez making moves
I'm on the road moving food
Either way we're makin' paper
Makin' paper, DAP's, I'm Mista Baker

You won't get us on your stage unless it's five 5 bills or over
Knockin' doors till I you see us like a witness from Jehovah
So where's the bitch Lola, I should've brought her over
So she can suck the whole, [Incomprehensible]

All my mad men are dark, they're on east like the sharks
They in so much different shit, the pain would never leave my heart
I'll make you piss your pants like gettin' stuck with food in your car
So I suggest you listen close, trust me you could be a star

So what do you think? Do you still wanna live like me and him?
You make me sick, you talk gun talk, you ain't even seen a stick
Don't be upset, why do you have to cry?
Na, na, nye 'til the day that we die

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die

I'm afraid it's all you getting is good night, God bless
And when you wake up in the mornin' try not to be stressed
I wish I had what you had, I ain't got, no my life's a mess
So be thankful for your situation, stop actin' like a pest

I'm afraid it's all you getting is good night, God bless
And when you wake up in the mornin' try not to be stressed
I wish I had what you had, I ain't got, no my life's a mess
So be thankful for your situation, stop actin' like a pest

What we share was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

Six thirty in the morning, I've arrived early from tour
Step into the house, I'm walking up the stairs
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4

I'm on the second floor, I'm opening the door
I could not brace myself for what I saw
Who's this woman in my bed, name's Shaniqua and what?
Na, get the hell up off my baby

Now she the type of lady that every man needs
She's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna *** things by sex

There's some other hoe in our bed
What are you take me for?
To hell with you, to hell with me
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like, ouch

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
I think it's time for me to go

Semi brown skin beauty had to get it back
I understand she's upset, she wants to kick and slap
But you say I'm from the slum I wouldn't never stand for that, think
Underneath the bridge with that fake looking twat

Now remember when we were financially unstable
Channel 1 to 5, no Sky or cable
Had to do some dirty work in order to be able
To take care of you and put food on the table

Actions speak louder then words, I can't blame her for wanting the worse
She might be wishing that I'm dead, but I know she don't mean it
Think when I found those Nike's, I couldn't believe it

Remember when we had the feds knocking at our door
You took care of the stash and hid the money from the draw
You done the right thing 'cause they had me up on the floor
So you saved me from getting five years or more

Now she the type of lady that every man needs
She's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna *** things by sex

There's some other hoe in our bed
What are you take me for?
To hell with you, to hell with me
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a, ah
I think it's time for me to go

See how's we supposed to solve the situation?
When we're both as stubborn as each other
We would argue for hours over something dumb
What the ***? Conversation done

Our ego trips never help us get nowhere
You should know this by now
When you shout I smile, when you hit me I laugh
I get all cocky like, go run me a bath

So you wanna play it like that, but baby, I can get back
You don't wanna feel my, ouch, ouch, ouch
I've done it before, I'll do it again
Just leave me alone

Where the *** do you think you is going, going?
I loved you so much but you cheated on me

I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down
That shit right there is pricey
I ain't got no wifey

I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down

Are you set?
Back up, let me get that

Do you ever get horny reading a text?
You ever had sex over the Internet?
Webcam and shit wet up your tushy
Cut the story straight play with your pussy

All lovers put the plug in the socket like Bobby and Suzie
Wet up the place like a hot jacuzzi
I might come across sweet, really I'm a rudie

Ever since I started puberty
I was looking in magazines just to see the nudity
Truthfully, guess I don't care who you be, be

I'm fine if you take a chicks virginity
Looking at your phone becomes a misery
'Cause she calls you up more times than infinity

Bitch, let me be, I don't need no stress
I'd rather have a pint and a li'l bit sex
Who you think I am? I ain't buying you a dress
That's candy floss and I ain't here to impress

Sex no text, root it then boot it, shag that back
Fuck all the kissing and cuddling
Why don't you grab my balls and try juggling

Josh slept with Bianca
Little did she know he was wanker
'Cause he was a bi-sexual prick
He love slits as well as dicks

He fucked Bianca as hard as Rick
Never thinking of takin' a trip to the clinic
Now they're all in it, they might have AIDS
I can't have babes

At the end of the day
Josh should've put on his hood before the rain
You know what I'm sayin', anyway washin' in
Remember me, hey you know how I like it darlin'

Sex no text, root it then boot it, shag that back
Fuck all the kissing and cuddling
Why don't you put my knob in your mouth and try swallowing

Sex is a crazy thing
Especially if you do it with someone that you don't know
There's nothing wrong with a one night stand
Just watch your possession if she's a ho though

If you only knew what some females have put me through
Last week, I chased by a beast
Licking her lips like I'm some feast

I was drunk, my eyes were red
I'm kinda known so I wanted some head
Somehow we ended up in a bed
Little did I know she dreds on her legs and a wig on her head

I ain't gonna lie, I was scared
Bit fat mama came all prepared
'Bout which color condom would I like
Get the fuck off me, ooh

I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash

Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down
That shit right there is pricey
I ain't got no wifey

I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece

Na, na, nai

One day I had to punch up this one youth for trying to make a fool of me
In my hood there's only so many opportunities
Look I carry a tool for my pride and my jewelry
Now I find myself stuck serving the community

See me I made a change, I didn't expect no fame
We came from practically nothing to thousands screaming our name
A-list, play list, even my mum's famous
I would do anything for some source of stadium status

See the thing about life is that it's, it's just too short
Leave the past behind, and only then you'll find
There's more to life than you first thought

Cause I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that it would ever get better
Cause I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that it would ever get better

See I, I never ever, ever, ever
Thought that I could face this weather
But life, it will only get better
Trust me, it will only get better

Na, na, nai

Going back to when I was young
And I, treated life like it would never end
But then I grew up, got a little clued up
Then N-Dubz blew up finally on my way

Cause if you knew where I come from
You would understand why I sing this song
It's all changa, yeah, I put my hand up
In fact it made me man up and finally make a change

See the thing about life is that it's, it's just too short
Leave the past behind, and only then you'll find

Didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this
Ever wanna sing this song again

And I, and I don't wanna walk this road again
And I don't have to be alone again
I can hold my head high, I'm strong again
I'm strong again

Money made no change, in fact it was more pain
Be's gone, who's to blame?
Look at all these youths today, rollin' round with 38s
Stickin' brothas for the white gold chains like
Look I didn't mean to hurt you mate

Back in the day I used to roll with like thirty mates
Never had clean money, always had dirty plates
Be it now, we're grindin' an' washin' for like thirty days
Now we make [?]

Said Boy I've been seeing you for quite a while
And I needa confess express what you do to me
I need to tell you
About the way you've changed my life
So many beautiful nights your the reason 
You've got me staying ha ha through the night
See the thing is

I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say (straight up)
Can you make it clearer'
And I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind (well they do have a point)
Shut up!

All I'm tryin' got say is that
Wouldn't you wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself

Lose all that I have got for you

I like when you wear them material things
But I like it more when you try my hat on with the strings
And do the impression on me when I say na na nai
I ain't gonna lie no more you must have done a lot
For the body and the back and the brain that you've got
It's simple if I start I won't stop
You're so intelligent with such a high IQ
So if I ever have a baby id love it to be with you

The way she smiles at me every time she sees me its crazy
I'm proud to call her my lady
Like daps said, she the type of I girl I wanna see holding my baby
And she don't get excited whenever my job pays me
But if I'm on the phone she don't act right
So I try to keep them well away
So I don't have to stop a cat fight
Can't say I never said I wasn't that type 
Truly you really confuse me
And that's why

I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say (are you mad as)
Can you make it clearer'
And I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind (you must be blind)(i don't understand)

Got no money in the bank just stuck in a council estate '

Man up, producer, artist, MC
Killer everytime I go to pick a mike up frank
There's already true rider
We will talk billers
If you listen to my new album
When there's no thrillers
Gota N-dubz be cool chiller
Mum said stay away from the goldiggers
But I ain't gonna lie
I like sharing the chee and like staring and none of us are caring
Sex after dinner
I'm a wheeler dealer
Hash brown and wine T-shirts, 9 tracksuit with the black Fila
I didn't never wanna follow others I'm a leader
Say I was a fool but I am a good reader
Catch a couple haters call me a cheater
Got a couple of fans and now I don't need ya, naii
Its only right I'm wearing my Rolex, hello standard procedure

Bun your cheap talk (pop pop)
Who do you think I am
See me me me I'm on a mad ting

But now I'm in the Beamer one series turbs
Money, money makes the world go round
The same way the money makes the girls go down
Blatantly killing dem
No more paying man hundred pounds straight ten grand minimum

My car, my house my bills,
These fuckers know the deal,
Cause they're all paid by me (tell me T)
I got my own money, and I
Ain't looking for no footballers
So if you want to bring it too me,
Let's take it back
I will defeat you

One day it's gonna be over
I can see the end of the tunnel it's gettin' closer
I remember I was seven and feeling like I was older
Seeing things I shouldn't have and quickly became a grown up
All we wanted was money but we never seemed to get it
One minute remainin', there was never any credit
Here we are, ten years down the line nothin's changed
My aim is to put my mortgage down but in my mother's name

When you're hopin'
And the only thing you're lookin' forward to is your travel and your claimin'
There's somethin' called recession keeps messin' with your brain
When I left to see the sun come, here it's always fuckin' rainin'
When you're holdin, and you're dreamin' and you can't feel what you're feelin'
When you can't give, 'cause you're hurting and it seems like nothin's working

No one knows your name
No no one knows your name
Can't keep fighting
Something that's to change
Don't need a helping hand
Till no one understands
However this ends
Hand in hand we'll remain

I remain strong always
The only change I see is only death strain and more pain
We can't get no jobs but regardless we're tryin all day
Make sure you carry on going till everyone knows your name
To all the single baby mothers, it's gon' be alright
To all the men there, who be hustlin' every night
When the revolution comes and going, dressed up as a soldier
Put my arm and run and I won't sleep until it's over
Let me show ya

When you're holdin'
And the only thing you're lookin' forward to is for someone to start blamin'
'Cause what they tell us on the news is highly entertainin'
When I left to see the sun 'cause here it's always fuckin' rainin'
When you're holdin, and you're dreamin' and you can't feel what you're feelin'
When you can't give, 'cause you're hurting and it seems like nothin's working

No one knows your name
No no one knows your name
Can't keep fighting
Something that's to change
Don't need a helping hand
Till no one understands
However this ends
Hand in hand we'll remain

This is more than a dream
Though it's further then we see
I know we'll get there
I slow down, I will get weak
I can't stand and I can't reach
Everything we need is closer than it seems

I slow down, I will get weak
I can't stand and I can't reach
Everything we need is closer than it seems

No one knows your name
No no one knows your name

N-Dubz,"I don't slip or trip when she asks me where I've been (Where you been)
One big smile on my face zip it darling it's just you and me (You and me)
Now I'm on some Alfie behaviour, I'll call you back later
Too many fish in the sea for me
But when the lights come on, and what's her name is gone
I realise where I'm supposed to be

I tried to believe every word of your sweet story
But intuition keeps telling me
You're making a fool outta me

'Cause I'm such a good liar
Just admit it (I never did it)
Yes you did it (No I didn't)
Ay
I'm playing with fire
Just admit it (I never did it)
I know you did it (No I didn't)

I can't help myself, I keep playing with fire

Thoughts running right through the night as I watch you sleep
(She's gettin' closer)
I can't help but check his text, while he's passed out next to me
(It's only a matter of time)
I'm on some CSI behaviour, who's gonna save ya
You'll be the fool when the truth comes out
So when those lights come on, and what's her face is gone
We're straight back to the same routine

Living life in disguise, can't keep up with these lies
You do anything to try and catch me out, but I never leave no signs
In my heart we was meant to be
But guys like me be like two or three
I can't help myself I love girls, I can't kick out playing with fire

I can't kick out playing with fire

You were number one then
But I don't feel the same no more
I just want you as a friend
I'm done trying to pretend
They say good things don't last forever
Someday they gotta end
And a matter of fact
I'm doing you a favor
If done of fuckin' girls
And coming back to you later
And I'm sick of deleting everything in my pager,
Baby I'm not Britney
But I'm dropping of ya' radar
She wonders why I never pick up my phone,
Cos all I'm trying to do is keep it on the low.
I think I need to let her know before she finds out on her own,
Either way I'm going to break her heart when I tell her go.
All my ppl round the world if you like somebody else,
How do you find the words to say its over?
I been wanting to tell you,
But I dunno how to tell you.
How do you find the words to tell them its over?
Baby its killing me
This just isn't right for me,
I think I like somebody else.
I ain't gunna lie
But you were number one
But it just ain't the same anymore
Your out of my top ten
This ain't good for your health
And only if you knew
That every time I'm fuckin' you
I think of somebody else.
I knew one of us was gonna get hurt
From the get go I told you I told you I said so
I hate having to fake the feeling
Every time we get low,
I think its better for us both
If we let go
She wonders why I'm never round these days,
As soon as I touch base
She'll be all up in my face
Its the same old **** she never gives me any space,
How do I tell her someones taking her place?
All my people around the world if you like somebody else,
How do you find the words to say its over?
I been wanting to tell you,
But I dunno what to tell you.
How do you find the words to tell them its over?
Baby its killing me this just isn't right for me,
I think I like somebody else.
Why should I feel guilty?
Its plain to see I ain't being myself
Is it wrong if I want it from someone else?
Cos I've been holding on for so long now,
Why do I feel guilty?
Just plain to see I ain't being myself.
Is it wrong if I want it from somewhere else?
Ive been holding on for so long
Cant, take, no, more, I wont pretend another day,
I think its time for me to say exactly how I feel
Cant, take, no, more,
I just ain't happy anymore
Cant keep lying to myself
How do you find the words to say that its over?

But I dunno what to tell you

I ain't gonna lie I'm always behind when you get on all fours

Instead of doin somethin good with my life

We all used to shot food but it was more about who was the gulliest in the ends
Shout out to Tinchy, I was smaller than my guns
One thing we wouldn't do and that was shot a mans mum
But I wass jammed up at the crack house, all night long

Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called ""Don't Go""
Now its just you and me on a love row

Dappy like dino us two tip toes duck dive get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now we're deep in way past intro dappy explain yo

See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You're number one

See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a thing before now, you're the one
See all I did was blink twice, from my homie to my only
Number one

Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh

Yo
It was all now never planned no after
It was like games jokes laughter
Live for the moment, left it all open
Now I'm in deep, flames, lava, breathe, karma

And now I'm stating, see I never saw this in my daydream
Its really you that I'm fully rating
And the days here no more waiting

Pay it all wise to the smart man raised him
I was so hurt, pain, aching
On the wrong path then a good girl saved him
That's why I'm letting man know she's amazing

See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You're number one

See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a fling before now, you're the one
See all I did was blink twice from my homie to my only
Number one

You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Ill never let nothing get in the way

You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way

Yo, I ain't never gonna let nothing get in the way
You play your cards all right you're an Ace
You make my nights so bright you're my days
You took me out of the maze
You are number one

See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a thing before now, you're the one
See all I did was blink twice from my homie to my only

From when I was younger my pain was driven by hunger
No one could tell me nuttin to save me from goin under
Mama cried to me told me you
Should get your grave dug up
The way you act in the winter you wont be here by the summer
When my papa was alive I'd never listen
See now if I could switch places wiv him just to show him I miss him
All the plans were dicussed in the kitchen
Might aswell.
The way we were on a mission
Life is a biatch until u marry one
Have a kid or 2 then u carry on
Whether you work 9-5
Or u carry guns you only live onve
So make sure you get to have some fun
Now when we in the clubs we party like we own em
Whoever thought I couldnt make it
Time has come to show em
Been a struggle all my life
But now the doors are finally open

Always hated life at home
Money came in slow, getting high, runnin wild
Thought it was all I'll ever know
Me and mum up in the council flat
I had to save us one bedroom between the both of us werent exactly spacious
Never had a lot of dough, I ment no dough
Only little bit off cash I made was if I did a show
Even then I'd get booed off the stage
Collect my doe and go
I would always try my luck, but I was real unlucky though
Never met a man that thinks with his dick
Never give me my own statistic
90% of all men are pricks
So from the day I was born I was stuck in the shit
That's why, your never gonna see me cry
'Cause I'm no longer in the shit
Bitch I am the shit
That's why
I live for the mother fuckin' moment

I would never sell my soul for the P

You always want to but you never let me know
You've seen my video, I'm on the radio
And now it's all about me
But when I step to you
You step away from me
Remember how you played

Girl you said you wasn't feelin' me
You were never callin' me
Never used to ring my phone
Now you tell your friends that you know me
Say that we talk frequently

Girl I'm still the same guy that you think is a star
And now you're all alone

It's funny how you change
Now you want to step to me
But I ain't the one
You had your chance to be with me
So I gotta let you know, hear me on the radio
Or see me on your tv
'cause when I stepped to you
You stepped away from me
Now you're the one who's lonely

He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding

If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so, tell me so baby

Come on honey let's spend the night together

All we need is some love, some love 
That's all we need 
That's all we need 

I just can't forget, how did I feel no regret 
When I think of all the things I've done 
Then a tear will fall, makes mg life seem very small 
Looking down the barrel of a gun. Why is it our nature to kill? 
We always have, we always will 
Find a wag for life to survive, only faith can keep us alive 
Out of the dark and in to the light, a new beginning is in sight 
Now it?s time to follow mg lead, just a little trust is what we need. 

Now here comes the love daddy '0' with ma sugar flow leave da world alone 
Give the young ones a chance to grow up, a drink from the fountains of love, 
All wars will end, all colours should blend. 
Coz I be the same as you be but when someone sees me, 
Even though I'm raw I'm still humanity and it don't matter what ya use to, 
We are the world and we be da future.",That's All We Need,1996

Is it a vision of high technology. 
Heartbeat gettin' faster. 
Disobey the order of your master. 
No command you, no heart and soul.

Mad skills on the rise again
With the summer time rhyme solos out there's miles again
I'm hittin' on the down low
With something for the beach or ya jeep or ya condo
The summertime's here girls in bikinis with their sun tan glow and I don't care
As far as the eye can see
There's a hundred beach bunnies on the beach and they're jockin me
Now that's the lick and it's a pity
That you and yours ain't loungin in the city

Do ya wanna go down , Do ya wanna go down with me
If ya ready come and take me now
Come and rock me in the city

The sea feels cool and when I'm dried off you know it's over to the barbecue
The party starts at noon but it's a beach thing and I'm holding more ass than a G-string
Just blazing up I'm getting hot from the rays and the force of my paper cut
Just coolin with my peeps beach bunnies showing out from the waist to the back seat
The summer fest year after year I'm in the sun and my body's feelin blessed
Maxin and relaxin a little one on one coz all the ladies love my vaccine

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax, baby. Now we're all alone

They wake at dawn, 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining
They got each other. Neither one's complaining
He says, I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar. We can watch the early movie

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me

N-Trance,"Oooooh-eeee-yeeaaaahh 
Oooooh-woah-ohhwooohh 

Verse1 
I remember when the skies were blue 
All I wanted was to be with you 
Now the days are dark and I'm alone 
Dreaming of the place I call my home 

Chorus 
Hold me now , in your arms 
the love I lost , you never found 
I close my eyes , and think of you 
alone again , tears in the rain 

Verse2 
The day you stole my heart it felt so true 
When you threw it back it broke in two 
Until the storm inside me fades away 
I'll be waiting for a brighter day

(Oh, yeah!) 

Do you feel the energy inside your body ? (Oh, yeah) 
Can you feel the music, oh don't ever lose it (Yeeeeeah) 

Turn up the power everybody 
Turn up the power (uh uh) and dance with me 
Turn up the power everywhere 
Turn up the power. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

Throw the switch, start it up 
I made you move now you come unstuck 
You're pullin' the levers, watching them dials 
The time has come for the madman's smiles 
Activated, generated 
Breathin' life in the mind he created 
Knockin' you back with a beat you can't stop 
Gonna rock, gonna rock 'til you drop 
I'm the taker, you're the maker 
Like a T-1-K I'm the new terminator 
They came down to belong to the sound 
Keep the S. L. spin, spinning 'round and around 
Another question without an answer 
Who created the ultimate dancer 
Energy for you to devour. 
Yeah, turn up the power 

(Oh, yeah) 
Do you feel emotion singing with devotion (Oh, yeah) 
Can you feel the pressure always gonna getcha (Yeeeeeah) 

In demanding, I'm commanding 
Once you summer fall lead you understanding 
Don't hesitate 'cause I know what you mean 
You dance to the rhythm of another machine 
Look in my eyes, they hypnotize 
A logical brain the lives and never lies 
Made by man, destroyed by the enemy 
Is it a vision of high technology 
Heartbeat gettin' faster 
Disobey the order of your master 
No command you, no heart and soul 
Have I lost my grip, am I losing control 
Malfunction, mass corruption 
All in all, a countdown to destruction 
Set your body in a final hour. 
Yeah, turn up the power 

Do you feel the energy inside your body. Oh, yeah 
Can you feel the music, oh don't ever lose it. Oh, yeah 
Do you feel emotion singing with devotion. Oh, yeah 
Can you feel the pressure, always gonna getcha. Yeah",Turn Up the Power [Radio Edit],2002
N-Trance,"Oh yeah

When I hold you baby
Feel your heart beat close to me
Wanna stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free

When I wake each morning
And the storm beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free

set you free x4
Oh yeah

When we touch each other
In the state of ecstasy
Want this night to last forever
Only love can set you free

Set you free x 4

N-Trance,"The summer sun is fading as the year grows old
And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn
'Cause you're not here!",Forever Autumn,2006
