The Fall,"When I'm walking down the street,
It's always you I seem to meet,
Long hair down and sneakers on your feet.
And write your letters to the Evening News
I clench my fist and sing this tune:

I said Hey student, hey student, hey student,
You're gonna get it through the head,
I said Hey student, hey student, hey student,
You're gonna get it through the head, I said...

When walking to work,
It's always you I seem to meet
Henna in your hair, standing in the heat
As you serve us in [motor bows] a book kid
I clench my hand before I flip my lid.

When walking down the street,
It's always you I seem to meet,
Long hair down and sneakers on your feet.
As you listen to Pearl Jam in your room.
I'm thinking like that when I sing this song:

I said I woka-to-ma, woka-to-ma
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah

When walking down the street,
It's always you I seem to meet,
Long hair down and sneakers on your feet.
As you stare in your room at Shaun Ryder's face
Down long long long long days

I said I woka-to-ma, woka-to-ma
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah

The dead brains of class A-D
Born to live in Leigh-on-Sea
Twin swastikas, court, swimming pool
I'm thinking like this when I sing this tune:

I said I woka-to-ma, woka-to-ma
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah
Woka-to-ma, wah wah wah

The Fall,"You'll never see me trying to raise Cain
You'll never see me wear a suit of green
There's a slip-road up right ahead
Leading to the agragarian
But I'm city born and bred
Too many car-fumes in my head
Just a well-read punk peasant.

But you'd think a country man would understand
The devil makes work for idle hands.
M5 6-7 pm

And the man who pretends he knows it all
Is destined to a Mighty Fall.
Gets into your house with cheer,
Then proceeds to take all you've got to offer.
This is not an autobahn
It's an evil roundabout
That leads to the Haywain
And you'll never see good trains again.

In late 60s, my daddy said to me,
You'll never see trams and clogs again.
Now they roam the city.

Can these people not understand
The devil makes work for idle hands
M5 6-7 pm
The devil makes work for idle hands.

M5 to the country straight ahead
It's stuffed to the gills with crusty brown bread
Can they not understand
There's nothing worse than a bored man?

[...] 
Oh right yeah. Okay go on, tell us all about it 
Well I mean the first half we were all over them. It's a typical City game, why'know. Ye were like totally outplayed, and they're rubbish anyway, West Ham, it's got to be said. [.. .] but erm no we were all over them in the first half and I don't know what he puts in the tea in the second half but erm we were like kinda zombies when we came back on. There weren't any good players apart from er Rocastle which I thought was 
that one little thing where he sort of... 
...... 
Yeah we do we play lots of football, loads of passing, they play too much football, they're just kind of er. . . everyone's like looking for a passing opportunity rather than like a scoring opportunity. 
Not going to go down though, are they, Craig? 
Er.. .I don't know. Everyone else in er. .. everyone else thinks we're gonna go down but they've just like suddenly come out of closets, why'know, they've like discovered their grandfather was a United fanfar. 
Right 
...some years back It's like the whole of Manchester at the moment anyway 
I was told you see, I was always told er the conventional wisdom was that ....  that isn't the case any more.

They were under Irish patronage.
We shot dead a stupid sergeant,
but I got hit in the crossfire.
The lucky hit made me hit a time lock.

But, when I got back.
The place I made the purchase, no longer exists
I'd erased it under the bridge.

Day by day.
The moon came towards me
By such things.
The moon came towards me.

So now I sleep in ditches.
And hide away from nosey kids.
The wings rot and feather under me.
The wings rot and curl right under me.
A small alteration of the past.
Can turn time into space.
Small touches can alter more than a mere decade.

And that it never rains, it just pours...

So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese

In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole

And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew

Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'

But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin', I'm clappin' your way

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective

For the ones who love you so

Instead of being with those who love you,
You spend time apart, it's because you think
They won't understand
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your
Hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you.

Countries' borders were right out of sight
When they joined together and decided not to fight

You can find someone who's got it worse
All the things you take for granted now
They started out as blessings first
If you got someone who loves you
And a steady job that puts food on the table
If you're strong and able
Man, be grateful

The Fat Boys,"In Jail
In jail
Unh-unh
Unh-unh

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

Now there was just one day
That I will never forget
I got jailed for something that
I'll always regret

It was twelve o'clock, midnight
And I wanted a snack
So I headed downstairs
Thought the fridge was packed
But when I opened the door
What did I see?
The back of the fridge staring right at me
I thought to myself
I could almost die
Then an image appeared
A pizza pie

So I put on Adidas
Headed out the door
As I pictured myself
Eating more and more
But the store was closed
I busted into a rage
So I went to the crib
And got my twelve-gauge
Ran back to the shop
Busted won the door
And all I saw
Was pizza galore

So I stuffed my face
I couldn't even walk
I couldn't laugh, smile
Shake, giggle, wiggle, or talk
So I fell asleep with my face in my plate
And the next thing you know
I was headed upstate

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

Well, Kool Rock is my name
Last part is ""ski""
And I have the worst
Case of my M.C
But listen to the story
Cause it's kind of strange
When I had this sort of hunger pain
Walking down the strreet
With the bass of my box
With my stomach growling
Like a hungry fox
When I saw this scene
Or was it a dream?
A big restaurant sign
Called Burger King
So I went inside
Started stuffing my face
Didn't even think
About the things I ate
But when the bill came up
Boy, was I shocked
I said, ""I don't pay for nothing
I'm the King of the Slops!""

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

But when our time is through
We'll rock you and you
We turn parties out
Make you scream and shout
We're not demanding
Or very outstanding
We got something unique
And in the middle he's standing
On the microphone
He rocks and shocks
Homeboys and girls
It's the Human Beat Box

Break

Now I'm sitting here alone
Looking at the wall
Just thinking about
How I took the fall
I thought I was cool
I thought I was slick
And now Im writing
Letters of being homesick
I lost my freedom
When I heard the door slammer
And now I'm breaking rocks
With a big, heavy hammer
I used to drive the streets
With my big car
And now I look and all
I see are bars
I jail
Everyone's the same
You only survive
If you play the game
You don't have guns
And now you remember
You're your momma's son
You made her cry
And stay up all night
Coming home high
Just leaving a fight
You always made her feel
That you were better
But now you're a little boy
Just waiting for a letter",Human Beat Box [Disco 3],1997

Speak once again of my love, my own.

And this ribbon spinning and computer color

I'd like to tell you a story, kids
But instead I'll change the subject
Listen to this tune, it sounds like a condolence card
Bought at the last minute for someone you can't stand
For someone you never liked
And isn't it cute

La la la

Listen to this tune I'm playing now, kids
Does it seem sad?
Does it remind you of when?",The Garfield El,2005
The Fiery Furnaces,"""Well, good for you.
But we have something too.""
So said my aunt.

A bowling alley and lunch counter
Filled with fellas on their lunch break,
From the Western Electric plant at a slant across the street.
And next door when So-and-So's men would come in, and the man himself very often.

It was guns under the counter every time.
Guns under the counter every time.
Guns under the counter every time,
And bowling on the second floor.

Very often he was there himself,
And I, of course, had a special small ball as a little girl,
And didn't I grow up, didn't I grow up to be captain of the Morton girls bowling team? 
I did!
Though I don't attach much importance to that now, or then,
Then riding the old Garfield El downtown,
And on up to State Street,
And back to guns under the counter,
Guns under the counter every time.
Guns under the counter,
And bowling on the second floor.

I never liked Douglas park,
And no one likes it now,
But that's neither here nor there. (There, or here.)
West of Crawford, where it is I stayed,
Chicago straights alliterates. (North, and south.)
I lived in the Ms.
But it was down on the south side,
Dr. Peter Pane and his brother had their doughnut factory.
And I mention it now because...

That one day (Now I wasn't there, We were in Davenport at that time),
Some north side Irish bullets came zipping through that window.
In Cicero,
Never stand at a window!
And past the counter,
Looking for those men,
Who had their guns behind the counter,
And you could smell the boiled cabbage on those bullets!
One of them managed to hit a young pinsetter in the leg;
Wouldn't you know it.
But luckily Panagoulis
Dr. Peter Pane
Was there to see to it.
He took some special blackberry filling right out of his lunch bag
And applied it to the young man's wound.
You see, Dr. Peter Pane was an interesting man,
And an even more interesting doctor,
As he would use no material or remedy
That wasn't used in the manufacture of his doughnuts,
Down on 82nd and Kedzie with his brother.
But he tempered this by the fact that he would rarely use ingredients that didn't have some medicinal purpose.
Or so he thought.

Here in the doughnut factory,
They have confectioner's sugar
So sweet it was caustic.
And chocolate so bitter that it could kill typhus!
Glazing so shiny,
It could set back glaucoma.
And filling so filling,
You didn't need stitches!
The same special blackberry filling that was applied to the young man's wound.
Blackberry filling that came straight from Dr. Peter Pane's lunch bag.

We were in Davenport,
With a big restaurant downtown,
And I once kept a jackrabbit in the back yard,
And I'd walk across the river to Rock Island,
To Greek school,
On a fine fall day.
And I'd look up at the sky
And down at the river.
But Davenport changed its name to Hooverville,
So to speak,
And we had to go to Chicago to move in with my aunt.",Guns Under the Counter,2005
The Fiery Furnaces,"But there was one other man with whom I didn't get along.

The Bishop
would head down, head down to Deerport Station,
to see what stars on the silver screen might be seen,
or Broadway stage were all the rage,
with his black leather autograph book,
and his black leather pastoral pumps,
and his pressed black robes,
and his tidy black beard of which he was so proud,
and his hat that stuck out in a crowd.
But there he'd sit,
at his table at the Edgewater Hotel,
wearing his ecclesiastical furs,
and lunching with two giggly and none too healthy looking young men,
and in his shirt pocket up close to his heart was his autographed picture of Robert Mitchum,
which he no doubt used in an impure way.

And I was at home rehearsing my choir.

On Christmas day,
in the afternoon,
I got a call at home.
The Bishop was on the phone,
wanting the choir to go and sing
on some Channel 44 thing.

And I said ""Out of the question!
The rest of the day is for their families!""
And the Bishop became furious:
all that time singing Western music,
Christmas carols, backsliding,
and no time to represent the diocese!
But of course he was just upset because he wanted to be on the show,
and he hated women.

And I knew he was angry with me,
but I couldn't worry about it.
I went about my business,
rehearsing my choir.
Rehearsing my choir.

(Da da da da da da da)
Again!
(Da da da da da da da)
Ugh, altos, out of tune!

(Da da da da da da da)
That's not good!
(Da da da da da da da)
That sounds horrible.

Next Sunday was my late sister's Namesday.
La la la.

And the Bishop was coming that day to our church to deliver a sermon,
which would give me quite a big surprise.

""Decadence in the church!
Betrayal of our traditions!
Look up in the shoir loft, for instance, the lady in red:
Eva!
I ban her from receiving communion,
and remove her as choir director!""

I couldn't believe my ears.
And the congregation couldn't believe theirs.
And my husband was furious when he was told, as he wasn't there at the time,
and letters were written and phone calls were placed,
and the matter was taken up, and I was granted an audience.

And I sat there nervous and frightened,
when into the room
stepped His Eminence,
the Archbishop.

They had a strange deliberating process at his initiative,
as it was his prerogative alone.
But the Hierarch with the tallest hat and longest beard would stand in the middle,
and the prelates with shorter hats and beards radiated out,
with the Archbishop in front of them,
and then they began to intone.
And I was left on the other side of the door, alone.

And when they came out, Bishop Nikolaki was sent to San Jose.",Rehearsing My Choir,2005

Though let's be fair

Other sweethearts
Tom Kitsos, for instance
And another I won't mention

I loved him truly, or so I thought
Turned out in another snare he'd been caught

They were to get married that June
And all the relatives
From New Hampshire and Harrisburg, were coming
And the day I heard, I went home
And closed the door to my room
And I laid down on my bed
And I may have cried
Very briefly

I watched and wondered if they would last
I tried to tell myself ""put it in the past,""

And that June
As I was the organist at our church, didn't you know
I was up in the choir loft, looking down
On all their friends and relations
Playing as they walked down the aisle

I'd see him 'round some
We'd nod and smile
I couldn't decide if I was still in love with him
After all this while

I'd see them together at church
And they'd look sort of grim

Black marks off charcoal from the dune: remember?
I thought it wouldn't be too soon; we'd wait at least until its June.
The twenty-ninth of March it rained: remember?
You looked so sad that I explained: remember?
You knew it wouldn't be too soon; we'll have to wait until its June.
I've been waiting since I don't know when and now it finally seems about to start.
I swear, I swear, that I will do my part.
December dark at six o'clock: remember?
The freezing wind gives you a shock: remember?
You knew it wouldn't be too soon; we'll have to wait until its June.
October damp on down the street: remember?
The sodden leaves stuck to your feet: remember?

Across against the light and the sleet scalds my sight, stunned I stayed put and a billboard truck runs over my foot. So things are really hopping; and my unemployment's stopping; and my kitty cat's copping; and I need to forget. So I go to the window and smell a cigarette.

Now I'm in the clutches of my crutches: I'm laid up, and I sip from my cup, and I look outside. And I see Christopher Hyde-who just got divorced, and there's a restraining order enforced-going in his ex-wife's garage. I'm just drunk enough to open the window, yell out gruff:

â??Don't you key that brand-new Camry.â?? And he gave me the cursor, â??Damn,â?? returning to the spot he was, â??Mind your own business you!â?? And I wag my finger, â??You're not doing what you're supposed to do.â??

And then he's coming toward me, and I took a swig of my tequila 'cause it made me feel a little nervous as he started across against the light: but he didn't look to his right as he didn't stay put. And a billboard truck came and ran over his foot.

And the cops responding called out to me, â??Hey is this your cat?â?? â??Yeah, but sometimes it forgets. Ah, wait a minute. I gonna come out there and smell a couple a cigarettes.â??

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed"".
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.

As I try to fill all of my empty days
I stumble round on through my memory's maze
Of all my past, only the sadness stays

I was moping down by the bridge
I rode a bike in the snow to the mini-mart
I thought of the ways that I've broke my own heart

It's not for me to fill the blue sea with tears
But when I think back on all the wasted years
All the good cheer and all of the charm disappears

I wore the exact same clothes for five days
The bailbondsman gave me a smile
I was just thinking of only my sins all the while

I stumble round on through my memory's maze

String up silk your tiger bow

I was so bored with my old life
I was so bored with decent odds

My new roommate left her debit card
Some sort of test for me. It's too hard
Try to run an errand. Nervous sweat
I rush back home and if I win I'll give her half
I bet
Online casino in the caymans
Legal disclaimer writ for layman's

I moved back into new canaan
Babysit my sister's kids; its rainin'
They fuss a bit while I put them to bed
And grumpy, sitting on the couch, I get it in my head
Take metro north. A silver candlestick
To aquaduct on lirr. Pick

I was so bored with my new life
I felt like I knew all the odds

I bet 'gainst myself I wouldn't wager

I stole the deed one night when she was drunk
I drove onto the reservation with it in my trunk
Sensors beep the threshold when I crossed it
Thirty thousand marker soon I lost it

""let me tell you why I think I love her
She knows you always take the bye week dome home team to cover.""
Go up to pimlico and I choose
It's no fun if it's fine when you lose

I was so tired with all the angles
I was so bored with losin' easy

So I gambled on going further a-field
So I flew to sydney and then to bali and then to jakarta
And called on my step-father's ex-business partner
Major timmy sastrosatomo
And he set me up as a silver smith/batik dabber
In a house once owned by the princes of mataran.
And he told me all his troubles

We bribed a cfo at semen cibinong
To get them to buy a 40% stake
And we got a 5 million dollar order from nieman marcus,
Which we filled about 10%
But I did sell them my children's book
Which I said was a south sumatran
Folk tale--which went like this:

I played cards for seven days straight,
Was up $47 dollars late
Evening as the sun went down I saw
The ace of diamonds up his sleeve--black velvet on his paw.
I fold, say goodbye politely.
They bark, you don't get off that lightly

I dreamed of a casino way up in the hills of borneo
Where I lost with the giant flying squirrels and orangutans and great
Morman butterflies all day long.
'Til the bulldozers turned us into whole fruit fruit bar sticks and
China markers

An isolated old lady
A dignified dame who keeps her own counsel
In love with the out-of-the-way
Identifying with the unfamiliar
Contemptuously turns her back on the wicked world
With its vulgar delusions and correspondingly
Scorns its regard

Our lady alone
With her scarf over her head
And her pricey purse over her shoulder strap
Wonders up at the heavens
And for yesterday yearns
The days of old

Often, she surrounds herself with
Like-minded bluestockings
And together they regret the dear beloved
Simple folk struggle with their own confused
Concerns, still

But she puts her pity on pause
And withdrawn from the delicate
And uncorrupted by the crude
She resigns even her/ own
Designs-
Then all at once
Brings in a breath
Purses her purple
Her honey-black lips
And lets loose a high
And round and resonant
And glad and grave

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou,1967
The Fifth Estate,"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
As she was flying on her broom
For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
And thru the town the joyous news was spread
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead

The Fight,"

I'm moving out today, got to get away
I've got to find a place to settle down
I've had enough of this. I've got to find a place
Where people care for me and don't put me down
It might sound silly, but you're the cause of this
'Cause I can't take the way you run around
I must admit I've had my share of fun
But that's all over now it's time to run

Because you've got me
Running around in circles
I'm running around in circles
Running aroundâ??
I'm looking for you

I've been away now just over a year
And I must tell you, I can't settle down
I thought I'd write to you just to let you hear
About my story; don't put it down

Because you've got me
Running around in circles
I'm running around in circles
Running aroundâ??
I'm looking for you

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

The Film Studio Orchestra,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.","The Sound of Silence [From ""The Graduate""]",2003

Means your true lovin' daddy ain't coming back

You were flying too high for my little old sky so I'm movin' on

Said hello to the Southland we're coming to you
We're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free and I'm movin' on

I've got a pretty woman in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let the black smoke roll keep rollin' me on

I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
I'm movin' on I'm rollin' on
You broken your vow and it's all over now so I'm movin' on

But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue so keep movin' on

Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key

Bring a smile to an ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue light a philly cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Salute with chill Remy gently escort four ladies an arm
The four caesars at the club Pentleys condo sweets I'm fancy
20 floors up overlookin' ladies boomerang they panties
Bump the Firm Family's latest takin' trips to Las Dregas
That's how we do it Aftermath incorporated

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon it's the motherfuckin' Firm Family ooh
Yeah, I better pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming
Ooh cause the way you make me feel I feel like ooh screaming

I spit rhymes for the radio and spit for tours
Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now if you just wanna front, you know my styles tight
Niggas never should of plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tangeray 60 inch screen when we hang with Dre
I just flew in from Queens no bag and plan to stay
In the heat park this Royals Royce up in the beat
Seeing topless bitches rollerblading in the street

While I lounge in a jacuzzi sky cliff blue got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too, how we do?
Hit trees Cristal bottles, breeze tropical spread love till we wobble
It's time to give let the kids live comfortable
Anybody pumpin' between the East and West: fuck you
Make moves political hit this revenue
Set examples respect every individual

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon it's the motherfuckin' Firm Family ooh
Yeah, I better pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming
Ooh cause the way you make me feel I feel like ooh screaming",Firm Family,1997
The Firm,"Verse One: Nas Escobar, AZ the Vizuliza

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in the Firm
I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time
There were wise guys everywhere, we were around
Twenty one, twenty two at the time
Yeah every place we go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars just for keeping
The ice cold, yeah we were legends and we still are

Two hundred fallen angels, we balling from every angle
Heavy bag gold, panamania changed angle
Let's tangle, tabernacles
Ill lukiens coming at you, fuck Parus
A billion years B.C., originally black Jews
Cashsews honey now roasted, let's kill the colprate
He owe us shit, toe toe toe with that four four bit
Fuck the hoe shit, mercury back tax ?birth? for me
Personally I existed when Earth was in need, indeed
Human lifeform transformed from light storms, poltrons
Electrons nuetrons, iced long
Nights long, repltilaians I'll see ya'll in the next millennium
What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Caribbean
Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambiants, love fine carats and cars that launch
Nonchalaunt, usually there are Jimmies up in the palms
Play low style, Guteians change my whole profile
Left the dope pile, bet the guard be around for awhile
Firm Islamic, hit the croner of the Earth just like a comet

Verse Two: AZ the Vizuliza, Nas Escobar

See I like Esco, he knew everybody and everybody knew him
He was the type of guy who routed for the bad guys in the movies
But hey

Die for this Firm, live for this Firm
Niggas learn, never should come before your fam
From ki's to ported grams, these are corners in the blue van
E's upon on us, cause of warrants 
While we smoke hash cheese enormous, stack cheese
Travel the world like Taurus, went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camdon, we handlin' to D.C.
Chips on fights with China White's by they tight PP
Wanting PC but all they get is good dick or four clips
For loose lips, by the jungle flise
Suck the pearl tongue juices, off you fly misses
Take her out to the Spark's stakehouse, gentelmen style
Coincidental, family's here
Meet fem fatale, French connection
Persian wet don, let's get this ""F"" on
The Ebony queen, Fox you grab my left arm
Dre made a QB the conton, BK and so on
Family strong ???? Nature, make sure we all get this millionaire's paper
What a sweet site for sour eyes, may we rise
Hope for now on we never cross sides

Veres Three: Foxy Brown

You know what, most hoes would have left these cats a long time ago
I mean if your man gave you a gun to hide, what would ya'll hoes do?
But you know, the shit kinda turned me on

Black Madonna, hoes kill for they popals
Never seen a bitch like this, queen misses
Rock BDS's on the left wrists, trick check this
Respect this, Firm's niggas lie knee deep in this bitch
want to need bitch and have my pussy bleed, swear for 'em
Fuck and take the chair for 'em, whoever dare cross us
The thoughts that thoughts across a bitch's minds, pops the nine
Leave 'em resting in peices, while my thorough bitches peep this
Death before decid-a, screw me on the dick-a
Lace me in Gabanna, peep dat
Think I'm flippin' on these three cats, 
Set yo clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G's, stash the guns for 'em
And the icedy E Berkee, breathe the the sun for 'em
Long dick style, swallow the enemies cum for 'em
Pretty ass hoe, bitches fuck 'em and I dumb on 'em
When Nas pop the Crist, Fox cops the fifth
Make my doe up for OZ's, now hoes that's real uhhh",Firm Fiasco,1997
The Firm,"Five minutes to flush

Nature:
They say they just want to question me the interuption
4 in the morning they knocked and caught me fuckin'
Throw on something mad provocative play with the top lock
Buy me some time so I can hide the shit kinda quick
Move the guns clip the herb  
They got me shook up plus my nut was disturbed
Hide the chocolate pickin' up shells form off the carpet
Baracaiding the door for war like a hostage
It's my crib, got my name on the lease
Can't explain niggas just get arrained and released
But who snitched set me up, I think it's you bitch
Sacrificing my life for you two kids? 
Truth is, I got a business to lose eyewitness news 
Paper tellin' bitches to move, police turned this into a zoo
Mad reporters, I laugh as I'm sippin' my brew
They think they caught us

Hook:
4 in the morning Feds are out at the door
What you gonna do? 
What you gonna do when they come through for you?
Ooh ee ooh ee ooh ee yeah yeah yeah yeah
4 minutes left

Nature:
About a minute went by they knocked harder
My bitch went hysterical in shock
Slapped her to calm her
4-4 cocked to armor
It's been a long day now I raid with jakes playin' in the hallway
It's senseless, enter my crib and can't prevent this
Blockin' my enterence, trying to knock it off the hindges
Battering rams coming inches, my hoe was buggin'
Throw a fit thowin' puttin' coke in the oven
Like I'm Larry Davis the phone rang some D.A. bitch
""Nature turn yourself in"" I didn't say shit
Knowin' in my heart I'm a stay rich
It's abusing, confusing them until they lose patience
Try to ease up, calm my nerves with the cheeba
Hoping the door doesn't fall before the keys flush
Thieves rush, plus the riot squad
No surrender no retreat shit's deep but times is hard

Hook

Nature:
By the time they had busted in I had touched the cash
Just flushed the last hundred grams nigga subduct the math
They made me either that or let them take me
Still in my night clothes fake like I'm asleep
Spoke to my rat heard him ask where the coke at
Predicate felon hope to never go back
They had survelance aware of all dealings
Knew about bitches that liked to shoot and loot kept in ceilings
Searching my spot behind curtains stay cursing
Chief of police finally meet him in person
But I just flushed the yayo what could he say do
Trying to flip on me, once was on the payroll
Trying to laylow he can't find what he need
So instead I'm cuffed taken down for some weed
But it's just for a short say, I call the Firm then emerge
On the streets to return the next court day

But NORE know gat (why)

Irak'll make you famous
Throwing gang signs like it's sign language
Distinguish us from the others
Kidnap your baby mothers
Bringing drama to the deep covers
Salute G, bust you down like a loosey
Jose probably lay with a gold uzi
Conquer Italy, Africa and Sicily
Niggas acting sissy see
Pointing guns and missing me

Hey yo there's beef in the hood again
Niggas came with hoods again
Thinking that it woulda been
Saw us, from what we first did
When we did
Now we twist another wig, a mother lose another kid
But it's beef now, keep it short
Real brief now
Strike vigorous, no intentions of missing it
They sent the message, or example, whatever
Set it up man on man
Only to score we apply the plan
Quickly explain why you ran in this dark land
We lay you down in the sand
On the lines like the internet
Many would come if you would pose off
Against my set, there ain't a nigga yet
Smoke so much, niggas say I need Nicorette
You say bogie but you used to say cigarette

It's like a bad dream
And I can't wake up
Mouth caked up
Knowing these cats is fake fucks
And it ain't right
With no love, them hugs ain't tight
Son we used to pop bottles and slugs the same night

Hey yo they left me
Right hand damaged and I ain't lefty
Couldn't bust when I's supposed to pull
What I'm supposed to do?
Lay down, watch these niggas spray me
Or maybe
We strike accurate
Blaze them plus they ladies

I woulda never thought we'd ever get caught
In this way of life
Prosecution, if you violate a player's rights
Say it twice
Nature soon to be engraved in ice
Hanging off my neck
Glistens like it's framed in light

Niggas call me Jose
Shootin the Artie Clay
Benedict Arnold type
Getting this rap loot
Still selling China White
Either Allah or Christ
Married to marijuana
Now my niggas don't write

I'm leaving

You got the nerve to say that Nature's slipping?
The greatest vision
Bald-head kid
Cartier frames, the latest Pippens
Doggystyle was my favorite position
Until I switched it, dead shit
Got on some head shit
Headed in the wrong direction up in the Sheraton
QB to LA still puffing my medicine
For those lost in the streets up north or deceased
For those struggling unfortunate to eat
I dedicate this, tell me right now how do you rate this?
Whatever happened to the mule and the 40 acres
It's outrageous, the way the god finesse the basics

Brought a pound with me, Feds floating around silly

Shoulda known she was a bitch that we both could'a boned
To post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone

Will you drive or will you fly - hold up, my other side

I met a girl from Arkensal

Her daddy was a banker in Little Rock
She had a mansion on white collared street
The next morning my Washington woman woke up without me

From city to city, and state to state, I get her in shame
My Washington woman had six months left
Before out child would bring her pain

That Arkensal woman hurt me
As we crossed the Arkensal line
But the arms of Seattle
Are the arms that kept huggin' mine

For year I have basked in expensive wines
Taste champagne every day
I gave up all the things I loved
For all these things I hate

I locked up all of her forgiveness, the day I set myself free
And the heart of my Washington woman stopped beating for me

My Washington woman sends me a letter every once in a while
Inside a folded wordless page is a picture of my child
All but words, the room grows cold with a feeling of jealousy
And there's a silence between
My Arkensal woman and me",My Washington Woman,1970

THe First National Band,"Her name was Joanne, and she lived in a meadow by a pond.
And she touch'd me for a moment,
with a look that spoke to me of her sweet love.
Then the woman that she was drove her on with desperation,
and I saw as she went a most hopeless situation.
For Joanne, and the man, and the time that made them both wrong.
 
She was only a girl, I know that will, and still I could not see;
That the hold she had was much stronger than the love she had for me.
But staying with her, and my little bit of wisdom,
broke down her desires like a light thru a prism;
into yellows and blues and a tune that I could not have sung.
 
Tho' the essence is gone,
I have no tear to cry for her 
and my only tho't of her is kind.

To save the world, will it be dissent?
