Peter Gabriel,"I picture you in the sun
Wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees
Asking for sympathy
And being caught in between
All you wish for and all you seem
And trying to find anything
You can feel that you can believe in

May gods love be with you , always [Repeat: x1]

I know I would apologize
If I could see your eyes
'cause when you showed me myself, you know
I became someone else
But I was caught in between
All you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake

May gods love be with you, always [Repeat: x3]
May gods love be with you

'Cause if I find - if I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find, if I find my own way [Repeat: x2]
How much will I find [Repeat: x2]
You, yeah, you
I'll find you, you, you, oh [Repeat: x3]

Oh I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there is anyone
Who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand
'cause I've been caught in between
All I wish for and all I seem
Or maybe you're not even sure
What it's for
Anymore than me

May gods love be with you
Always
May gods love be with you [Repeat: x1]
Be with you ...",In the Sun,1997
Peter Gabriel,"A kind and steady heart can make a grey sky blue,
And a task that seems impossible, is quite possible for you.
A kind and steady heart, is sure to see you through.
It may not seem like very much right now,

It'll do, it'll do.
When you find yourself in the middle of a storm,
And you're tired and cold and wet,
And you're looking for a place that's cozy and warm,

You'll make it; you can never forget!
A kind and steady heart, can conquer doubt and fear.
A little courage goes a long, long way,
Gets you a little bit farther down the road each day,

And before you know it, you'll hear someone say,
""That'll do, Babe, that'll do.""
A kind and steady heart, is sure to see you through.
A little courage goes a long, long way,

Gets you a little bit farther down the road each day,

Peter Gabriel,"It was only one hour ago
It was all so different then
Nothing yet has really sunk in
Looks like it always did
This flesh and bone
Is just the way that we are tied in
But there's no one home
I grieve, for you
You leave, me
So hard to move on
Still loving what's gone
They say life carries on
Carries on and on and on and on

The news that truly shocks
Is the empty, empty page
While the final rattle rocks
It's empty, empty cage
And I can't handle this
I grieve, for you
You leave, me
Let it out and move on
Missing what's gone
They say life carries on
They say life carries on and on and on

Life carries on in the people I meet
In everyone that's out on the street
In all the dogs and cats
In the flies and rats
In the rot and the rust
In the ashes and the dust
Life carries on and on and on and on
Life carries on and on and on
Life carries on and on and on and on
Life carries on and on and on
Just the car that we ride in
The home we reside in
The face that we hide in
The way we are tied in
As life carries on and on and on and on
Life carries on and on and on

Did I dream this belief
Or did I believe this dream?
Now I will find relief
I grieve",I Grieve,1998
Peter Gabriel,"Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin'the tree
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree

Waiting your time, dreaming of a better life
Waiting your time, you're more than just a wife
You don't want to do what your mother has done
She has done
This is your life, this new life has begun
It's your day, a woman's day
It's your day, a woman's day

Turning the tide, you are on the incoming wave
Turning the tide, you know you are nobody's slave
Who can hear all the truth in what you say
They can support you when you're on your way
It's your day, a woman's day
It's your day, a woman's day

Peter Gabriel,"Look...
Look at me,
I'm not just what you want to see.
Look at me,
I'm so young and I'm so old.

And God gave me a heart.
And God gave me a mind.
And God gave me my life, twice.

[Chorus]
And I... I feel deeper than any ocean
You could ever swim in.
I love bigger than any sky that you've ever seen
With your two blind eyes, baby; your so blind.

I'm a child;
I will remain so.
The spirit is the same, its the same,
In the same place I have my temple.
Nothing can take it away.

And I tried to be like the sun;
I'm of the sun.
I tried to shine through my life time.

Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun.

Peter Gabriel,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Son"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'll say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""
(Hey, back home)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", I said, ""you can keep my things, they've come to take me home""",Solsbury Hill [Full Length Live Version],1999
Peter Gabriel,"The palpitating cherry-red organ was returned to its rightful place and began to beat faster as it led our hero, counting out time, through his first romantic encounter. 

I'm counting out time,
Got the whole thing down by numbers.
All those numbers!
Give me guidance!
O Lord I need that now.

The day of judgement's come,
And you can bet that I've been resting,
for this testing,
Digesting every word the experts say.
Erogenous zones I love you.
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Found a girl I wanted to date,
Thought I'd better get it straight.
Went to buy a book before it's too late.
Don't leave nothing to fate.
I studied every line, every page in the book,
Now, I've got the real thing here, I'm gonna take a look, take a look.

This is Rael!

I'm counting out time, hoping it goes like I planned it,
'cause I understand it. Look! I've found the hotspots, Figs 1-9.
Still counting out time, got my finger on the button,
""Don't say nuttin' just lie there still
And I'll get you turned on just fine.""
Erogenous zones I love you.
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Touch and go with 1-6.
Bit of trouble in zone No. 7.
Gotta remember all of my tricks.
There's heaven ahead in No. 11!
Getting crucial responses, dilation of the pupils.
""Honey get hip! It's time to unzip, to unzip, zip, zip-a-zip-a-zip.
Whipee!""
(Take it away Mr. Guitar)

I'm counting out time, reaction none to happy,
Please don't slap me,
I'm a red blooded male and the book said I could not fail.
I'm counting out time, I got unexpected distress from my mistress,
I'll get my money back from the bookstore right away.
Erongenous zones I question you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Without you, mankind handkinds through' the blues.",Counting Out Time,1999
Peter Gabriel,"Tell me my life is about to begin
Tell me that I am a hero
Promise me all of your violent dreams
Light up your body with anger
Now, in this ugly world
It is time to destroy all this evil
Now, when I give a word
Get ready to fight for your freedom
Now 

Stand up and fight, for you know we are right
We must strike at the lies
That have spread like disease through our minds
Soon we'll have power, every soldier will rest
And we'll spread out our kindness
To all who our love now deserve
Some of you are going to die 
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide

I'll give you the names of those you must kill
All must die with their children
Carry their heads to the palace of old
Hang them high, let the blood flow
Now, in this ugly world
Break all the chains around us
Now, the crusade has begun
Give us a land fit for heroes
Now 

Stand up and fight, for you know we are right
We must strike at the lies
That have spread like disease through our minds
Soon we'll have power, every soldier will rest

Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide

We are only wanting freedom
We are only wanting freedom
We are only wanting freedom
We are only wanting freedom (Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom)
We are only wanting freedom (Things are getting out of control here today)
We are only wanting freedom (OK men, fire over their heads!)

If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back

Peter Gabriel,"I looked up at the tallest building.
Felt it falling down.

I could feel my balance shifting.
Everything was moving around.

These streets so fixed and solid.
Ah, shimmering haze.

And everything I relied on disappeared.

Downside up, upside down.
Take my weight from the ground.
Falling deep in the sky.
Slipping in the unknown.

All the strangers look like family.
All the family look so strange.

The only constant, I am sure of. 
Is this accelerating rate of change. 

Downside up, upside down.
Take my weight off the ground.
Falling deep in the sky.
Slipping in the unknown.

I stand here, watch you spinning.
Until I am drawn in. 
A centripetal force. 
You pull me in. 

Pull me in.

Peter Gabriel,"Father, son
Locked as one
In this empty room
Spine against spine
Yours against mine
Till the warmth comes through

Remember the breakwaters down by the waves
I first found my courage
Knowing daddy could save
I could hold back the tide
With my dad by my side

Dogs, plows and bows
We move through each pose
Struggling in our separate ways
Mantras and hymns
Unfolding limbs
Looking for release through the pain

And the yogi's eyes are open
Looking up above
He too is dreaming of his daddy's love
With his dad by his side
Got his dad by his side

Can you recall
How you took me to school
We couldn't talk much at all
It's been so many years
And now these tears
Guess I'm still a child

Out on the moors
We take a pause
See how far we have come
You're moving quite slow
How far can we go

Pull down the veil till your eyes are hid.

Can you remember where we both came from.
Let us do as we did.

Look at tomorrow today. 
Making tomorrow today. 
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today. 

Put back the photo under the window.
Put down the 'phone that you hold in your hand.

Put away these things that stand in between us.

When it seems, hopeless. 

Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today.

Than what you can leave behind. 

All the children of your children's children. 
Do you ever think what they're going to find.

Make tomorrow, make tomorrow.
Where the sacred met the scared.

Make tomorrow, make tomorrow.
Where the dreamer's dream is dared.

In each one of us, a dream can burn like the sun.
Let's try it all one more time to get this lesson learned.

Sitting up in a spaceship. 
Looking down at the earth. 
You wonder what they're struggling for. 
What's it all really worth.

Where the sun lives
With the walls so white and blue
In the red soil

They blow across your heart

It's the time of the turning and there's something stirring outside

Peter Gabriel,"Everyday, you crawl into the night 
A fallen angel, with your wings set alight 
When you hit the ground 
Everything turns to blue 
I can't get through the smoke 
That's surrounding you

I can't tell which way is down

Peter Gabriel,"I woke up and the world outside was dark
All so quiet before the dawn
Opened up the door and walked outside
The ground was cold

I walked until I couldn't walk any more
To a place I'd never been
There was something stirring in the air
In front of me, I could see

More than this
More than this
So much more than this
There is something else there
When all that you had has all gone
And more than this
I stand
Feeling so connected
And I'm all there
Right next to you

It started when I saw the ship go down
I saw them struggle in the sea
And suddenly the picture disappears
In front of me

Now we're busy making all our busy plans
On foundations build to last
But nothing fades as fast as the future
And nothing clings like the past, until we can see

More than this
More than this
So much more than this
There is something out there
More than this
It's coming through
And more than this
I stand alone and so connected
And I'm all there
Right next to you

Oh then it's alright
When with every day another bit falls away
Oh but its still alright, alright, alright
And like words together we can make some sense

Much more than this
Way beyond imagination
Much more than this
Beyond the stars
With my head so full
So full of fractured pictures
And I'm all there
Right next to you

More than this
More than this

With evidence this strong?

Look in their eyes, they're checking out you

And more than this

I saw them struggle in the sea
And suddenly the picture disappears

On foundations build to last
But nothing fades as fast as the future
And nothing clings like the past, until we can see

More than this
It's coming through
And more than this

When with every day another bit falls away
Oh but its still alright, alright, alright

With reptile tongue the lightning lashes

Darkness creeps in like a thief
And offers no relief

Something moving in, I taste it in my mouth and in my heart
It feels like dying, slow, letting go of life

Cut up land, each house, a pool, kids wearing water wings, drink in cool
Follow dry river bed, watch Scout and Guides make pow-wow signs

A rattle in the old man's sack, look at mountain top, keep climbing up
Way above us the desert snow, white wind blow

San Jacinto, I hold the line
San Jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight, I hold the line
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I'm losing it, getting weaker
I hold the line, I hold the line

Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
He feels the time is surely now or never more

The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away, drive them away

The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away, drive them away

And Mojique buys his equipment in the market place
Mojique plants devices through the free trade zone
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
He knows his friend the wind is always standing by

Mojique smells the wind that, that comes from far away
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
He feels the presence of the wind beside him
He feels the power of the past behind him
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him on

The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away, drive them away

The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away",Listening Wind,2010
Peter Gabriel,"I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face
That wouldn't let me sleep,
And the street is singing with my feet,
And the dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller.

All down to you, dear.
Everything has changed.

My sorry name
Has made it to graffiti.
I was looking for
Someone to complete me.

Not anymore, dear,
Everything has changed.

When we make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage;
The city sirens, violins.
Everything has changed.

So lift off love.
(down to you, dear)
Lift off love.
(down to you, dear)

We took the town to town last night.
We kissed like we invented it!
And now I know what every step is for:
To lead me to your door.

Know that while you sleep,
Everything has changed.

We made the moon our mirror ball.
The street's an empty stage;
The city sirens, violins.
Everything has changed.
Everything has changed.
Everything has changed.

Down to you, dear, so lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love

Down to you, dear, lift off love
Down to you, dear, lift off love

Of this and that and what is not

And the strain I am under
Be a world child form a circle before we all go under

I caught it in the window
I saw the darkness in my heart
I saw the signs of my undoing
They had been there from the start

And the darkness still has work to do
The knotted chord's untying
The heated and the holy
Oh they're sitting there on high
So secure with everything they're buying

In the blood of Eden
Lie the woman and the man
With the man in the woman
And the woman in the man
In the blood of Eden
Lie the woman and the man

I think I've lost my hold
Yes, I think I've lost my hold
I cannot get insurance anymore
They don't take credit, only gold

Is that a dagger or a crucifix I see
You hold so tightly in your hand
And all the while the distance grows between you and me
I do not understand

In the blood of Eden
Lie the woman and the man
With the man in the woman
And the woman in the man
In the blood of Eden
Lie the woman and the man
We wanted the union
Oh the union of the woman
The woman and the man

At my request, you take me in
In that tenderness, I am floating away
No certainty, nothing to rely on
Holding still for a moment
What a moment this is
Oh for a moment of forgetting, a moment of bliss
Heyyyy

I can hear the distant thunder
Of a million unheard souls
Of a million unheard souls
Watch each one reach for creature comfort
For the filling of their holes

With the man in the woman
And the woman in the man

Peter Gabriel,"Looking down on empty streets, all she can see
Are the dreams all made solid
Are the dreams all made real

All of the buildings, all of those cars
Were once just a dream
In somebody's head

She pictures the broken glass, she pictures the steam
She pictures a soul
With no leak at the seam

Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness comes

Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
Nowhere in the suburbs
In the cold light of day
There in the midst of it so alive and alone
Words support like bone

Dreaming of Mercy Street
Wear your inside out
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
'Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms

Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth
Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest, he's the doctor
He can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness, the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips

Dreaming of Mercy Street
Wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
'Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms

Looking for mercy
Looking for mercy

Peter Gabriel,"Hey, I'm feeling so dirty, you're looking so clean
All you can give is a spin in your washing machine
I fly off to Rome to my prima bella
She leaves me in the rain with telescopic umbrella
Ooh the pain -- Modern love can be a strain

I trusted my Venus was untouched in her shell
But the pearls in her oyster were as tacky as hell
For Lady Godiva I came incognito
But her driver had stolen her red hot magneto
Ooh the pain, modern love can be a strain

I don't know why they leave me in the lurch
To carry on the search
It's  driving me up the wall
Pity when I have so much passion
Romance is out of fashion
Can't handle modern love at all

So I worship Diana by the light of the moon
When I pull out my pipe she screams out of tune
In Paris my heart sinks when I see the Mona Lisa
She gives me the wink, then she shows me the freezer
Ooh the pain
Modern love can be a strain",Modern Love [Original 1977 Promo Video] [*],2013

We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin' 
As majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun 
Sayin', it may be the chimes of freedom crashin'

Flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight 
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night

There's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin' 
Well, electric light still struck like arrows 
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' 

Well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail 
For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale 
And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail 
Yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, starry eyed and laughin' I recall when we were caught 
Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended 
As we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look 
Spellbound and swallowed ""Has the tollin' ended?""

Gives off some kind of heat

The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid

There's no room to avoid

And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright

And the eager pack lift up their pitchers, they carry all they lack

Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

If you are the one to temp me
I am tempted
When it's my turn to speak out
I am empty

When love comes to me this way
I am blasted
Just to hear you say I love you
Is time passing

For you - just for you
For you - just for you

I could be awake all night
In confrontation
Just to hear you say
I'm your main station

There is no gift on earth
That I could give you
I find myself just longing
To be with you

For you - just for you
For you - just for you

I belong to no other
Just as long as you're around dear
No time can match the feeling
That I have found here

For you - just for you

But not like you love your freedom

Help me I think, I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good

Help me I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting hurting too
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom",Help Me,2002

Papalaka papalaka papalaka boo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
Digariga digariga digariga doo
 
The native grieve when the white 
Men leave their huts, because
They're obviously definitely nuts!
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to
The Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindoos and Argentines sleep 
Firmly from twelve to one
But Englishmen detest a siesta
In the Philippines
There are lovely screens

To protect you from the glare
In the Malay States
There are hats like plates
Which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon
And no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete
They're quite impervious to heat
When the white man rides every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he
Will impale his solar topee on a tree
 
Bolyboly bolyboly bolyboly baa
Bolyboly bolyboly bolyboly baa
Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa
Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa
 
It seems such a shame
When the English claim
The earth that they give rise to 
Such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The toughest Burmese bandit
Can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon
Is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down
And lie down in a jungle town

Where the sun beats down
To the rage of man and beast
The English garb
Of the English sahib
Merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok
At twelve o'clock
They foam at the mouth and run
Slut mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The smallest Malay rabbit
Deplores this stupid habit in Hongkong
They strike a gong and
Fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate
Who's in late

In the mangrove swamps
Where the python romps
There is peace from twelve till two
Even caribous
Lie around and snooze
For there's nothing else 
To do in Bengal to move 
At all is seldom, if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen,1995
Peter Greenwell,"Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington
Don't put your daughter on the stage 
The profession is overcrowded
And the struggle's pretty tough
And admitting the fact 
She's burning to act
That isn't quite enough
She has nice hands
Give the wretched girl her due
But don't you think her bust is too 
Developed for her age?
I repeat, Mrs. Worthington
Sweet Mrs. Worthington
Don't put your daughter on the stage

Regarding yours
Dear Mrs. Worthington
Of Wednesday the twenty-third
Although your baby 
May be keen on a stage career
How can I make it clear
This is not a good idea?
For her to hope
Dear Mrs. Worthington
Is, on the face of it, absurd
Her personality
Is not, in reality
Exciting enough
Inviting enough
For this particular sphere

Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington
Don't put your daughter on the stage
She's a bit of an ugly duckling
You must honestly confess
And the width of her seat 
Would surely defeat
Her chances of success
It's a loud voice
And though it's not exactly flat
She'll need a little more than that
To earn a living wage
On my knees, Mrs. Worthington
Please, Mrs. Worthington
Don't put your daughter on the stage

Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington
Don't put your daughter on the stage
Though they said at the school of acting
She was lovely as Peer Gynt
I fear on the whole 
An ingénue role
Would emphasize her squint
She's a big girl
And though her teeth are fairly good
She's not the type I ever would
Be eager to engage
No more buts, Mrs. Worthington
Nuts, Mrs. Worthington
Don't put your daughter on the stage",Mrs. Worthington,1995
Peter Greenwell," Verse 1
 
 The world for some years
 Has been sodden with tears
 On behalf of the Acting profession,
 Each star playing a part
 Seems to expect the 'Purple Heart',
 It's unorthodox
 To be born in a box
 But it needn't become an obsession,
 Let's hope we have no worse to plague us
 Than two shows a night at Las Vegas.
 When I think of physicians
 And mathematicians
 Who don't earn a quarter the dough,
 When I look at the faces
 Of people in Macy's
 There's one thing I'm burning to know:
 
 Refrain 1
 
 Why must the show go on?
 It can't be all that indispensable,
 To me it really isn't sensible
 On the whole
 To play a leading role
 While fighting those tears you can't control,
 Why kick up your legs
 When draining the dregs
 Of sorrow's bitter cup?
 Because you have read
 Some idiot has said,
 'The Curtain must go up'!
 I'd like to know why a star takes bows
 Having just returned from burying her spouse.
 Brave boop-a-doopers,
 Go home and dry your tears,
 Gallant old troupers,
 You've bored us all for years
 And when you're so blue,
 Wet through
 And thoroughly woe-begone,
 Why must the show go on?
 Oh Mammy!
 Why must the show go on?
 
 Verse 2
 
 We're asked to condole
 With each tremulous soul
 Who steps out to be loudly applauded,
 Stars on opening nights
 Sob when they see their names in lights,
 Though people who act
 As a matter of fact
 Are financially amply rewarded,
 It seems, while pursuing their calling,
 Their suffering's simply appalling!
 But butchers and bakers
 And candlestick makers
 Get little applause for their pains
 And when I think of miners
 And waiters in 'Diners'
 One query for ever remains:
 
 Refrain 2
 
 Why must the show go on?
 The rule is surely not immutable,
 It might be wiser and more suitable
 Just to close
 If you are in the throes
 Of personal grief and private woes.
 Why stifle a sob
 While doing your job
 When, if you use your head,
 You'd go out and grab
 A comfortable cab
 And go right home to bed?
 Because you're not giving us much fun,
 This 'Laugh Clown Laugh' routine's been overdone,
 Hats off to Show Folks
 For smiling when they're blue
 But more comme-il-faut folks
 Are sick of smiling through,
 And if you're out cold,
 Too old
 And most of your teeth have gone,
 Why must the show go on?
 I sometimes wonder
 Why must the show go on?
 
 Refrain 3
 
 Why must the show go on?
 Why not announce the closing night of it?
 The public seem to hate the sight of it,
 Dear, and so
 Why you should undergo
 This terrible strain we'll never know.
 We know that you're sad,
 We know that you've had
 A lot of storm and strife
 But is it quite fair
 To ask us to share
 Your dreary private life?
 We know you're trapped in a gilded cage
 But for Heaven's sake relax and be your age,
 Stop being gallant
 And don't be such a bore,
 Pack up your talent,
 There's always plenty more
 And if you lose hope
 Take dope
 And lock yourself in the John
 Why must the show go on?
 I'm merely asking
 Why must the show go on?",Why Must the Show Go On?,1995
Peter Guidi,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

So fine, banging from left to right

She copped ? the girls who roll by

Up there on the dance floor
And I gotta let you know
That I'm digging you
Baby, I love the things you do
Don't stop till I get enough of you
Keep it moving, don't stop doing what you're doing

I'm thinking, can we get down in every hotel
From the Sheraton to the Placid Crown
? you and me
In the embassy, tell me, could it be, could it be
I make my way across the floor
Then say girl it's just the way
The way you look, you make other girls shook
The way you shake, you make other girls hate
The way you move, girl you can't lose
Let me get up on this dance floor and get to know you
The way you're dressed, such style and finesse
And you know you've been pimping my dear
I just had to let you know that you're so beautiful

Only mess with lames if the brains is prolific

Another three or four of those, she at the back of the coup
She rapping the loot, but fuck 'em

However you want it, neck, ears, wrist, it's flooded

And we searchin' for this n**** to try
I'm bubblin' mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time

I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defendin my son's rhymes
'Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence

Bustin' off I'm runnin' into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
'Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it

Puffin with my family, my b****, my money or my music
Makin' killas say he's too sick when he do s***
But I'm on some new s***, and it's too late the fuse lit

Can't take it no more, n****s is fake to the core

Is a glock nineteen, and I'm a pop like steam
Tryin' to stop me and mine from eatin' you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads n**** to stop you from leakin'

And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin'

Peter Hammill,"Look at the candle, as it's life is bought,
as the wick just rolls of and dies;
look at the wax-drops as they cease from their goal
and the game they were playing loses its joy
and the youth which they played in runs away....
How long will you be gone?

Flames sucks at air now and its breath comes short
as it wavers to half its size;
vacuum closes in and it attacks the soul.
Now the force omnipotent itself is destroyed
and for lack of itself it wanes away....
How long will you be gone?

So does my mind fly as I fight my thought -
and I lose, for I cannot find:
sent my eyes long miles, they do not know home!
For the life I was part of breathes its last
and not only life, but hope has gone away....
How long will you be gone?
How long will you be gone ",Candle,1971
Peter Hammill,"I don't know quite what's happening
and my eyes don't see too clear;
all I know is I need you here,
if only to shield me from the mood of the world
and hold me and say it doesn't matter....
but I'm like a child whose dreams are shattered,

Crowding round me: images of broken thought,
lines of my life now overgrown.
All I can feel is I'm so alone,
without even your bright eyes to reach into my mind
and say that in my life I've done right,
and I'm like a moonchild in the sunlight.

So cast your thoughts upon me, wherever you are,
that I may feel you close beside me
and hold your hand, for you to guide me
through all these catacombs which freeze me
with their touch; 
unknowing, knowing so much, my mind cries out
and I'm like a child when the light's out

With a child's fear of the dark ",Child,1971
Peter Hammill,"How was it that we first met?
...I forget, all I know is you
looked happy.
We walked around and talked a while;
In your smile I found that I
was happy.
I want to tell you;
it seems a thing to do;
I want to show I truly care.
Now at every time we meet
we walk the streets, I'm with you and I
feel happy.
Just thought I'd tell you.
It seems a thing to do,
I want to prove I truly care.
But how long will all this last?
Time goes fast, It doesn't matter,
with you, I'm happy.
Time goes fast, It doesn't matter, with you
I'm happy.

",Happy,1971
Peter Hammill,"I once wrote some poems of stillness and silence,
standing by rivers of reflected light:
my thoughts were on being loved and yet unloved, too -
I surrendered to the warmth of the night.
And now I feel like dying,
and if the water were still here, it would
hold me close.

I once wrote a poem while walking on gravestones,
as cobbles, rain and tear lashed down my face....
I then felt my whole world was fading
as memories jostled and fell into place.
And now I feel like dying,
and the pain of old fires still burns.

I never wrote poems when I bit my knuckles
and Death started slipping into my mouth...
but that was really a long time ago,
and I'm not writing poems now.
And though I don't feel quite like dying,
there is something deep inside me
softly crying.

And though I don't feel quite like dying
there is something deep inside me softly....

",I Once Wrote Some Poems,1971
Peter Hammill," If you catch me running along by the sea, with bare feet in
the sand, then you'll know I am dreaming my life out in a way
you won't understand.
I'm slipping right out of your mind, this I know, and I accept
the fact lazily, for I must go into the next field,
where grass is green and I'll find peace.
Let me sleep!
Let me dream!
Let me be!
Reawakening isn't easy when you're tired.
Don't push me: I was taught self-expression
when I was a child, and so I know
the best way to go is slow.

Sometimes, when skies are cloud-grey, and trouble's hanging
heavy on your mind, I advise you: curl up, slid away and
dream your life out, as I am.
Reawakening isn't easy when you're tired.
Don't push me: I was taught self-expression
when I was a child, and so I see
the best way to be's asleep.

Reawakening isn't easy when you're tired ",Re-Awakening,1971
Peter Hammill,"Silently I rest in the tall green grassand look steadily upwards.Birds sing ceaselessly around me,and the blue of the sky surrounds me strangely.Out here, life is at its essence,and watches the world with innocent eyes;far from grime, far from rushing people it seems that I have found a tiny peace.On the blue backdrop of the unknownwater droplets trace their paths;on the sky, mortals hang on metal -but who is to know how long either will last?The lovely white clouds glideacross the sky and into my dreams...I feel as though I had died some time ago:now I'll wander with the clouds through eternal space.
",Solitude,1971
Peter Hammill,"Summer song in the autumn, for you didn't catch
the colour of the falling leaves.
So many words have been spoken which you
didn't understand and so couldn't believe.
And the song that you're humming is yesterday's tune -
Someone who you love is leaving you.

You walking in sunshine by the sea with gull crying overhead;
but now the skies are cloudy, and the love you had is dead.
And the water recedes from the farthest dunes -
Someone who you loved is leaving you.

You remember the happiness you had
as you laughed along in the sun
but now your eyes are coming dull,
there's a numbness on your tongue....

You look out at the water which is calling you
over the wind,
then you throw aside your handbag and slowly
walk right in.
And tomorrow you'll be in yesterday's news:
someone who you loved has left you

Peter Hammill,"Looking out forward over the prow of our long ship,
pulling our oars and listening to the foam;
helmets and sheepskins salt-damp in the sea-mist:
We're going home.

Aslak of Langadale, Einar Thorgeirsson,
Olaf the White and Sigurd the Powerful...

Looking for constellations above the horizon,
West wind cutting sharper than our blades;
smiling forever into an endless sunrise,
we're flying on the waves.

Thorfin Karlsefny, Aud the Deep-Minded,
Snorri Thorbrandsson, Thorstein the Black....

Out of dark Vinland, with grey waves racing before us -
We want no rest.
Back to the homeland, Iceland, sleeping in winter -
back from the West.
Five years we roam;
now we're going home

Peter Hammill,"Spring came far too early this year,
May flowers blooming in February.
Should I be sad for the months,
Or glad for the sky?
The birds don't know which way to sing and, my friends,
Neither do I.

Two days ago, a girl I truly thought I loved
Suddenly didn't seem to matter at all.
Should I sing sad farewell to things
I'm really glad I've left behind?
The birds don't know which way to sing and, my friends,
Neither do I.

In another day, heavy snow will lie upon the ground,
And buds prematurely bloomed shall fail,
And every creature living now, then will
Surely die

The birds don't know which way to sing and, my friends,
Neither do I.
The birds don't know if it's time yet to fly,
And they don't know which way to go and, my friend,
Neither do I. [Repeat: x4]",The Birds [#][*][Demo Version],1971
Peter Hammill,"My, friends, I never really thought you'd go,
But, then, we know that's the way it happens here
Now time is like cat's cradle in my hands
We gather up the strands much to slowly
The refugees are gone... They take their separate paths,
Obliterate the past, figures in an ash shroud
Susie, I guess you're on your way to be a star,
But I don't know where you are, the only time I seem
To see you is on T.V.
It's so easy just to slip away...

Mike!
It's a year or two since I've seen you...
I might
Have dropped you a line if I'd had time
Or the will
It's my fault too, I play a hermit's role
Of cars and stages, wages, super-soul
Hardly ever seem to get outside these days
So, dear friends, as we grow on we feel to grow away,
Can only live in the hope that some day
It will all return
It's so easy just to slip away...",Easy to Slip Away,1973
Peter Hammill,"Manheim; rainy Saturday with no money nor friend,
Only Tequila can end the boredom.
Try to reach London for a pocket of hope;
We're children, we grope in the dark.
Hugh spends his last Mark on coffee and cheese...
I feel just like a refugee...
Rathaus-keepers and traffic police,
Middle-aged maids with rotting teeth
Industrial magazines and old Sunday Times;
Reading material/bleeding lines.
What are we doing here?
Memorial manace, eager for revenge,
Has begun to bend our minds.
Shower-curtain imperative in the presence of acid;
Now, feeling placid is death.
I try to hold my breath as the P.A. comes down...
Here we all are in Ktown!
The Big Wheel never fails to grind around;
It drags me up/drags me down
Seven sentences wonder 'Can this be real,
Or am I become a performing seal?'
Why are we dying here?
I walk the streets alone, try to find a sign of love,
I've crushed the plaster-bone in the freaky clubs,
I have bit the fruit
But all I live for is to play
And I'm tired of the nights and the days
Of airports, taxis and motorway showers,
Grooping for a key in the after hours.
David takes to traveling in the van,
He knows that we all can understand;
We're at the mercy of the Kosmos Tour,
Making a pilgrimage to the German Lourdes...
But we're still crippled here.
Cathedrals spiral skywards, I think I'm getting vertigo,
I think I don't know what is real.
On a more sudden spotlight, one more madness is over...
I must not show a sign of fear.
Words echo round my ears, I think I'm going to laugh...
Think I'll just go and take a bath, Guess I'll wash my clothes,
Don't you know I'll grow to go and make my name,
Maybe a servant in the Fame game;
Stake my sane and rest my life on the line...
Now lay me asunder and rend my mind;
At the fall of the curtain let this be my ghost...",German Overalls,1973
Peter Hammill,"Watch for the silent moments, only waiting to be saved
Wait for the lie maker, he comes again
And sinks his barbs through honesty
Roll him over with all possible speed
Don't let him touch you with the candle of his need
Or let him be, hysterically ravaging your grave
You are emotion picture, re-run at single frame
You are the instant playback, no chance to change
Smile and smile, living diary!
Roll you over before it's too late

Before you're exposed to the monochrome phase
Which can relate only fear and hate through the haze
I am the automated arrow, homing on the heat of pain
I am the Peacebringer, it is so strange
I feed on grief and grieve through joy
So roll me over and turn aside
Don't let me look into the mirror of your eyes
For fear that I
May steel the life
You gradly gave",Rock and Rôle,1973
Peter Hammill,"I saw your picture in the Evening Standard:
You were wearing your battle dress.
I really must confess
That I shed a silent smile for you -
It had really blown my mind,
I wonder, are you still so kind?
Are you still so pure?
There are other rhymes around here somewhere,
But I'm not sure how they fit...
Jenny, penny for your thoughts, I wonder how you're
Thinking now;
I hesitate to visualize: our worlds are much too
Different,
That's a sign of the times.
Time was when I read your cards
And wrote the numbers in the dust;
I can't remember what they were, but anyhow,
I missed the cusp
So, so long, and so, goodbye
Do you think I'll recognize you by your hair
Or by you mind now?
We start out together
But the paths all divide:
When there are no more crossroads
I open my eyes
And find I'm walking on alone
Through the snowy cold...
I wonder if I'll make it through the night?
I'm an author and an actor too;
You're a model in the zoo...
I'm just thinking on which side of the bars
I'm looking through.
If I prophesied an avalanche
Would you wait and call my bluff?
If I gave you just a little song
Would that be enough
To save your life
Or is the knife already turning in my hand?",Slender Threads,1973
Peter Hammill,"What's it worth to be safe?
What's the way to be sane?
I could throw myself at the garden
On my hands,
Prune the lawn and mow the roses,
But I never understand
How to go
To ber free;
In the end I only want to be me.
Winter days here are mine;
Still, no bites, what's my line?
I could hurl myself to the bonfire
With all nerve,
Clear the path and weed the dead leaves,
But I really just don't have the nerve
To be part
If that scene
Is this just some kind of strange dream?
Think I'll walk to the sleep, where the people
Are so inquisite.
I could make it to the corner store and buy
A hoard of derivatives
Now.
Which way now... climb or coast?
Will my eggs ever poach?
I could throw myself in the frying pan
For the sake of my name;
Hit the road or smile hermetically,
But it's really never quite the same;
Every time a subtle twist,
I think I'll grab my plot
And simply exist
Or would that be
A subtle slash at my wrists?",What's It Worth,1973
Peter Hammill,"With my face drained of colour
And my brain of blood
Like Billy Budd
I'm lashed to the grating;
With senses growing duller
And with quaking heart
I make a start
At temperature equating
And my lungs suck useless air.
Like paraplegic dancers
In format
Ion team
My understanding seems
Hiidebound in its movements,
Contemplating answers
That could break my bonds--
To be half wrong
Would be, in me, improvement...
But my comprehensive faculties are impaired.
And it seems absurd, but now all I've heard
F
Ades in empty words and is worthless
As the Human Laugh rocks the cenotaph
But the joke is half-true, and mirthless.
Trying to trace a reason
From the spinning words
But all I've heard
Seem at odds with their meanings,
Phonetically pleasing
But deliv
Ered in such haste
That in their place
My mind commences screaming.
On the verge of belief I crash onto the reef
And a cynical thief steals my senses,
So I cling to the pew with dimensions askew,
And recognition refuses present tenses.
All the lives
 of the saints demonstrate that my faint
Is a minor complaint, but the end is
Nowhere in sight,
Why can't I find me a way to go?
I don't want to die in the nave,
But I know it may be with me some day
So I've got to find a way I can save up
My evergies, and find a cause to pray
So something for something
To which I can give my creed...
I'd gladly succumb to the wave,
If I thought the water taught a way to light;
I'd gladly succumb--I'm not brave,
And it's easy to believe what the preacher says
Except for the conflict raging between my head
And my brain.
I don't want to die, but just the same--
Some day....
Waiting for that moment
That I know will come
When I'll have to run
And find another sermon...
Everyman and Norman
And the talking priest--
Still, I am at least
Holding all the doors open.
Inside me all outside is shared.
As the cracked bells peal it all seems unreal
But the seventh seal stays unbroken
And the Offertory plate tenders no escape--
Still I refuse to scrape up a token
Of e
Steem for these false
Alleyways of the course;
I must try to divorce sense from sensing.

Tell me the way to go.

Peter Hammill,"Time has come between us:
In the passing months I've felt you slip away
As your words and mine came like nursery rhymes
Till there was nothing left to say.
Distance came between us long ago,
As our memories faded away...
Over the miles I ceased to smile
Because nothing felt the same.
That's how it seemed a week ago,
Far off in time and space.
Time and distance are between us now,
They form a bond to make things sure.
Nothing ever shatters,
You know what happens:
Time and distance make a love secure.",Ferret and Featherbird,1974
Peter Hammill,"When I was a child they made me read
Word-daggers of quiver and squirm
Now in the stumbling dark I see I am
A worm silently fruiting your garden

Meanings on the purity of my soul
I feel devilish leanings I'm beginning
To lose control and the vortex sucks
Me in steeped in sin I die but am
Reborn
I want to see the cosmos slip planets
And moons collide feel gravity lose

Know that I will find myself or maybe

Peter Hammill,"Where are all the joys of yesterday?
Where, now, is the happiness and laughter that we shared?
Gone, like our childhood dreams, aspirations and beliefs --
Time is a thief, and he ravages our gardens,
Stripping saplings, felling trees,
Trampling on our flowers, sucking sap and drying seeds.
In the midnight candle-light of experience
All colour fades, green fingers grey....
Time, alone, shall murder all the flowers,
Still, there's time to share our plots and all that we call 'ours'.
How much worse, then, if we all deny each others' needs
And keep our garden's privately?
Its getting colder, wind and rain leave gashes;
Looking back, I only see the friends I've lost.
Fires smoulder, raking through the ashes
My hands are dirty, my mind is numb,
I count the cost of 'I' :
""I need to get on, I've got to tend my garden;
Got to shut you out, no time to crave your pardon now"".
Now I see the garden that I've grown is just the same
 as those outside;
The fences, erected to protect, simply divide....
There's ruination everywhere, the weather has
 played havoc with the grass --
Does anyone believe his garden's really going to last?
In the time allotted us, can any man keep miserly his own?
Is there any pleasure in a solitary growth?
Come and see my garden if you will ----
I'd like someone to see it all before each root is killed.
Surely now its time to open up each life to all ----
Tear down the walls, if its not too late!
There is so much sorrow in the world;
There is so much emptiness and heartbreak and pain;
Somewhere on the road we have all taken a wrong
 turn ----
How can we build the right path again?
Through the grief, through the pain,
Our flowers need each others' rain....",Forsaken Gardens,1974
Peter Hammill,"Genuflection, erection in church.
Sacristy cloth, moth-eaten shroud.
Secret silence, sacred secrets
Accumulate dust, aggravate the eye.

Incautious laughter after confession.
Benediction, fictional fear
Hidden faces, grace is a name,
Like Chastity, like Lucifer, like mine.

You took me through the window-stain,
Drowned in image, incense, choir-refrain
And slow ecstasy 
I'd embrace you if I only knew your name

The silent corner haunts my shadow prayers
Ice-cold statue, rapture divine,
Unconscious eyes,
The open mouth,

The wound of love,
The Lie.
You took me, gave me reasons for
Saints and missals, vigils, all the more

I'd embrace you, but it would be

Just another lie

Peter Hammill,"Sometimes it's very scary here; sometimes it's very sad;
Sometimes I think I'll disappear; betimes I think I have.
There's a line snaking down my mirror :
Splintered glass distorts my face,
And though the light is strong and strange
It can't illuminate the musty corners of this place.
There is a lofty, lonely, Lohengrenic castle in the clouds --
I draw my murky meanings there,
But seven years' dark luck is just around the corner
And in the shadows lurks the spectre of Despair.
A cracked mirror mid the drapes of the landing :
Split image, labored understanding ----
I'm only trying to find a place to hide my home ....
I've lived in houses composed of glass
Where every movement is charted,
But now the monitor screens are dark
And I can't tell if silent eyes are there.
My words are spiders upon the page,
They spin out faith, hope and reason ----
But are they meet and just, or only dust
 gathering about my chair?
Sometimes I get the feeling that there's
Someone else there :
The faceless watcher makes me uneasy,
I can feel him through the floorboards,
 and His presence is creepy ----
He informs me that I shall be expelled ....
What is that but out of and into :
I don't know the nature of the door that I'd go through,
I don't know the nature of the nature
 that I am inside ....
I've lived in houses of brick and lead
Where all emotion is sacred,
And if you want to devour the fruit
You must first sniff at the fragrance
And lay your body before the shrine
With poems and posies and papers ----
Or, if you catch the ruse, you'll have to choose
To stay, a monk, or leave, a vagrant.
What is this place you call home?
Is it a sermon or a confession?
Is it the chalice that you use for protection?
Is it really only somewhere you can stay?
Is it a rule-book or a lecture?
Is it a beating at the hands of your Protector?
Does the idol have feet of clay?
Home is what you make it, so my friends
 all say,
But I rarely see their homes in these dark days.
Some of them are snails and carry houses
 on their backs;
Others live in monuments which, one day,
 will be racks --
I keep my home in place with sellotape
 and tin-tacks,
But I still feel there's some other Force here :
He who cracks the mirrors and moves the walls
Keeps staring through the eye-slits of the portraits
 in my hall;
He ravages my library and taps the telephone --
I've never actually seen Him,
But I know He's in my home
And if he goes away,
I can't stay here either.
I believe -- er -- I think --
Well, I don't know ......
I only live in one room at a time,
But all of the walls are ears, all the windows, eyes :
Everything else is foreign,
'Home' is my wordless chant :
Mmmmmaah!
Give it a chance!
I am surrounded by flesh and bone,
I am a temple of living,
I am a hermit, I am a drone,
And I am boning out a place to be.
With secret garlands about my head
Unearthly silence is broken :
The room is growing dark, and in the stark light
I can see a face I know ----
Could this be the guy who never shows
The cracked mirror what he's feeling,
Merely mumbles prayers to the ground where
 he's kneeling :
""Home is home is home is home is home is home is me!""
All you people looking for your houses,
Don't throw your weight around, you might
 break your glasses
And if you do, you know you just can't see
And then how are you to find the dawning
 of the day?
--- Day is just a word I use to keep the dark
 at bay,
And people are imaginary, nothing else exists
Except the room I'm sitting in,
And, of course, the all-pervading mist ---
Sometimes I wonder if even that's real ....
Maybe I should de-louse this place;
Maybe I should de-place this louse;
Maybe I'll maybe my life away
In the confines of this silent house.
Sometimes it's very scary here; sometimes it's very sad;
Sometimes I think I'll disappear; sometimes I think ..... """,A Louse Is Not a Home,1974
Peter Hammill,"Once, all the stars in the sky were bright,
 now they're red and fading
And all the colours we wore, the shades that we bore
 have moved.
And the gold turns to red with no time for changes :
Red Shift, all moving away from we.
Once, constellations were holy, now darkness pervades
 all the older ones
And in the brunt of implosion, all yesterday's golden
 now reddened suns ....
And hope is a word with no space for blame in ---
Red Shift, displaced now in time and relativity;
Red Shift, all moving away from we.
So here I am, though I might well be with me :
I'm falling down deep to the rim of the wheel.
Is it sham?
Does the world have a meaning?
The more that we know , the greater confusion grows :
Stars are like atoms, and atoms are patterns
And probably in the end :
'Maybe its all been a dream ....'
Time locked in negative matter, all theories shatter
 beneath the weight.
Happy is the man who believes that the world
 is a dream and all reason, fate.

The eye moves on with no rhyme,

Your changing life? You've come into a cruel

Willie, try to stay a child sometime, for as long
As you feel you can learn. Babies all turn to
People, and people can really be strange : they
Change and, changing, bring pain.
Try to treat your parents well because they care,
And what more can you do?
When you find your lovers, be good to them as
You hope they'll be to you ------
Be honest,
Be true.
Willie, you are the future; all our lives, in the end,
Are in your hands. Life's hard now --- you know,
It gets harder, and hope is but a single strand;
We pass it on and hope you'll understand....
We know that we do it wrong, we're not so strong
And not so sure at all; groping in our blindness,
We may seem big now but, really, we're so small
And alone and searching for a home

Meanwhile you're still a baby; you'll be a lady
Soon enough and then you will feel the burn.

Peter Hammill,"Your father has just left your mother,
Gone off to live with his latest lover:
She sits there, just staring.
So you get back to your own flat
Because the atmosphere in there
Is so bad you can't bear it.
And the people you were going to America with
Just left on the dawn plane
Without you,
Without you.
The people in the downstairs flat
Are no longer there now because they left
The gas tap on, they're all dead.
So you've no-one left to talk to,
You just lie there in melancholy,
Half-naked on your unmade bed.
And the people you were going to Africa with
Just left on the Southern Star
Without you,
Without you.
Yes, the haze that's been forming round your window-panes
Is now protracted and poisoned
And you cannot feel a portion of the world outside.
Can you imagine the way you'd feel
If all these things had happened to you
And the doctor says you're dying?

On finding that your love belongs

And you're lonely.",People You Were Going To,1975
Peter Hammill,"You can see in the 1st light that's graced as dawn
That there's nothing in my heart but pain
As I stand, facing sea, knowing that you're gone
All the elements rage to explain
That I should really be on my way,
But there is something
Which ensures I must stay

Beneath the roar of the seething surf,
Beneath the caterwaul of scattered call wind
Thoughts and gestures unspoken, unheard
And now the dance of rapture begins
As the waves rush along across the beach
Like you, like your love
Forever out of reach

Look at the sky, but it's empty now;
Look at the sea, it holds nothing but despair
I raise my eyes, but my head stays bower...

No, no, no, no, I just can't get you from my mind",Shingle Song,1975
Peter Hammill,"So here we are, alone -
Our children have grown up and moved away.
Living their own lives, they say...
It all seems very strange to me.

I don't understand their ways:
Our children amaze me all the time
And I often wonder why they make me feel
So sad and suddenly old.

Now we're left with an empty home,
From our nest all the birds have flown for foreign skies.
We're discarded, of no further use,
Though we gave our kids all our youth and all our lives -
We really tried.

Now there's only my wife and me;
We used to have a family - now that's gone
And only memories linger on...
It all seems very wrong to me.

To our sorrows they were quite deaf
And as soon as they could they left us to our tears.
We always tried to teach what was good -
Yes, we gave our kids all we could through all the years.

So here we are at last;
The time has gone so fast and so have my dreams.
I simply don't know what it all means,

This autumn-time, this walk upon the water....

I wonder how long
It will be till this song
Is sung by our own sons and daughters?",Autumn,1977
Peter Hammill,"You turn out the lights and sit alone,
Trying to pretend that it's anguish,
Start at the ring of a telephone,
Throw down all your food at the banquet,
Keep a close eye on all you own,
While leaving it all to languish...
Is this what makes you happy?
Is this what brings you joy?
Your excuses are so crappy...
Silly boy

You take all the love and throw it aside
To wallow in your sorrow,
Expect everyone to know how you feel inside,
To forgive and forget come tomorrow
Repaying all your debts with uncommon pride
But denying that you ever borrowed...
Is this what makes you perfect?
Is this what makes you free?
Just how long did you rehearse it,
Or does it just come naturally?

Crying wolf from the depth of your sheep's heart,
Crying fire from the depth of the well
In an endless parade of repeat starts,
Just how long will it last, can you tell?

Until all your friends and lovers
Are simply bored with the pretense?
It'll be too late then to discover
Just exactly what you meant
And what was true
And what was false...
The wolf turned into human,
The killer with remorse

Crying pain as though that should be pleasure,
Crying anger as though that should be revenge,
Crying sorrow as though that were a treasure,
Your treasure will find you in the end.

When all of your friends have gone away,
Unwilling to put up with the danger
That lies in each spiteful word you say,
You'll be left, a greying wolf in a manger
And when you've raised your last howl

Peter Hammill,"Thinking back, it seems that I
Can lie beside you as I never truly did,
In afterglow
No afterwards at all.
Only writing love songs when it's gone and dead;
Only paying words out: strings of half-forgotten sentiments...
I mean...
I meant...
I never really quite could say the way it was.
The first time that we met I said 'I bet that she's the one',
But I was talking to myself then, as always.
As time went by our steps entwined, unwritten lines drew taut
And I tried to find a way to make it all safe...
Into the play, what a production!
Into the days and ever more suction:
You hold me close, but hold me farther
Away from yourself, I make me a martyr,
For pain and love go hand in hand...
And hand in hand go you and my friend,
You are his and I am yours and just cannot evade you
My days a dream, my nights unseemly,
Stolen moments all I live for,
But theft is no way to persuade you
To come with me, leave him behind you
My hurtful eyes try to remind you
It's all I can do to keep from screaming
'I love you, I love you!' I wish I was dreaming,
But the steps we take all leave footprints...

Sooner or later the whole thing will be blown
You will leave him or I'll be left here, alone
Either way someone loses someone
But I won't mind that, I just would quite like to know
Who we love the most, well, I guess that's ourselves

The days are strange, at night we're strangers,
Lie in bed and lie inside our heads,
We come no closer than as dancers
Your eyes are change, your presence danger,
Won't look me in the face and yet you
Kiss and make up the answer
To all the questions that fly unanswered, unreasoned
Death in the sky, death in the season
If you leave me now, it might nearly kill me....
Remember me?
Remember we three?

It all seemed so important at the time,
We came so close to wrecking all our lives,
And now it's all just song lines
Time heals,
Time heals
Oh, but I still bear the weals

Thinking back, it seems that I

Peter Hammill,"It was the first day of July,
No wind breathed in the sky
When a pin-striped suit
Saw that the Institute of Mental Health was burning

He stood upon the corner
Where the sun was warmer...
Looking across the street,
He moved the shackles on his feet
As the Institute was burning

Flames were roaring, singing like a thunderstorm,
Smoke was pouring straight up to the sky,
Windows smashing, Gothic doors and lintels fall,
Timbers crashing and we both know why.

Nobody else came by to stare,
You see, they didn't really care
Can't call the fire brigade
None of them had been paid
And so the Institute was burning

Throughout the city, people say it isn't pretty,
Everyone agrees, and everyone feels glad,
Doctored brains celebrate and everyone waves their chains...
It's a pity they're all mad

The Institute of Mental Health
Spontaneously killed itself
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
My chains began to rust

as I look into the land laid bare by your eyes;
E-S/M attractions are working behind my thought,
I can't help my feelings, the way that my emotions
are over-wrought.
Refrain:
Good morn
ing, sunshine!
You're all around my head,
Good morning, sunshine!
I'm ready to be led.
Good morning, sunshine!
You know how sad it makes me to see you unhappy
so smile, spread sunshine all around....
How sweet it would be to be chained by your side;
how sweet if you would strip my worried mind.
Your blonde/brown hair hangs down on you,
how I wish that it hung on me,
there's something in your allure, that makes me know I'll
never again be free.
Refrain
I'd like to run on the clouds of my liberty,
but for you I'd get hooked and float six inches mud-free.
The sight of your smile just makes me want to jump and clap;
the fact that you may be owed to someone else can't
entirely tight your trap.

Peter Hammill,"I have a vision of you, locked inside my head;
it creeps upon my mind, and warms me in my bed...
A vision shimering, shifting
moving in false firelight;
a vision of a vision,
protecting me from fear at night,
as the seasons roll on, and my love stays strong.
I don't know where you end, and where it is that I begin.
You simply open my mind, and the memories flood on in.
I remember waking up, with you arms around me;
I remember losing myself
and finding that you'd found me,
as the seasons roll on, and my love stays strong.
Be my child, be my lover, swallow me up in your fire-glow.
Take my tongue, take my torment, take my hand and don't let go.
Let me live in your life,
for you make it all seem to matter;
Let me die in your arms,
so the vision may never shatter...
The seasons roll on;
my love stays strong.

In the no-go zone.

Lost myself in the blank mass of fog,

Slumped in doorways
And mouthing cold air -
I have heard this.

The streets are half-dead,
All the good folk asleep in their beds,
It's so easy to go off the rails
When the fog spores
Are breeding inside by head.

Fogwalking: the neck muscles tense
Fogwalking: it's right here inside me,

And my brain of blood
Like Billy Budd

And my lungs suck useless air

Like paraplegic dancers
In format
Ion team

Hidebound in it's movements,
Contemplating answers
That could break my bonds
To be half wrong
Would be, in me, improvement
But my comprehensive faculties are impaired

And it seems absurd, but now all I've heard
Fades in empty words and is worthless
As the Human Laugh rocks the cenotaph
But the joke is half-true, and mirthless

Trying to trace a reason
From the spinning words
But all I've heard
Seem at odds with their meanings,
Phonetically pleasing
But delivered in such haste
That in their place
My mind commences screaming

On the verge of belief I crash onto the reef
And a cynical thief steals my senses,
So I cling to the pew with dimensions askew,
And recognition refuses present tenses

All the lives of the saints demonstrate that my faint
Is a minor complaint, but the end is
Nowhere in sight,
Why can't I find me a way to go?
I don't want to die in the nave,
But I know it may be with me some day
So I've got to find a way I can save up
My energies, and find a cause to pray
So something for something
To which I can give my creed
I'd gladly succumb to the wave,
If I thought the water taught a way to light,
I'd gladly succumb, I'm not brave,
And it's easy to believe what the preacher says
Except for the conflict raging between my head
And my brain

I don't want to die, but just the same
Some day
Waiting for that moment
That I know will come
When I'll have to run
And find another sermon
Every man and Norman
And the talking priest
Still, I am at least
Holding all the doors open
Inside me all outside is shared
As the cracked bells peel, it all seems unreal
But the seventh seal stays unbroken
And the Offertory plate tenders no escape
Still I refuse to scrape up a token
Of esteem for these false
Alleyways of the course
I must try to divorce sense from sensing

Clutch vacant laughter

On the window after rain
A past that lives
If only for the present...
Which is gone and will never come again

Turned away, mine say
'Do you? Did you? How?'

Slides away the day
Shows what was
And makes what is now

suddenly didn't seem to matter at all.
Should I sing sad farewell to things

Peter Hammill,"Four pails of water and a bag full of salts.
That is all we are, that is all a man comprises,
Chemicals alone, with no spirit, soul or ghost -
Nothing so bizarre.
No amount of faith disguises 
What is true is what we fear the most

Nothing can survive
Save the things men leave behind them.
Any other case would be really too absurd -
If thoughts remained alive
Surely modern science would find them?
No, the soul is nothing but a word.

All the wonders Man achieves
Emerge from cerebral tissue.
Chemical reactions' ebb and surge
Form that Thing that is you....
It's a sad philosophy,
But better sad than wrong.
Face the truth instead:
When you're dead you're dead,
When you're gone you're gone...
Now she's gone.

Four pails of water and a bag full of salts.
That is all she was, all my lover represented -
That sounds just as mad as saying she will never die.
Fools may clutch at straws
But truth must not be circumvented:
As the tree falls, so must that tree lie!

Now that sounds so odd...
Once I would have preached it brightly.
Now questions appear I rationally can't ignore...
Nothingness or God,
Which of them seems more unlikely?

Once I would have answered clearly,
Now I only think I'm nearly sure.",Four Pails,1986
Peter Hammill,"Beside the pool of clear water
Fed by a secret spring, your lips are sealed
But in your body language
Angels sing
I swear on the Bible
Swear on the sacred and profane

I think I'm drowning in the vortex
Your eyes contain
Your secret face
Show me your secret face
With stars and moon light for shelter

Your breathing close in my ear
The wind is whispering a mystery
For me to hear
Your secret name
Tell me your secret name

Tell me your secret name
Let me drink from the well of secrets
Pluck the fruit from the tree
And feel your secret world envelop me

At the count of three
If I get my hands on one of those

Peter Hammill,"Citadel reverberates to a thousand voices, now dumb,
What have we become? What have we chosen to be?
Now, all history is reduced to the syllables of our name,
Nothing can ever be the same now the Immortals are here.
At the time, it seemed a reasonable course
To harness all the force of life without the threat of death,
But soon we found
That boredom and inertia are not negative,
But all the law we know 
And dead are Will and words like survival.

Arrival at immunity from all age, all fear and all end,
Why do I pretend? Our essence is distilled
And all familiar taste is now drained
And though purity is maintained it leaves us sterile,
Living through the millions of years,
A laugh as close as any tear,
Living, if you claim that all that entails is
Breathing, eating, defecating, screwing, drinking,
Spewing, sleeping, sinking ever down and down
And ultimately passing away time
Which no longer has any meaning.

Take away the threat of death
And all you're left with is a round of make-believe,
Marshal every sullen breath
And though you're ultimately bored by endless ecstasy
That's still the ring by which you hope to be engaged
To marry the girl who will give you forever,
That's crazy, and plainly
It simply is not enough.

What is the dullest and bluntest of pains,
Such that my eyes never close without feeling it there?
What abject despair demands an end to all things of infinity?
If we have gained, how do we now meet the cost?
What have we bargained, and what have we lost?
What have we relinquished, never even knowing it was there?

What chance now of holding fast the line,
Defying death and time
When everything we had is gone?
Everything we labored for and favored more
Than earthly things reveals the hollow ring
Of false hope and of false deliverance.

But now the nuptial bed is made,
The dowry has been paid,
The toothless, haggard features of Eternity
Now welcome me between the sheets
To couple with her withered body, my wife.

Hers forever,
Hers forever,
Hers forever

When you taught me how to say

To the sunny side of the street

And that happy tune is your step

With those blues on parade

Peter Hammill,"Wash your hands clean
Don't let anybody see the dirty work
Keep those secrets locked away from sight forever
Hidden safely where your darker side still runs berserk

So much stored-up resentment
All that background fallout from so long ago
It's still here to haunt you in a trunk locked in the attic

Are the clothes that dressed the actions
You discarded but you can't outgrow
There's a false wall in the basement
Where you hide away the history you dare not put on show

And when the hammer
Hits the nail upon the thumb
Then the unvarnished truth is what you stumble on

On your best behavior
Keep on playing out the lily white
But you'll always be stuck there
Going round and round in circles

The mistakes which you repeat
Form up the framework
Which defines your life

You couldn't quantify the depths you'd have to plumb
Or the damage you've collaterally done
Still, your own footprints are the tracks you stumble on

And it's less by design than by random occurrence
That you filled up your time, that you built up the current
To spark the life you've led, the person you've become
With the end in sight the excuses are all gone

The truth is, this conclusion's
What you've stumbled on
Behind you lies the wreckage
That you've stumbled from

Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

It's tempered all my vanity and glory.
For all that's inexcusable,
I want to tell you that I'm sorry.

Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2013

It's the only children's song that we've ever encountered 
That contains all three of the basic elements of every single children's song. 
The first element is simplicity, so that the child can understand the song. 
The second element is pathos, to prepare the child for later traumatic experiences. 
And the third element is repetition, to give the child a false sense of security"".

But maybe its a question of how much you really want

Had enough?
Had enough?
There's plenty more where that came from now

Your feeling bored,
Swallowed up

Just before the rain came down
The sun came out at last
And as for all assumptions made
And questions never asked

I know, we're not what I promised you we'd be by now

Will you stay?
Here, stay around
And we'll both start
Working this out

But it's not just this
It's everything
You're so hard to reach
And impossible to really read
When your talking with
Two tongues in your mouth
And I wish you'd quit this muttering
Beneath your breath
It's killing me
You've not said nothing yet

Who's talking now?
Well I guess I'm starting to doubt
Are we lost here?
Are you keeping count?
Are you gonna just let me down?

Well your hearts not in it
It's everywhere
It's plain to see
You're still wondering
What's underneath
You're so curious
It's two strikes and you're out
And I'm tiring of this attitude
How you fall to pieces
Like you do

To take a knife and hack away at it
You keep saying, well that's the last time
You'll pretend to, stand aside no matter what we did
I'm not playing, 

All in all then just enough to
Keep us sliding back to where we were

I'm not waiting

Will tell you that you walked away with it

You're out there caring somewhere

So what's the verb to
Kick it off to
Take the time and walk away from it
I'm not playing,
That'll never sit with us well
We're far too pious to get out of it
And we're on our way

And I can't make this make sense
Your thoughts are lost to me now
I cannot take it I'm out
I'm stuck here killing myself
You're out there drinking somewhere

This time I've lost all my hope
I cannot take it no more
I'm stuck here killing myself
You're out there laughing somewhere

I'll tear my heart out no more
I'll burn this bridge till its gone
I'm stuck here killing myself
You're out there laughing somewhere
All joy is lost to me now

Peter Keane,"The guilty undertaker sighs,
The lonesome organ grinder cries,
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way,
I wasn't born to lose you.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad, 
Honey, I want you.

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep,
They wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask me to 
Open up the gate for you.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now all my fathers, they've gone down
True love they've been without it.
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don't think about it.

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid.
She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her.
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see.
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter. 
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
He spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I wasn't very cute to him,
Was I?
But I did it, though, because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I . . .

I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always

We'll have magic in the making

Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye,1995

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2009

That to me is what your eyes are,

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1984
Peter Kingsbery,"That was the beginning
An almost perfect match
That would never come apart
I was a dreamer
A poet from the past
But every word came from my heart
I might have been precious
I might have been tough
I could have been meaner then
Or just a little rough
But I would have died for you
And that was a different man

Forever and ever
All ahead full
Of these days I have no regrets
So wild and abandoned
Deep under your spell

And had nothing to lose
I might have cried easier

I still can make you laugh

 This dirty game
 I see my arms start to open
 I feel my heart want to hold them
 I know that I'll never be the same
 I want a kiss
 I want to do a dance
 I want to live
 I want to lay down and raise up
 And feel like I can start again

 No sentimental nights left to haunt me
 In my sleep

A coups de pourquoi

Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes, that I love so much
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand

If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Oh, I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If it might have kept me by your side

If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

Please don't go away!",If You Go Away,1967

And I could make it stay

Would always be
There'd be no coming day
No morning light above
To make me realize our love
Is over

And now you walk away from me
And there's no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that comes to warm the land
I watch you walk away somehow
I have to let you go now
It's over

It's too late to tell you how I feel
Our love was real
And yet, there are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over

And so I walk away and turn my collar to the wind
I walk along in silence trying not to think at all
I put my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This love we shared would always be
There'd be no coming day

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley
In Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

Call him drunkin' Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war

They battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war 

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored;
Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when do the Indians dance

Call him drunken Ira Hayes 
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died early drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was the grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",The Ballad of Ira Hayes,1994

Peter Lawford,"I'm just a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I'm just a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.
Raindrops have brought us together and that's what I longed to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
So I'll be the fella, the fella with an umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I met a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I met a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Waiting for the skies of blue to turn into skies of gray.
Raindrops will bring us together and that's what I long to see.
Maybe a break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
I told the fella, the fella with the umbrella,
I could be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.",A  Fella With an Umbrella (Easter Parade),2012
Peter Leitch,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?

Peter Leitch,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Peter Leitch,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1988
Peter Leitch,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1991
Peter Leitch,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Peter Leitch,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Peter Leitch,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Peter Leitch,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1992
Peter Leitch,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1995
Peter Leitch,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1995
Peter Leitch,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
