Artie Bernstein,"It's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong

And now he's poppin' the piano just to raise the price
Of a ticket to the land of the free
Well, he say his home's in Frisco where they send the rice
But it's really in Tennessee

That's why he said, ""I need someone to love me
Need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there
Oh, I need someone to lend me a fifty dollar bill and then
I'll leave Hong Kong behind me for happiness once again""

Won't somebody believe
I've a yen to see that Bay again?
But when I try to leave
Sweet opium won't let me fly away

I need someone to love me
Need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there

That's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong",Hong Kong Blues,1993
Artie Bernstein,"One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.
You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.
You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.
Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.",The Old Music Master,1996
Artie Bernstein,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001

Artie Butler,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

All their hopes
All their dreams

Artie Glenn,"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a way",Crying in the Chapel,1999
Artie Kane,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1972
Artie Malvin,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When/Speech,1995
Artie Malvin,"To the tables down at Mory's
To the place where Louie dwells
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well
Sing the Whiffenpoofs assembled with their glasses raised on high
And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last
Then we'll pass and be forgotten with the rest

We're poor little lambs who have lost our way

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A garden of Eden, just made for two

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer show'are is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you.

Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon 
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
No matter, darling Where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Why it is so
That this longing for you 
Follows wherever I go.
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

Artie Malvin,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade In Blue,2013

Artie Malvin,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Artie Shaw,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1989
Artie Shaw,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say ""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí

I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over

Artie Shaw,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Artie Shaw,"Castles were crumbling and daydreams were tumbling
December was battling with June
But on this bright afternoon
Guess I'll be changing my tune
Kept on despairing beyond any caring
If I jumped out of a balloon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for? 

Wanted a permit to make me a hermit
To grumble and glare at the moon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny

Artie Shaw,"Wishes and hopes are the tiny silk ropes to which we attach our dreams.
Tie up a few and I'm certain that you will begin to achieve your schemes.

""Look for the spark of your faith in the dark and that spark will light up your way""

I believe, I believe, I believe in wishing wells
And I also believe in a lot of things, things the daisy tells.
I believe, I believe that a four-leaf clover brings,
Lots of luck, lots of joy, lots of happiness,

And when it's Christmas I believe in Santa Claus,
Why do I believe? I guess I believe because

I believe, I believe, I believe that dreams come true.

Don't tell the wish or you'll break the spell.

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Steals across the meadows of my heart

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own

Bésame igual que mi boca te besó

Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di

Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""

I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí

Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky

But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

Its theme is a kiss and a sigh

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine

You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Verse One: El Da Sensai

c'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck and, the beat's bound to pound
We're strollin through the industry be	, see we gotta be
the next shit that kicks, cause brothers ain't got it
In this rap shit, ain't no time for the dilly-dally
pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids were jealous for the props
See the shit never stops Hobbes, just lookin for my dillz-knot
Styles we make, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
Notified that, the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back
Now, the flip tripper ripper slits ya wit da mixture
All crews, who never paid dues, watch it 'fore I get ya
Cause nowadays, it's da ways, of the underground
but they're wack now, so c'mon wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Two: Tame One

You know the stacks, if not, then ask some niggaz who heard of me
The half on the Artifacts of Jersey
Cause brothers be buggin not givin love to the nuccas
Sayin fuck us, cause we be shinin brighter than the suckers
Shootin me prison nobody listens to your dissin
Cause yo my shit's legit and as a lyricist I'm hittin
the high note, so why don't, I smile when I take pictures
Cause now that I rock I got more niggaz on my jock than bitches
I just want to do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin rappers don't even like us
But props due, peep The Source RapPages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin your jaws
I freak techniques, cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks talk junk, Tame and the Sensai leave em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Three: MC El, Tame One

Hold up, you rap sucker duck, buck, the track's rough enough
to prove a point, that the niggaz is the joint
Magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
I got the Heavy Ammunition 'cause I'm Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggaz, can't believe the Artifacts achieve
Got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
Yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itchin from the shit that I'm scriptin
So pass the baton, to the next runner up, Tame
I give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

Aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, I drop bombs, but since
our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin others rock and clock we shocked em like a robot
with our props, so now the Notty Head Niggaz got more knots yo
My pockets are lumpy chump, my drunk style is trunky dunk
My disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
'cause I'm comin from the underground I'm down wit da git down
MC's who used to diss us, get pissed cause they ain't shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin slept, are dead because we keep on
peepin these weak MC's, who cheese with their bologny
Cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off a tow truck
So yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down

And to the stores that'll sell three Phillies for a dollar
To Afrika Bambaata for makin me a rap scholar
And MC El for rhymin with this notty headed lunatic
You always knew we had the crew that had the mad drama kid
peep it, all my peeps from 12 Block to Broad Street
And backstreets in Jersey where the niggaz first heard me
It took a long time comin with more cuts than Jason

I do +Poetic Justice+, like Janet played the role
And now I'm makin suckers swoll with the dynamite soul

	but the track's got ?, and rhymes got the knack
	See, we'll never fall we got support from the fam
	Jam after jam, here we are but there we stand
	It took mad time, but here we is, in the music business
	Press record when you hear me on KISS
	Brothers talk shit, but yo, who really cares?
	Tame's who all I need 'cause, the brother's right there

Boom Skwad in the house

I lower da boom when I do the cypher dance
With naps and saggy pants as I romance the plants
I take puffs on stuff, rough enough to give a buzz
To my 'cause, even though he don't touch the stuff
See this blunt in my front, some say might stink
But yo the skunk helps me think
I'm a boom smoker joker with the knack because I'm gifted
Some say misfit, but fuck it let's get lifted
I get a box of 50, get nifty with a spliff G
And tick tackle new jacks who tried to diss me
I walk through the rain for dimes at the sess spot
Not hot with cops, cause I'd hate to get popped
I'm a terror to a trey bag, son you'll soon see
But I gots to get, higher, lower the boom G

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ahh, I just catch the fumes
I consume, bend the room, with the ? tune
Spark another L for the cypher
Sit back and light the, five inch adventure that's alrighta
Lower the boom, for the sess bags thicker
One's a flight to Phillie, while the other one's the liquor
Off to the weed spot, the bags better be fat
Or else you catch the speed knot, and holmes you don't need that
Spark the indo or the L, sniff the weed
But I never get splits mista cause Tame's been hip ta
The baby of the blunts, so I'm down to catch the contact
Here's the rap chat, it's a fact that I react
Smooth from the boom consumed a zoom zoom a zoomin
MC El the leaner cleaner thoughts dials tune-in
Into, the matter roll the blunt bunt batter
Pass the shit quick, don't flip, with the chit chatter
I never puckered once, my lungs got jammed
My man said it wouldn't kill, but I choke, god damn
The sess starts to cloud the room
The Artifacts, commences ta, lower the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ohh I hope I live to see the day they make it legal
To all the people can't see what I'm smokin ain't evil
Stop callin me a pusher cause I take pulls and take tokes
Cut snakes, cut breaks, and I hate fake folks
So pass the cheeba senorita cause I need a
Fat fuckin Phillie just before I funk a freaker
Creatin from the milk crate with hooks and riffs
I can lift em, and shift em makin jams like this
With the blunt in my left hand and the Phillie in my pocket
MC El, at my right, with the mic so I can rock it
Sess makes my eyes red, but shades only cost three bills
In Hooterville, so I'm chill
See the bigger the blunt, is how I feel about my indo
Because my moms would never throw my shit out the window
I puff herb til noon, chill and watch cartoons
Yes once again, I lowered the boom

Are you weeded?  Nope see, I'm doper for the session
Catchin wreck, check the tec, cause I'm sober for the sketch
If I'm caught smokin blunts, I catch a bad one from my clan see
I'm higher than a messiah so you know I'm handy dandy
Legalize it holmes cause the zone's gettin bigger
From the whites, to the Ricans, cause they learned it from the niggaz
So who's the first to kick it real, for the, cypher
Eight Phillies so you know you gots to pass the other lighter
Pass the incense gents, it smells out in the hall
My groupies think I'm stunnin cause I'm six feet tall
No need for the sheepa cheeba cleaner than, Beaver Cleaver
Though I'm down to pitch, with my skit like Tom Seaver
Either, or my jaw speak of true features
I must be, the freaker of this doper class teacher
So pass the Visine, so you can keep your eyes clean
Look to Looney Tunes, we lowered, the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Lower da boom.
Spark that blunt
Lower da boom, ya got to lower da boom.
Spark that blunt, represent, don't front.

Artifacts, check around my fuckin BLOCK, I X-Men like Cyclops

But as is, my ad-libs, are more wicked than bad kids
Ask Biz if Tame leaves marks like a shit skid

It's the Mister, on a mission mixer of the rougher
Mix the snuff that get you up ? but no style is tougher
I dismiss crews, I bruise, snooze ya losin
Groovin provin I can do in men who went out smoother

Tracks be fat so who dat?  Nigga I be through black

I get biz on bitches, puff izz with my cousins
Tame shit so wild, honies roll they eyes like Teddy Ruxpin
I hit mad skins, then roll up bills on the reals
My skills mad ill, but chill kid, everything's real
from naps up top, down to the wrinkles in my Reeboks
I'm up late like Leno playin demos from my toolbox
My crew rocks, two blocks away from the buddha spot
I'm out but don't get it fucked up, cause I wsnt you to rock

[El Da Sensai]
I come from the slums of New Jeruz I do bums
who can't adapt no haps son, you know I close on caption

but I fly zones, and shine like chrome, on 7:35
I, play my Hi-Fi, volume up sky high
Talkin buddha thai, don't bother tryin to fascinate my eye
I got 20/20 like Baba Wawa on a Friday
Buy my tape, so I can put a Cruiser in my driveway
Say hi Tame, pass the dutch so I can take a puff
of Born Cypher Cypher Master, I never get enough
No curls, no braids, peasy heads still get paid
Smokin sassy-frassy, that grows free, in the Everglades
and get lit, trip up on the phone and talk some sex shit
But that's some next shit, yo peace I'm out to the exit

It's the funky Mister Ripper split your ass
Quick-fast, you never outlast the outcast
I'm stompin weak-ass niggaz, so ready let's go
I gas up a skit, I got the snaps on the petrol
I'm never fake I break the funk breaks I'm breakin
MC El create the styles that brothers ain't makin
To go past the end I run you over like a semi
Remember I be the guy, who's fuckin up your shit I,
be the one to call myself def in any program
Scan my battleplan before I step into a jam

What goes on?
What goes on baby what goes on? (7X)

[El Da Sensai]
What goes on girl, you riff and you riff about
Brothers callin you a bitch, but tell me would you switch
Into shame, how one dame, can make a name for all
I guess it's like that when all the chips fall
It's critical stereotypical how they diss you
It ain't you that chill cause you know your status is true
Girls be trickin, on a mission listen what's it for?
All you get is people dissin callin you a whore
But I guess you don't stress it cause you just keep goin
Hoein and hoein thinkin you're sinkin kids for dough and
At the same time you whine how we call you this
Or that, it beez that way, givin me no play
Kickin facts and all that, diss em about the schisms
Who riff, when brothers call em hoe or a bitch
And if you think we're wrong, give me a gong, word is bond
And all I gotta ask is what goes on?

[Artifacts]
What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[Tame One]
I call em as I see em
Steamin on the scheamin as I kick this
Fitness with the quickness bout the gutter snipe type bitches
Flippin like switches and don't be knowin niggaz pedigree
You better be ready, I like +Sleepin With the Enemy+
My remedy is any G, fuck em and flee
I shoot the breeze at the skeeze, just because +The P is Free+
Don't try to play me baby yo, you must be crazy
Tryin to fade me with no clippers when I know you got some other niggaz
Just keep it real, word is bond we'll get along fine
I know that you're on mine, I peeped it for a long time
High saditty bitties, that's out for the price tag
? get bagged, and be the victim of a right jab
So if you walk like a bitch, talk like a bitch, it's on
But what goes on?

What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[El Da Sensai]
You in a relationship? Aight, well cool, we can do this
We start with a kiss and go right down the list
Analyze this, check it how we always spend time
Hittin all spots, bend it up every time
I give you what you want, even more if you ask
Just a small task, any spell you cast
But on the down low, you're hittin that bro, doin the same thing
Skeezin, but what's the reason for the treason?
That's why you're left all alone and you say we're wrong
Sing the song along, tell me what goes on?

[Girl]
This shit here, this is bullshit (hold up hold up hold up)
This is notty for a girl got gats too (I'm sayin)
All you hear now is bitch this bitch that

What the fuck is goin on? (the fuck you want from me? yo)

[Tame One]
Don't catch offense when the gents call you names
If you ain't one, don't sweat it hon, it's just one of them thangs
In my slang, unless you catch a fit from hearin bitch
If the shoe fits, then wear it, I'm not dissin for the ?, get it
Not every girl's a bitch, yeah that's true
Like my Ma Dukes, but oh yes, the rest I seem to talk to
Are shady and not really the ladies they claim to be
It's crazy, everywhere I go, it seems the same to me
That's up until I'm gone
But on the way home I'm still thinkin, what goes on?

",What Goes On,1994
Artifacts,"[El Da Sensai]
I calculate that eighty-five was the year
I first grabbed the pen, daydreamin of the cheers
Ahead from rockin shows, no Girbauds that sag
The windbreaker suits and backspins that was mad
I stress progress roll joints at my rest
til the ill wee hours, and I knew it was the best
I hit mad spots, many crews got dropped
While I was gettin props niggaz was dealin on the block
Stayin in crib on the weekends was Marley Marl
was freakin the cuts Mr. Magic was speakin
That's how I got my first taste, makin tapes
til the rhyme skill was great and my style would escalate
Practice made my perfect tactics
Now my dap gets clap, cause I'm the rap snap fanatic
But now in nine-trey I got the T-Ray track
And my trunks, my roots are growin styles from whayback

..

[Tame One]
I flash back to fat Kangol hats, with plastic
Back when steppin on kicks in eighty-six got your ass kicked
Bombers and sheepskins, were common when I first started rhymin
Still I found time to go bombin
Me and my pals rocked Cazals with no glass
Dark flavored Clarks, Lee Denims off the ass
Back when Mr. Magic had it goin all the way on
the beat with BDP, added flavor like a crayon
Indeed MC's would represent with the skills
But now in ninety-three a lot of them can get the dillz
It seems like a little sumthin missin in the mix
But now I got a deal, so it's up to me to fix
When niggaz put me up on, with funky raps to cut on
Word is BOND, if I hear another wack rap song
I might snap and it's an actual fact
that I'ma kick it like that, cause this is strictly bout the whayback

..

[El Da Sensai]
Aww man damn, whayback, things was kinda fat
Had the Godfather knot, a Starter hat, things are kinda wack
now, packed up, my cardboard and stepped away
I didn't have a choice, the culture was slayed
B.D. had died, and things were dissapearin
The West coast was here and all these wack beats appearin
DJ's were breakin down record store doors
to get the Biz Dance and the Chante Moore's
Peace to Buck Four, Rocksteady on the floor
New York and Dynamic crews plus many more
Remember the time when you didn't pack a nine
Niggaz just came to hear some, funky ass rhymes
But all of that's over, cause brothers want to act up
No clubs to go to, they'll just pack rap up
That's how the media wants it to stop
So peep the verse and last showin of Graffiti Rock
So check it, the brothers want to wreck it
To get what's expected, cause hip-hop, should be respect
Gotta get it back, to get it on track
Artifacts kickin styles illy on the whayback

[Tame One]
Like back when my Timberlands were only size sixes
I used to take pictures shootin spitballs at bitches
Cross New Jersey Transit just to see a rapper kick it
But now I ain't with it, cause niggaz just ain't worth the ticket
Shit man, I remember jams that were slammin
Gettin me and my man in, was harder than backgammon
DJ's would scratch back to back from boom baps
And rappers with real raps, could drop shit real fat
But now kid, as I recollect, rappers out who caught wreck 
respected, just got stuck up in my tape deck
Real deal hip-hop, when Biz used to flip-flop
His fat ass, on stage'd do a dance, in busted Reeboks
Niggaz musta forgot, when real rhymes was hot
Cause now if you ain't gold, you ain't got no props
But fuck that, I'm above that, I don't play that
The Artifacts staff drops math about the whayback

Artifacts,"My off the hook look, leaves my competitors shook
No matter what groups you book, I still jam like Sam Cooke
Took a whole click out, and had the soundman flippin
kickin wicked freestyle to shit on niggaz with the writtens

Check my computer type graphics, niggaz get they ass kicked
quick if they try to flip like ashes, I'm
never passive, as is, yo you see the flow yo what happened
Check out them niggaz rappin

The clap of the crowd be showin me love like Cupid
Loop it back, shit slams like I dished off to Shaq
My crew stay strapped with battle raps on cap
We ready to clap on chaps who make up half you sucker rap acts

I'm intact with facts, MC's can't compete with these treats
And Shawn J P. with the beats, unleash
talents, balance, styles extra-ordinary
with the vocabulary, no other buries

We know schematics on rapper's theatrics
Only a few can freak status, Artifacts techniques
can freak from here to Dalls, leavin you to clean up
like Alice, shit's thick like smoke from out the chalice
The weak we em-barr-ass, showin no pity on your city
We either play you live or have you taped in like MIDI (who)
The Brick City Committee comin through a nigga soundset
This round's for all our niggaz that didn't get down yet

        Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
        From off the back of the bus, the 31 Bumrush
        Crews we breeze through, you don't know, you need to
        tell the soundman, don't touch nothin but the EQ

Deafenin, lethal weapon steppin with the props
Seekin through your sale racks and peepin all mall cops
In to win, tall like, Paul Bunyan, the bass line's drummin
Meanin that the Notty Headed Nigguz comin

Lights, camera!  Act like you want to bring the dra-ma
I make it hotter than all of Atlanta, ready to act up
My Hooterville upbringin is swingin upon ya son
Gunnin for your under the name of Tame One

Yo, eyes focused, lips ready to toke it
You'll choke on my skit, your dilemma is to quit
flip scripts, who's the winner takin out all beginners
in an instant, my style's polished and stain resistant

The E&J sipper blunt ripper nigga flips your bitch ass
With better effects, we go to war like George Lu-cas
Toucan Sam and we be the Mister Man simply put
Your twelve inch could barely make a foot
We got bombs, my momma told me no when I was younger
but I told her, ""I don't cry on no shoulders I'm a soldier""
Let me show ya, how we can rock a crowd like Ayatollah
Check the folder (here we go check it out right now)

Now you got the scoop, check the Guess troop low
On the chest, niggaz still use the word fresh blessed
You see the structure, builder, constructer
Bust a, nother with the skills that I muster
Up touche you check the rhyme forte

Gettin' blunted off somebody's hoe money
Honies beepin' for me for cheese, ease back, please keep that weave intact
Best believe that Tamer D'll be back
Get the weed sacks relax, fuck a flick from Blockbuster
I'ma touch ya, provin' who got the bomb like Russia
Friendly neighborhood rap hood, with goods
Could it be?  Yes, no question
Now let's start up the session
Kick a rap out til I black out, check out when I wreck out
Throwin' backs out, laughin' out loud when niggaz crap out
Me I want more G's than the LAPD
From when I wrote my first rhyme in eighty-three
With each speech released I reach mad blocks
Analyzin' more spots than Matlock
Now I got this rappin' shit on padlock
You only half-rock, my shit returns like resurrections
In religion, was fuckin' with the fact we only bullshittin'

One two, yo
Start takin' notes, statin all quotes
Niggaz couldn't see me through an optometrist scope
Open, by the rhythm MC's that's hardest
New Jerusalem, Artifacts be the oddest
Main target, crews who think they bringin' the news
Who's this?  Kickin in your Benz why box crisp

As long as the Boom Skwad is hearing me clear
There ain't another rapper here that's gonna G this year (yeah)
Lyric for lyric we exhibit mass appeal
Stayin' Real like Erick Sermon, drunk off the funk like it was bourbon
Rollin up Big Willie like Suburban, Blazers make a wager
Tamer blows up like a pager
Makin' you wake up early, tell your girlie turn my tape up
Wait up, let me lace up the place like boots
Make loot, and Proceed to rock like Roots
I tear the roof off, and when I fuck don't take my boots off
I shoot from the lip, and make your nose glow like Rudolph
You soft, so let me hit you off with all the hardness
Artifacts shit, we got the hard shit regardless

Many ask how I be makin' up my shit
Like the format and how it don't match or fit
I just, dig into the X-Files of styles
Hittin' while you're missin' I'll prove that the child
Be on the different angles strangle those who want to tangle
With the, Flexi With the Technique ripper
El the, Sensai what the men say in the back?
Thinkin' that we can't battle rap in combat
Cease that, realize that the Facts don't mess
Around when we bless sounds down for any test

If I had it my way, every wack MC would die Friday
Makin Saturday a better day
Sunday wouldn't start your week off til Monday
One day tunes I wrote yesterday will be tomorrow's scriptures for today
At high noon, Boom Skwad Gods with knowledge
Holler at apostles, who squalor in despair, despisin those who follow
Swallowin pride like St. Ide's while you stare... take a drink
Don't think in a eyeblink I won't start my hijinks
and hijack a flight [Yeah right, when?]
Tomorrow night, cause off the record with the treble and the bass
I chase my lyrics through the rap race
Last place is simply not an option in my case
Waste not want not because I front not
The Notty keeps his lyrical shotty cocked
and locked up at your temple, over instrumentals
(""It's all in your mind"") you No. 2 like the pencil
The Boom Skwadron, Godson, who got the Bop Gun
The top gun, from the jump like Datsun
I got one, candy-coated rote rhymes skits I shit on when I get on
Then flip the scripts like I had Zips on
It's on like electrical, my symmetrical
alphabetic keeps my competition ridin on my testicles
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit, ain't nobody shit"")
You to the rescue, let me test you
Who the best crew, most definite
has to be the Skwad cause I'm the President
All you misrepresenters with your twelve inches need pinches
Wake the fuck up and check out what this is
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit, your momma ain't shit, ain't nobody shit"")
I can't see nuttin but victories
MC's think they can get to me, then bring it
Cause once I pass the blunt to my Lieutenant then we in it
For the infinite, no play play
The notty headed Newark nigga from NJ and the Sensai
represent fully, playin bullies out for yappin
Thinkin you'll be rappin, get tapped and say you scrappin
While I been waitin hatin fake MC's that make they bacon
with passion, rippin up they stickers for reaction
Practicin on rap has-beens, I'm down with the Biz like Backspin
Dissin Mikes like the Jacksons
Thick like the lips on that Fugee chick
Hard like the dicks in booty flicks
Dissin niggaz like a snooty bitch (trick)
I only pop a coochie if it smells Gucci
Get the lucci hit it for months and then smoke blunts with the hoochies
(""What's the flavor Dunn"" - Tame)
You know the flavor like blue cheese
on how I make crews bleed and school MC's who try to do me

(""He ain't shit, you ain't... ahh motherfucker"")
        ""Do me baby, do me baby""
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit..."")
        ""bom ba zi, it ain't over motherfuckers""

My characteristics be mistic, you ask who is it
doin it, with the next type of tecs running through it
The bullshit, I mean, rap style clean
while I lean my 6 foot frame, Tame's the other being
Seeing that niggas wack, time to take it back to basics
Like saucony sneakers or a pair of Asics
Don't hate this- analyst, hip hop activist
battle tecnician who be on a mission now listen

[Tame One]
Tame One got more grip than gore tex
I'm comin through your set like CBS 
writing my name up in your projects
Who want to test me when I'm sess-ted
Pushing the paragraph like it's a Lexus
I come off hot like Texas
My west disrtict predicts that I'm the shit
So I walk through the bricks and shoot the gif like it's a full fifth
I bring the ruckus filling dutches with dust
I spread love like Take 6 until the whole spliff bust

[El]
We wish to diminish MC frauds who need to check
into a rap clinic, thinking that they all in it
My message to those is right down to the core
kick your best MC and all his niggas through the door
3-point offense, defense level's high
Stamina a hundred, leave your team ass dry

[Tame]
It's still our nature to hate ya
play you out like Las Vegas
cause my crew's got more game than 16 Segas
with adaptors, battling wack rappers and actors for all their stacks
and keeping my family fucked up like the Jacksons

[El]
Yo, you couldn't find my dap if you tried to use a map
or instructions, the number ones sold, guns be bustin so
Best to recognize, eyes is on the prize
watching for spies who want a piece of the lyrical pie

[Tame]
Crews be flippin like they really want to die
but when I ease up, they freeze and can't look me in the eye
I got folders on the jokers who talk trash
They never walk past, cause I be checkin for they're hall pass
Haul ass and let me shine like glass do
when I die make a statue, I get in you like a tattoo
I pay homage to all the bombers that I'm fly with 
enduring politics and getting paid off of some side shit

[El]
I push niggas back who lack skills to hold their own
Jackin other brothers' styles way  that they can zone
Prone to dismantle your insides like Mickey Mantle
My form lasts long, like trick candles
You see the work of these rhyme experts
that hurt niggas in cyphers to make the other states liver
Survivors of the fittest light the graf then ASCAP
Sen-S-E-I peep the next paragraph

[Tame]
In all actu-al my style's wilder than a crack spot
I'm illin, using the putas you buildin as my backdrop
I paint a picture perfect with a thousand pencils
From the back of Continentals, Lincolns, drinkin, thinkin mental
You better look through your girl's tape collection
cause this next subject might have a nigga second-guessing
I want to do raps and get fat like Apache
so I can get nasty and dis a nigga like a taxi

[El]
My exquisite exhibit has facts in this specific
Most niggas boast how they represent and come with it
But whose the rudest boys, coolest with poise
Artifacts be stickin them with rhythm poise
Is on the biz, taylor skills like Liz
Tryin to save the culture, vultures want to run the biz
You hear my voice more clear, intact
peep the lyrics, trap my sectrets
Ill like the film called the Curor
Questions, answers, brothers payin dues

Antagonist with scripts, be from the Bricks perfect
There's no denying that you're spying -- trying to see the graph
but you're knowing that can't fuck with the mathe-matcian

Jerks get down, cause they know we hurt the sound
So ease as I please these OG's with seeds that

My theoretical medical rhetoric is terrible, but bearable
Instead of sheddin wool, I'm takin sedatives
MC repetatives, think they competetive
but I'm the Exodus, of executing
all of my et ceteras, my Book of Revelations
speak of hesitation, but I got the longest lines
in Newark since Club Sensations
Haitians, request me on the station like I'm Lauryn
But if I ain't touring there ain't no rapper on the street scorin
(word up) and that's word to my moms

Chorus: Artifacts

Smokin blunts for information
But you can catch me at the dugout, eatin kennel rations
Rap innovations, causin confrontations
And I got some fast assed styles, so go and chase one
Hah, you lose from takeoff, so break off your shake off
cause here comes the payoff, for Ferris on his Day Off
Hieroglyphic, mystic, misfit rips shit, toxic Mr. Rock

Smartly, advance no chance my lyrics prance upon the tracks

To my, do or die, stature bound to catch ya
Those who try and match the, master not an actor, poseur
Wet with rap caliber, challengers
Wonder how I handle the, dates on my calendar
Using, verbal assault to insult
those who wish to diss the first born is catchin fault
Self taught, not many can say that
So put the needle to the groove and listen to real rap
So I'ma come to a close, it be the pros, y'all know the steez

Artifacts,"[Tame One]
I was out to bomb like Vietnam, but in this rhyme, I'm the prime suspect
Handcuffed for stuff that I ain't hit yet
It seems the neighborhood block watch got open like a box top
Wanted they're props and called up the cops
While Momma Dukes is in the kitchen flippin
Trippin cause spray caps is missin and I left without permission
I got bagged with the darkest black marker I had
An easy target cause my tag is on my bookbag
As I was shadowed they musta heard the bag rattle
Tipped the cops off, and ran up, before I popped the top off
Got interrogated bout crews I never heard of
Got my face wrote on, and treated like I did a murder
Heard sermons, on property value and city workshops
Slapped with a fine, now in my record there's a new notch
The misdemeanor catcher comin back at cha
for the long ride, as we return to the wrongside

[El Da Sensai]
Out to burn, rackin paints by the sack to provide
tracks as we return to the wrongside
Art programs and more hip-hop jams, must arrive
as we return to the wrongside
More better styles and wack writers step aside
Aerosol ride, as we return to the wrongside
Newark, New Jers - Brick City we reside
Big up, to BS, as we return to the wrongside

Once more, we have in store graffiti folklore
in depth to score points, what this joint for?
All graffiti writers, we bring justice, to this
Art we take to heart but they missed
the actual Facts, paint with fat caps, artistic
gestures, flat or gloss be the texture
If you measure the amount or count TV, shows on graf
Galleries, droppin all the skill calories
They crackin down to make us back down
but we still wreckin, who remember King 67?
Peace to Insta, buildin a mad tag in December
Protective shell los for the winter
Get in the subject, on how they say we suspects
Harass me for a marker, there he goes with a Tec
Blind to see wreck, cause they ignorant to check
the true art so, they pass laws just to catch
Certain writers, most bite us anyway
L-S-be	-S, L-T-D is on the path subway
Try to bring an understanding, respect we're demanding
Wrongside tales, we never fail with the plannin

Fatter jams on the air must arrive
The weak can't slide as we return to the wrongside
More joints on tape, less compromise
Better in size as we return to the wrongside

[Tame One]
Toys bite my tags, throwups, and old pieces
Thowin crews up, they can't be down with, and catchin beatings
Me and my crew stay close-knit
Make niggaz say 'Oh shit!' about our dope shit, takin cities in doses
With a tag here and a tag there next year
it'll be everywhere, catch me if you dare
It's rare for me not to have a marker after dark
Cause I've been in this to win this since niggaz used to say spark

[El Da Sensai]
Yo, I got the black book designers and the bag
Make sure I got the uni for the on tour tag
Saying that we cause mad terror in the city
Kids ain't got shit so, we feels no pity
on any surface, hurtin it, experts in it
Create with the Krylon, crafts be fantastic

[Tame One]
Artistic misfits, gifted wicked with the sketchbook
and the paint, maintainin the status top rank
With ink stained hands, I masterpiece master plans
with cans we came across diss some toys who crossed me off
Lost in my thought, I can walk a mile on style it's
been a while but I keep mechanicals on file
for every new jack, and non-believer not knowin my background
from jump, sleepin cause they only see me with blunts
My ghetto cartoons just express how I feel
Representin my culture, and not off it is the deal
I'm so ill with skill and I'm still up to par
Not your everday rap star, just who we are
Like conquering lions, we do our things with strong pride
for the long ride, tellin tales from the wrongside

[El Da Sensai]
KRS keeps the stage show live
Sharper than knives, as we return from the wrongside
PNB Nation, no hesitation
Blazin, as we return from the wrongside
Peeps sleep, while these brothers coincide
Keep in stride, as we return from the wrongside
Comp hide, toy niggaz take a dive
Kickin skills live, as we return from the wrongside

Uhh, it's like that
Layin shit down on the map

like this like that, so whatchu want?

By the time that I'm finished I peel the caps off six Guinness
Skwad Training helps me to peep a sucker's weakness, like
Telling your secrets, or kicking it to your freakses
You couldn't go there with directions
I make crews break out like skin infections from my rap lethal injections

Hoes get caught up in my web like flies
One look at my red eyes, Tricks jump into backflips like Jedis
Black little rascal dissin dips at White Castle
Got love doctors baffled why bitches ride me like a saddle

Is it live or Memorex when I be on deck
Loose from deuce deuces from the neck and then I jet
Et cetera, catch my rap and after that kick back
Competitors could rap, but they recycle like six-packs (robo-nigga)
Wack ain't the word for ya, nigga! I never heard of ya
So turn it down a notch or two or watch my crew murder ya

Yo hold the phone, tone niggas like That's raps are prone
To dissasemble members only who think they're grown

Bear witness, that, we bring the crispiness
Exquisite, prolific, the two that brew the gifted
Or uncanny, playschool the days who misbehave
Pray their handy, MC's wreckin' niggas with the dandy
Style so peep the tech, X be the brand called seb? and
These niggas from New Jerus is next on hand
Formulate rhymes, create lines, collaborate
With the DATs and mind state, that makes your braincells ache
Niggas get dissed in the cut, now they finished
Advantage to the victor all crews be diminished

You will continue rolling your blunts, in a counter-clockwise fashion
(wack MC's, they all get the dick)
Gripping it firmly, yet loosely at the ends, twist it
In a counter-clockwise motion
No cheating, no Easy Wide will be distributed
You will be based to rely your skills on pure instinct

Peep how when I speak I freak sequins
Henceforth I piss MC's off more often, I'm the boss
Hittin' my blunts dipped in secret sauce

Step on competition with my hollow tip cleats
Past the rumors, that, the Artifacts got lazy that's crazy
Makin' joints that make your thoughts hazy

Gassed up like Getti watch me blow spots like Exxon

Cause when I gets em, I'll be fuckin up they system
or temperature cheer when I appear from the mist
priceless, ice-diss and never see another Christmas

You play Risk when you dealin with the New Jeruz two blitz
Without the use of two clips, niggaz styles still be fluid (still)
The cat, darer with the terror off hands (hah!)
Without bands we rock spots in all lands (all lands)
Nigs be playin and we stand for the susbtance
subject's the basement, MC's be patient
Cause all that Russian/rushin save that shit for the dressing

Don't sniff shit but snot hops, you better watch your snotbox
I'll diss you, then I'll clear the air like Scott tissue 
The issue got a barcode on funkmode
So now I pack a trunkload of skunk, for the underground chumps
(Hoo-wee!) Cause I bumps in any system, who dissed em?
Watch me back them up from all the way from New Jeru
to Manhattan (Manhattan) satin and silk, kill the best built
I guess the milk was no good, so now I'm classified a true hood
Check this nigga, live on Kodak tits
or bust a pimp, cause I'm not a boogaloo shrimp

Niggaz play the bench for us, overtime if niggaz want to shine
But I'm, the rhyme don taking out imposters
Proper with these fat tips, practice good posture
Not a, liquor sipper drug-transacter
Rapper-turned-actor nor be a lyrical slackard
Rapper for today's youth, check the attribute
Name Sensai, AOF, make niggaz regroup
Scoop these, ramsacked tracks like jewel thieves
Break it down to the matter cause the chatter's on squeeze

LADIES AND GENTS!!! We represent and take offense
to all the nonsense, here to resurrect like Com Sense
We rhymin fresh, nonetheless, don't stress the messengers
Boucning to the beat like big breastses
After this rap skit, kids go back and practice, lackin this
lyrical tactics when they match wits, who the?
captains over the boom bips
Rippin over the music when I use
just before I black out and I lose it
Able to stable a turntable
Raping record labels for papers, press record, tape us

Verse Two: El Da Sensai

The fly style terrorist, blitzed to fits
Different vocals for the locals tricks for the remix, pick
notes, quote, still fresh when ass-broke
Past Go, when I move rap you in my lasso
Flow, pro-fessional, casual, on point, New
Jersey niggaz with the shit that's natural
Put words into patterns scheme plans for any man who think
He know the time and his rhyme don't stink
We be the ultimate (Ultimate what?)  Plus
Lyrical performance making sense a must
Bust back, with compositions paragraphs on your phonograph
as is, producer credit under Showbiz
That's Them blend lick shot, movin with strategical
lethal, rhyme style, considered unbelievable

Chorus

Verse Three: Tame One

Picture this like it's a cinema flick
We in the midst of taking over this, half of you
crabs don't even notice this, scope this
We know the risk and still take it, we could make it
We've already been the underrated
If I shine I shine, if I brick I just brick
If you diss, we can take it to the curb like dog shit
I'm not in it for the gimmicks, satisfying critics
I just want my own like the Hasidics
Mine on the sidelines, MC's Hail Mary
But I be in the box kicking my commentary
Quick to bury MC crews who lose at my circumfrence
And hit em with the spit I roll my blunts with
It be the ultimate, fuck the dumb shit we run it half-blunted
or crazy drunk off the eight hundred

Artifacts,"[El Da Sensai]
Artifacts be the best in this MC fest
Rest any intentions we here to mention we the fresh
Newark natives, Polo king bringin the zing
to your Walkman, check it how we talk and sing
Breakin that thing, lyrical jackin, mackin
All so-called cypher rappin niggaz I'm smackin
No tricks with fits inflict the hurt like Frank Thomas
To never make the wack jams, to my peers I promise
Atomic, yet, niggaz gonna have to respect
what we're bringin to the table check my dialect
Alphabeta, wetta, than your man who says he can
take a whole block, we put that ass on lock and
Styles be groovy, fake niggaz can't fool me
cause I'm a fly brown brother and you can't school me
Tools be, always sharpened for MC's that be startin
up shit, and can't fuck with, this rap sargeant
Bluffin, talkin bout nothin, in fact
These crews be wack, so may I ask, where yo skillz at?

Chorus

[Tame One]
It's no doubt what I'm about bustin yo shit out with my lyrical
Smokin botanicals I be the man that makes the miracles
Invisible if need be, see me on TV and on CD
smokin beadies in 3-D doin graffiti
My mechanical style, interlocks rocks and shocks
cause I'm hot, X marks the spot like Sadat watch
I'm so tight with mine, nickel and dime rhymers
are smokin one quarter pushin off the corner from foul line
Prime time teams rewind and can't find mine
They all left behind because my rhymes lack guidelines
Wings get pushed back from hairlines to asscracks
So check ASCAP, on Artifacts soundtracks
So act ill, I can peel a skill like fresh bills
Crack a rapper like a Phills I smack more ass than Benny Hill
but chill a minute, I'm all up in it infinite potential
Newark, Jew Jersey resedential areas I turn to burial plots
for MC's, who don't believe what I conceive
Or leave a whole team speechless, gettin jives to Chucky Cheese
I'm like Jesus to the mic, write My Life out like Mary
I'm oh-Blige-d to J. any ghetto queen that's sanitary
Don't play me too close, you'll get roasted by the human torch
from Newark, I'm blowin up spots without tour support
I distort thoughts, with izm sticks and quarts
Laughin at rappers who come at me in soft packs like Newports
I walk that talk, get down and dirty like New York
That's why I'm still fat, beef kill that, nigga where yo skillz at?

Chorus

[El Da Sensai]
But, back to the subject at hand
Peep my battle plan and I'll be forced to chop that hand
off soft brothers yo they can't withstand
the pressure, prepare the stretcher and the Dristan
Cause in nine-six, these MC's can't miss
If you purchase this, then you see why brothers kinda pissed it's
the Mr. Flip Lipper always stayin dipped
Always talkin shit, always hittin hallways and shit

[Tame One]
I play the parks after dark and spark L's until my head bust
and then bust, plus when I get dusted you'll get messed up
Rollin with razors neighbors hate me cause I'm famous
Tame is accurate back with battle raps fat like battleships
Constantly open like a hood rat that's smokin
Got bitches in Hoboken overdosin off my potions
Wet like oceans, my notebook looks atrocious
Be dissin vocal coaches I don't let them hit my roaches
I handle my Biz like Warner
Brothers be on the corner talkin gossip, hot cause they ain't got shit
Watch this... where yo skillz at nigga?

Chorus",Where Yo Skillz At?,1997
Artifacts,"Who's this?  With the vocal pitch, I blitz
We be the top choice, moist, voice my script
Significant, different styles on instinct
Make sense, when rockin' rhymes over instruments
Known for the graf, although the crowd comes first
Activist, specialist, of the ultimate verse
All subjects correct, image is the key
If you want your peers respect show versatility
Type strange, how the whole sound is rearranged
Changed, so many players entered in the game
But not these two, we past dues, smash crews
You ask what's the task slash we bringin' the news
Dialogue, strong, not your average cabbage
Savage on the mic while other crews can't manage
Cause in these times the rhymes pay all things
Rent, bills plus your diamond pinky ring

[Chorus]
Comin from the Bricks, all mics we rip
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
With the fat penmanship for the championship
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
Fat tracks, lyrics, New Jerus click
(who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
We comin from the back with the ultimate blitz
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)

Holy Moses, I'ma come down like drug doses
With a voltage, cause I'm ready to shock whoever's closest
Bold enough to dismiss tricks, up in the mix
With my rhyme skit, bad with the ad-libs behind it
Time it, the rapper's precionist, ain't no dissin' us
It's just, another rap attack for your to discuss
It's us, fresh in the flesh, up in your session
Wildin' out like sex without protection
Right before your eyes I'ma rise up and size up
The status of the rappers while I sit in the back, smokin' my cabbage
Managin', not to get involved with the petty
We ever ready, cuttin' comp like a machete
Not the one to glorify guns, I'd rather drop it on the one
And make the funds for my late night weed runs
Dumb dums, want to do bids and start they static
They better ease back like Craftmatic

[Chorus]

Superficial rhymes on top for y'all to see
How we react on wax, DJ included exactly
Autographs in black books, dodgin' from the crooks
Recognize the stats, don't act for ill looks
But I keep a straight path like the subway stay
Underneath from deep in the depths of NJ

I be the one to get the job done, Tame One
Got funk like the Bop Gun, burnin' with the powers of a hot sun
Makin' my mark after dark like I'm a criminal
Break hard rocks to minerals like, ten star generals
Is it the way we slay the stages, that make these neighbors hate us
We fillin' up the pages with the game like Las Vegas
New Jersey native, ten minutes from the Money Makin
Stay rooted with the Buddha like Jamaicans

And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow

Stumbling all around so funny

Artrosis,"Heavenly sound swings my body gently
Between waking and sleeping I try to find peace
Strength and alleviation, necessary in the struggle,
Feed lips that are thirsty for great expectations, great words

They force to make an act of contrition
But this is only the empty gesture
Empty repentance empty words
Buried a long time ago, somewhere lost
They force to make an act of contrition
But still this is the empty gesture
Awakening - the origin of pain
I want to remain in the dreamlike state

Oysters in a trendy restaurant

With a tasty model next to me

And provide us with some proof
There's a few things that you'll have to do first
If you wanna join our troupe
You'll have to have a daily bath, that holiday in Malta
You've gotta have an ultra wide laugh
And dress like John Travolta

Arturo Coppola,"Serenade in the night 'neath a fair lady's window
Just the same serenade that I tenderly played on a night long ago
There were stars in the sky and I sang 'neath the roses
But she gave not a sign that she'd ever be mine and my love story closes
Oh! why must the south wind be bringing it?
Oh! why must my heart keep on singing it?
Serenade in the night from the past comes to haunt me

Arturo Delmoni,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Después de vivir un siglo

Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo

El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes

Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17,2005

Verse 1: Fermín IV
Si crees que se le está acabando el vuelo, no
Esto está comenzando
El danzón ya empezó a tocar (pararara) 
why no ha terminado, no
El paso del tiempo va imponiendo el respeto
why la calidad va mano a mano con la cantidad, viene 
(Viene) viene marcando la pauta why el sentimiento
Mi vida empieza desde adentro
Siempre brota lo que siento
Es verdad lo digo why me comprometo
Responsable soy why lo lamento
Pero creo que es el crecimiento
Por ahora está en el mejor momento
El amanecer siempre aparece corrigiendo al anochecer
why las cosas que se ven nacer
Hay que verlas madurar why crecer

Verse 2: Pato
Viviendo por suerte why clandestinamente
Más no estaba muerto solamente ausente
Si paré de pronto, nunca indiferente
No acabó el danzón why sigue igual que siempre
Si continúa el corazón
Ritmos unidos sobre ilusión
Noche a noche se escucha la voz
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Ruben Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Que se está bailando en cada rincón
Que está sonando en tu corazón

Verse 3: Fermín IV
Suena que suena las cartas sobre la mesa
No hay quien detenga esto nadie se mueva
Así es, todo tiene su tiempo why si estás dispuesto
A sembrar why cultivar hay que ver el fruto madurar
Hasta donde puede llegar sólo hay que desarrollar
Ampliar, solamente crear es inmenso el lugar
Espacio suficiente como para cohabitar
Escucha mi tierra hare eco
Entre las montañas se hare camino el concreto
Señales de humo que van creciendo cada día más
Tratando de comunicar
Exponiendo los adentros a la luz como van
Sin borrar nada sin tapar nada sin ocultar nada
Se presentan testimonios reales
El sentimiento no es más que puras verdades

Verse 4: Pato
Reuniendo por suerte why discretamente
Más no estaba lejos respectivamente
Si lo que se mueve proviene del vientre
No acabó el danzón why ha de seguir pa' siempre
Si se ha dado la ocasión
Ciertos sonidos de imaginación
Día a día que visita el sol
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Rubén Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Es guardar silencio de movimiento
Ayunar de color why sonido
Ser mujer viejo why niño
why dejarse llevar...

I hope that he turns out to be

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum

Arturo Sandoval,"Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things define what's within
And I have been there before, and that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby

Arturo Sandoval,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

Arturo Sandoval,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2010

For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills

A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall

Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
 
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Que lo que siembre lo cosecharé
Si doy recibiré 
Porque amar es un acto de fe
No prives al mundo de amor
Sin sol y lluvia no crece la flor
El milagro está en ti
No lo dejes morir

Un alma más y al fin marcharán ejércitos de esperanza
Unámonos y al fin se oirán los gritos de los que callan
Uno más y otro más probándonos que
Amar es un acto de fe

Te cegarás de egoísmo y así
Por las sombras irás
Y un día te olvidarás de reír
Hay tantos hombres llorando dolor
Buscando un mañana mejor
Ve y abrázalos
Y aprenderás a sentir

That no matter, come what may, love 
Would prevail
And then inside the dreams I knew
Came the question lovers fear 
Can true love fail 
I would miss the childhood wish 
And haven't I sung to you 
Of the knight in armor bright 
Faithful and true to you 

My darling, after all
I will be the one to hold you in my arms 
After all 
I will be the one to hold you 
I will be the one to hold you in my arms 
In my arms, my arms, my arms

I, I know in my heart and mind
That no matter, come what may, love will survive
See love, is the author of space and time 
And keeps the galaxies and each sparrow alive 
And the love that heals the wound 
After the war is through 
Is the knight in armor bright 
Faithful and true to you

Ya lo ves, que no hay dos sin tres
Que la vida va y viene y que no se detiene
Y, qué sé yo

Es corazón que no siente
O corazón que te miente amor
Pero, sabes que en lo más profundo de mi alma
Sigue aquel dolor por creer en ti
¿Qué fue de la ilusión y de lo bello que es vivir?
Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herido
Si hoy me dejas de nuevo el corazón partió

¿Y quién me va a entregar sus emociones?
¿Quién me va a pedir que nunca le abandone?

Is gazing up into the empty sky.

Now it's so blue
The still sea is darker than before...

No wind disturbs our coloured sail
The radio is silent, so are we
Julie's head is on her arm
Her fingers brush the surface of the sea.

Arturo Stàlteri,"Brown Eyes and I were tired 
We had walked and we had scrambled
Through the moors and through the briars 
Through the endless blue meanders 
In the blue August moon 
In the cool August moon
Over the nights and through the fires 
We went surging down the wires 
Through the towns and on the highways 

Through the storms in all their thundering
In the blue August moon 
In the cool August moon
Well we rested in a desert 
Where the bones were white as teeth, sir 
And we saw St. Elmo's Fire 
Splitting ions in the ether 
In the blue August moon

Arty McGlynn," I was born on the holy ground
A running child in fields of clover
I was living in the grandeur
Of my father's land
mmm...

By the side of the swirling sea
I spent the days of childish wonder
And the rocks I held in my young hands
I never felt them slip away

Well the sun shone bright upon the waves
And the wind blew high as I was leaving
And I sailed so far away
Looking for adventure
mmm...

But I would not stay where the city streets
proclaimed so loudly man's endeavours
Though music is a pretty thing
in fine company
And the wilderness took my breath away
I felt I had to find my way
Where no-one ever goes
mmm...

It was in the south that my new home lay
With a dark eyed boy and wild horses
With humming birds and roses there 
in old Mexico

There the winds of change they blew so far
Of liberty and revolution
And it seemed that each man heard in his breast
the drumming of a nation
mmm...

Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Arvell Shaw,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues,1996
Arvell Shaw,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,2002

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep. 

The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop, 
We'd better take another drop.",Little Brown Jug,2014

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Ay una lumbre en la ciudad esta noche. Se ve casi como accidente pero mas como mensaje. En el cielo ay un humo escribiendo tu Nombre Y abajo estoy, quemando nuestro puente. Y si tu quieres regresar, si Lo quieres intentar, vas a tener, vas a tener que nadar. Ay un estado de urgencia en las calles. Ay un clamor contra la sopresa. En la distancia hay un hombre gritando tu nombre. Y abajo estoy, quemando nuestro puente. Y si tu quieres regresar, si lo quieres intentar, vas a tener, vas a tener que nadar.

As,"I smoke myself into a haze in the afternoon
Enveloped heart, and the air is cool
Put on your dress, white Goddess
And settle in, as the weather folds
In the slow haze of the afternoon
Swaying hips, made like a gun
Blackest sails, the most beautiful, star

In the world, in the air, on my tongue
Before my eyes, beyond the stars, beneath the sun

So, take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again
So, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
Only you know

You were conceived in my heart, 
came like a dream
To save me from my mortality
Put on your dress, white Goddess
And settle in, as the weather folds
Our lives will be entwined, even when I die
You'll see me through 'til the end of time
No earthly bride, the most beautiful, star

In the world, in the air, on my tongue 
Before my eyes, beyond the stars, 
beneath the sun 

So, take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again
So, what is it worth?

And you sold me a granite kite
I was leading the dark to light

And money keeps falling out

I've got old gears and sprockets
I just can't keep turning out
So cool, she's so cool

Well, I turned into an older man
And my youth left for a distant land
And I was watching the smell turn bland
And the candy in my hand

It turned to poison and purple sand
Stick my head in the garbage can
Skin the kat, turn on the fan
Put the choice cuts in the pan

'Cause I've got holes in my pockets
And money keeps falling out
So cool, she's so cool

Save my tears for your screech and scorn
I turn the knife and punch the screw
What's a low rent slob to do

Take my heart and please don't break it,

As We Ascend,"Was it the late nights, all night, out on the road?
Was it the taste of the thrill rising up in your throat?
I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Was it the rush of the ""hush hush,"" keeping it low?
Was it the games, the chase, when you were out on your own?
I'm onto you, I'm onto you

Was it worth it in the end?
Risked it all to lose a friend
(So tell me, so tell me)
Did you find the love you need
In all the secrets that you keep?
(So tell me, so tell me)
Are you happy?

It was the late night whispers over the phone
It was the secret meets where no one would know
I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Sleep with one eye open when all eyes were closed
You destroy your kingdom while you cling to your throne
But I'm onto you, I'm onto you

Was it worth it in the end?
Risked it all to lose a friend
(So tell me, so tell me)
Did you find the love you need
In all the secrets that you keep?
(So tell me, so tell me)
Are you happy?

The wounds can heal, the tears can end
But I'll never look at you the same again
The memories in my heart may live
But for now I will choose to forgive
I know you're not past saving
But know your sins have shaped me

Was it worth it in the end?

As We Fight,"Eternal upgrading standards.
Unreachable but still we aim to become anything but ourselves.
We accept everything though it rapes.
We accept everything though it kills.
Now I search for truth in all that I got left and I'll find salvation in
Me.
This world demands perfection.
They're killing us everyday.
They're raping our mind with false hope of a happier existence.
I'll rather be imperfect of perfection.
Life is pushed aside.
Profit held so high.

As We Speak,"Girl when you hold me, how you control me
You bend and you fold me, anyway you please
It must be easy for you, the loving things that you do
But just a pastime for you, I could never be

And I never know, girl 
If I should stay or go
'Cos the games that you play 
Keep driving me away

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Kisses and caresses, are only minor tests, babe
Of love lead to stresses, between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting, isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass, girl, I'm proud to take a stand

I can't continue guessing 
Because it's only messing
With my pride and my mind 
So write down this time to time

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

I'm just a little old-fashioned
It's take more than physical attraction
My initial reaction is honey give me love
Not a facsimile of

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love (love me, love me)
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason

Asa,"Can you do this for me
Whisper a prayer
Something's happening
I’m so scared
What I waited so long for is finally here
Why does it feel so wrong
Why the tears

I always gave love
Never thought I deserve
To be the one to get love
Oh no

So I locked my heart away
Didn't need it anyway
Maybe somethings aren't meant to be
Over mountains over sea
Where i thought no man could reach
How did love find me
How did you find me

I was trying to live
Without any water
I was trying to breath
Without any air
I Was losing the fight
And now I realize
That I wasn't even alive

So I locked my heart away
Thought I didn't need it anyway
Now I know differently
Over mountains over sea
Where I thought no man could reach

My love you have found me

You found me
I'm so glad you

Tell me all your trouble
What’s on your mind Child
I’d help you if you’re worried
Share with me your secret problem
Maybe I can help you solve them

Time child is all you need 
And if you wait awhile child
You’ll find that you’d be ok
I only know of one solution
You and only you can do it

Shine your light
Don’t let nobody tell you
You can’t shine your light
Go out into the world 
and do just what you like

What’s on your mind now
See you’re not so different 
So don’t bail out
No excuses no defense
Say it like you really mean it
Every thing you say believe it

Oh yes cos after the dawn comes the light
And you know nobody can’t tell you no more
Alleluia do believes it, I can see that you can do it

Shine your light

I was talking to the weather man
About today oh oh oh
And all,all he could say
Was no one knows tomorrow

See I can read the weather child
I can say maybe the rain will fall
The sun will shine oh oh oh
But that's as far as my story goes

Cos no one knows tomorrow
Oh oh ha, no one knows tomorrow

Tell me what's the need
To go to war, all the killings
Just to settle some one else's score oh oh oh
When the victory isn't even sure

And philosophy and Plato's ideology

Or be successful if you please, yes indeed

Tomorrow is a politician's today
It's the victim of decision
And the future of our children

Will I be in heavenly places?

Fazer uma auê
Quando a banda tocar

Venha cair na folia
De noite ou de dia
Que o som vai rolar

Sacode a poeira
Segura a loira na dança
Eu vou atras do trio
Essa zoeira nao me cansa

E quem quiser 
Que se balance

Agora vai ser pra valer
Quero ver voce
Botar pra quebrar

Caia nessa folia
Que o som vai rolar

Asa Harris,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1999
Asa Harris,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1999
Asa Harris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999
Asaf Avidan,"My life is like a wound
I scratch so I can bleed
Regurgitate my words
I write so I can feed
And death grows like a tree
That's planted in my chest
Its roots are at my feet
I walk so it won't rest

Oh, baby I am lost
I said oh, baby I am lost

I try to push the colours
Through a prism back to white
To sync our different pulses
Into a blinding light
And if love is not the key
If love is not a key
I hope that I can find
A place where it could be

I know that in your heart
There is an answer to a question
Which I'm not as yet aware that I have asked
And if that tree had not drunk my tears
I would have bled and cried for all the years
That I alone have let them pass

And oh, baby I am yours
I said oh, baby I am yours
And oh, baby I am yours
I said oh, baby I am yours",Different Pulses,2012
Asaf Avidan,"Long are the days when you're turning away
From the reasons you strung
Long is the way, when you're aching to say
But your teeth bite your tongue

Loud is the wind in your ears as you spin
As you look for the sun
Loud are the skies as you thunder your cries
When your prayers are sung

Hard is the floor as the waves pound the shore
Of your wounds
Roll up your sleeve it's hard to believe
But it's you

Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it you got to believe it

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind

Slow is the night when you reach for the light
But the dark lingers on
Slow is the bite of the words that you write
When it’s finally dawn

How can you swim when the waters are streaming in you?
Roll up your sleeve now love it or leave it it's you

Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it you got to believe it

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time

My strength within

It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender
Just give me a little more time
To open my mind
It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender
Surrender to you

Fears, I leave them far behind
To resist you, I don't know how
Love, sometimes can be unkind
Should I lay my heart on the line now

And when temptation comes along
I can't hide it, I can't fight it
Feelings inside are getting strong
Cannot deny it, you've got it

It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender
Just give me a little more time
To open my mind
It's only a matter of time
And I will surrender

To make my own destiny
To make my mark in history

And the ones who saved our lives
Are well worth dying for

Going down a one train line 
Living on dreams half the time
Going west

I gotta pick up speed 
Just to get what I need 
The end of the line guaranteed 
Your love is my rest.

The coal catches fire and I'm down the wire in a flash 
That big old smoksack is belching out black smoke and ash 
So sad to think of 
Hurting the one you love 
But surely that's what leaving does 
You'd know best.

I gotta pick up speed 
Just to get what I need 
The end of the line guaranteed 
Your love is my rest.

I stand in the land of Custer's last stand and I grin 
So this is where old yellow-hair's ghost-dance begins 
I got the blood on my hands 
Can't even live where I stand

Cursed or blessed

Entdeckte ich in jungen Jahren meine Begabung
Sammelte reichlich Erfahrung suchte geistige Nahrung
Wusste irgendwann klappt es niemals Zeitpunkt und Datum

Nennt mich Oscargewinner Rockstar für immer
Hock' da im Zimmer vor 'nem Bildschirm der flimmert
Mach' Beats schreib' Zeilen paff' Weed bleib' high

Sah viele kommen sah noch mehr gehen
Viele verirrten sich auf der Suche nach noch mehr Fame
Überzogen ihre 15 Minuten
Setzen hohe Ziele aber nahmen den günstigsten Flug hin
Auf diesem Weg helfen keine Wünschelruten
Und wenn man nicht voran kommt dann nützt kein Hupen
Jeder will ein Stück vom Kuchen jeder will Rapstar sein
Keiner will dafür früh aufstehen wie der Bäcker nein
Ich rapp solang es noch ne Deadline gibt
Und'n Publikum was sich meine Tracks reinzieht
Bis man auf den kleinen Monitoren 'ne Flatline sieht
Ab jetzt schreib' ich jedes Lied als wär's das letzte Lied

Will die Welt erobern niemand stellt sich in den Weg
Und auch wenn alle nur den Spinner sehen
Mit 25 auf dem Gipfel dacht' ich es war keine große Sache
Und trug den Kopf hoch denk' jede Chance am Schopf zu packen
Mit 30 lern' ich Zweifeln war alles bloß ne Masche
Lügt mir doch weiter in die Hosentasche

Ich werde hier nur noch den einen Satz vorlesen
den Sie durch ihren Wortentzug verhindert haben.

Evolution vom Neandertaler
Zum Homosapiens weiter zum Digitaler
Cyberage, Trittbrettfahrer, Roboter, Wireless Junkies
Ferngesteuert mit 32-Bit Munchies
Tatada, Social Media Mafia, Flatrate, Update, Webpage, Massaker
Vor den Augen helle Screens, Knöpfe in den Ohren
Blick nach unten, über unsere Köpfe fliegen Drohnen
Wann soll der Wahnsinn enden
Arme Menschen sitzen auf Datenbänken statt Gartenbänken
Spielen dabei Kilohertz Raten jenen in Funkwellen baden
Die Welt wird zusammengehalten von Glasfaserkabeln
Schmeiß den Router an, willkommen in der Zukunft man
Da wo es nix gibt was man nicht googeln kann
Der Mensch muss kämpfen solang er noch bluten kann
Gegen die Maschine im Minutentakt, wutenbrannt

Das habt ihr gut erkannt

Yeah, das ist Mensch gegen Maschine
Das ist Blut gegen Öl, Programmierung gegen Triebe
DNA gegen Chipsatz und Platine
Stahl gegen Knochen, Freiheit oder schwedische Gardine
Ich marschiere, habe Angst doch ich kämpf
Und ich renn ganz egal ob ich verliere
Rücken an der Wand, hab' keine Alternative
Gott ruft der Mob und verhalten sich wie Tiere
Dieser Kampf lohnt immer
Der Feind ist im TV, in meinem Wohnzimmer
Todbringer, so war das schon immer
Im Mondschimmer kommt aus Fleisch und Blut, Godzilla
Minus im Depot, ah
Offline so wie Kino.to, ah
Nicht jeder kann ein Maximus sein
Daumen runter, Augen hoch, trau' nicht mal Optimus Prime

(Wah) nimm' sie hoch
(Wah) alle hoch
(Wah) fühlt ihr das?
(Wah) spürt ihr das?
Schreit ma' und seit ma' so laut ihr könnt
Lasst das Thermometer steigen bis das Haus hier brennt
Und wenn wir da sind überkommt euch alle dieser Wahnsinn
Leute haben begriffen, dass wir zwei am Start sind
Schreit ma' und seit ma' so laut ihr könnt

„Hamburg City, was für ein Abend
Was für ein Line Up
Hip Hops finest
Noch einmal, Samy Deluxe“

Scheiß auf Sprechgesang, dies ist Rapshit, Mann
Hört euch die Beats, die Flows, die Texte an
Wir haben noch mehr für euch als Rap auf Deutsch
ASD die Partei, komm und setz dein Kreuz
Wär mein Scheiß kompliziert, versnobbt, ein bisschen tanzbar
? mein erster schwarzer Bundeskanzler
Rede euch gut zu, sag, dass ich euch gut tu'
Zieh euch in den Bann, denn ich hab' etwas von Voodoo
Ich sag uuh wir rebellieren gegen die System
Indem wir Spliffs drehen und uns zurücklehnen
Ihr wollt Afrob und Samy Deluxe sehen?
Zu den Gigs gehen und die Tonträger mitnehmen?
Ja, das ist was ihr wollt
All' uns're Leute hier
Nord (Nord) Süd (Süd) Ost (Ost) West (West)
Macht, macht, macht, ma' Lärm jetzt

Wah! Nimmt sie hoch, alle hoch
Fühlt ihr das, spürt ihr das?
Schreit ma' und seit ma' so laut wie ihr könnt
Lasst das Thermometer steigen bis das Haus hier brennt
Und wenn wir da sind überkommt euch alle dieser Wahnsinn
Leute haben begriffen,
Sag, schreit ma' und seit ma' so laut ihr könnt
Yeah, komm

Ich will ich hören sagen
Wah! Wah! Wah!
Was? Was? Was? Was? Was?
Und wenn wir da sind überkommt euch alle dieser Wahnsinn
Leute haben begriffen, dass wir zwei am Start sind
Schreit ma' und seit ma' so laut ihr könnt
