Henry Allen & His Orchestra,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1996
Henry Allen & His Orchestra,"Dear old Southland I hear you calling me.
And I long how I long to roam 
back to my old Kentucky home.
Dear old Southland for you my heart is yearning
And I long just to see once more",Dear Old Southland,1997
Henry Allen & His Orchestra,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore",Don't Get Around Much Anymore,2003
Henry Allen & His Orchestra,"I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
I've got a song that I sing

I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go

I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
 
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go

Man this is the life 
And now I'm so in love!",I've Got the World on a String,2003
Henry Bergstrom,"Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I...
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears

I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I...
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart",Never Tear Us Apart,2006
Henry Binns,"I lie awake
I've gone to ground
I'm watching porn
In my hotel dressing gown
Now I dream of you
But I still believe
There's only enough for one in this lonely hotel suite

The journey's long
And it feels so bad
I'm thinking back to the last day we had
Old moon fades into the new
Soon I know I'll be back with you
I'm nearly with you
I'm nearly with you

When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
And when I'm down you breathe life over me
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny

On a clear day
I'll fly home to you
I'm bending time getting back to you
Old moon fades into the new
Soon I know I'll be back with you
I'm nearly with you

When I'm weak I draw strength from you
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood

Henry Binns,"Fancy a big house
Some kids and a horse
I can not quite, but nearly
Guarantee, a divorce
I think that I love you
I think that I do
So go on mister, make Miss me Mrs you.

I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
I only make jokes to distract myself
From the truth, from the truth.

Fancy a fast car
A bag full of loot
I can nearly guarantee
You'll end up with the boot

I love you, I love you, I love you , I do

Thinking back to God knows where
Always back to where he's been
I have seen I have seen

Time goes so slow
Days come and go
But I know, yes I know

New born son
Life has won
Take this turn then he'll run
Run away from all that's been
I have done, I have seen

Time goes so slow
Days come and go
But I know, yes I know",I Have Seen,2001

Henry Binns,"It's an easy ride to roam 
You'll never walk alone

Another race is won

Henry Bogdan,"I could settle down
And be doin' just fine
Till I hear that old freight
Comin' down the line
Then I hurry straight
Home and pack and if I didn't go
I'd be 'bout lose my stack
I love you, baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I got to see
Sometimes it's hard, but you gotta understand
When the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Let me travel this land
From the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life I believe
He meant for me
And when I'm gone, and at my grave you stand
Just say God's called home your ramblin' man",Ramblin' Man,2000

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting

As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2005
Henry Burr,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day

Henry Burr,"Is the struggle and strife we find in this life
Really worth while, after all
I've been wishing today I could just run away
Out where the west winds call

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

Is the future to hold just struggles for gold
While the real world waits outside
Away out on the breast of the wonderful west
Across the great divide

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by",Let the Rest of the World Go By,2002

I love you, don't let us part
I love you, I always knew it would be you
Since I heard your lilting laughter

Your glances make my heart say ""How's chances?""
Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

What if I find that I'm caught in a storm?
I don't care my baby's there
And baby's bound to keep me warm

We're sticking together and ain't we got fun
So much together you'd count us as one
Tell old man worry to go climb a tree
'Cause I'm with my baby, I've got my baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
A dream of a duo now don't you agree
Why keep it mum when there's nothing to hide?
And what I feel I must reveal
It's more that I can keep inside

And I can assure you it won't go away
Let me assure you it grows every day
I was a one once but now I'm a we
'Cause I got my baby, dear little baby
Look at my baby and me

Look at my baby, my baby and me
Facing the world optimistically
Nothing can stop us so nobody try
'Cause baby's rough and full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I

Get out of our way, folks and give us some room
Watch how we bubble and blossom and bloom
Life was a prison but we got the key
Me and my baby, me and my baby
Dear little baby, cute little baby
Look at my baby and me

",Me and My Baby,1998
Henry Goodman,"If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him

If someone in the movie show
Yelled, ""Fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg""
You'd notice him

And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then
Unless, of course, that person it should be
Invisible, inconsequential me

Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya, Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man for seven years
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human being next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who

Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there

I hope, I haven't taken too much of your time

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

Henry Hall & BBC Dance Orchestra,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1995
Henry Hall & BBC Dance Orchestra,"Underneath the arches,
We dream our dreams away,
Underneath the arches,
On cobblestones we lay.
Back to back we're sleeping,
Tired out and Worn,
Happy when the daylight comes creeping,
Heralding the dawn.

Sleeping when it's raining,
And sleeping when it's fine,
Trains rattling by above.
Pavement is my pillow,
No matter where I roam,
Underneath the arches,
We dream our dreams of home.

Henry Hayes,"In questo girotondo d'anime
Chi si volta è perso e resta qua
Io so per certo amico
Mi son voltato anch'io

E per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché
In questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto
Per scrollarsi via di dosso

Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa
E allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio a senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Io mi prenderò il mio posto
E tu seduta lì al mio fianco
Mi dirai destinazione paradiso

Henry James,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

Oh please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all

All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1993

It's been a long, long time

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

Very sleek in physique, stood about six feet 
Dispute was jet black I had to step back 
His dimeanor wasn't pure, I knew this for sure 
He had a diseased look that the world couldn't cure 
I'm forzen, the fear returned to my body 
Heart pumpin so fast, I thought I was goin into cardiac arrest 
I wake up in a cold sweat, wifey sleepin on my left sound asleep 
I peep around the room then I make a sudden jest 
A feather from a black crow was beside my pillow 
Was it a sign from God to repute for the things that I did in my lifetime 
Now my soul's on the line 
I'm puzzled, spark up a Newport 
Then I take a fall in hell it's the cancer 
Then I try and find an answer

Pull up the blinds there sits the crow

Open my eyes up, I'm layin on the dark street 
Leaves blowin in the breezes, Jesus 
I on the street like a nightmare 
I take flight, a bird through the air 
While I'm wingin it I see all sorts of chaos

So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean

Henry Mancini,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings

But most of them rise away to the skies of blue

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.

But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.

Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,1964
Henry Mancini,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1964

Angels composed it for us to dance to.

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

And Cuban rum
And towels from

The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth.

We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own,

You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
Ben most people would turn you away;
I don't listen to a word they say.

Henry Mancini,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1976

Henry Mancini,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind,1984

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard

You made life worth the price we all pay
When the whole world goes wrong

Did you know that I've won come what may?

I am part of your song
And you knew it all along
You gave me music on the way

With your song in my heart
I'd laugh about the starts and starts
And all that I have lost along the way

What you knew is all along
You gave me music on my way

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?

Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song

And for moments gives them life

That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

Henry Mancini & His Orchestra & Chorus,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

We have to learn to live with the good and bad
Together we were happy, apart we're sad
This loneliness is driving me mad

Henry Rene's Orchestra,"There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a 
Lecture on horses and chickens and eggs,
And told her that she has such beautiful
Manners that suited a girl of her charms,
A girl that he'd like for to take in his
Washing and ironing, and then if she did,
They could get married and raise lots of

Sweet violets, sweeter than the roses,
Covered all over from head to toe,
Covered all over with sweet violets.

The girl told the farmer that he'd better stop, 
And she told her father and called a 
Taxi which got there before very long,
For someone was doing his little girl
Right for a change, and so here's what he said:
""If you marry her, son, you're better off
Single 'cause it's always been my belief,
Marriage can bring a man nothing but

[Chorus]

The farmer decided he'd wed anyway,
And started in planning for his wedding
Suit which he'd purchased for only one buck,
But then he found out he was just out of
Money and so he got left in the lurch,
Standing and waiting in front of the
End of this story, which just goes to show,
All a girl wants from a man is his

I am the product of your restraint
I watched the years pass by me
Never once did I complain

Never once did I say no
Now I watch myself explode
My body is scarred by age
Now you get to taste my rage

From the wreckage of humiliation
I got my self respect
I pulled myself together

Henry Rollins,"When no one will listen and time won't wait
When you see yourself and see the one that you hate
When the night lasts forever and time stands still
When you see yourself and want to kill
When the world doesn't fit the head on your shoulders
When you punch the walls and feel the world's fist
The big ideas you have leave you feeling so small
I can see it in your eyes you can't deal with it all

What do you do when you want to get over
What do you do when you want to get through
What do you do when you just can't take it
What do you do when you just can't fake it anymore

Feel the pressure
Feel it squeeze
The eyes in your head
The heart in your chest
Where's the answer
Where's the release
What do you do

When the lies that they told and the price that you paid
Force you to see the mistake that you made
When they shake your hand and stab your back
When frustration paints your four walls black
When they pick you up and let you fall
When you find their something is nothing at all
When ends miss ends and the endlessness sends you
Down to the bottom of the drain in pain
When you're pushed to the edge and can't maintain",What Do You Do,1992
Henry Rollins,"I know you
You are too short
You had bad skin
You couldn't talk to them very well
Words didn't seem to work
They lied when they came out of your mouth
You tried so hard to understand them
You wanted to be part of what was happening
You saw them having fun
And it seemed like such a mystery
Almost magic
Made you think there was something wrong with you
You'd look in the mirror trying to find it
You thought you were ugly
And everyone was looking at you
So you learned to be invisible
To look down
To avoid conversation
The hours, days, weekends
Ah the weekend nights alone
Where were you?
In the basement?
In the attic?
In your room?
Working some job?
Just to have something to do?
Just to have a place to put yourself?
Just to have a way to get away from them
A chance to get away from the ones who made you feel so strange and
Ill-at-ease inside yourself
Did you ever get invited to one of their parties?
You sat and wondered if you would go or not
For hours you imagined the scenarios that might transpire
They would laugh at you
If you'd know what to do
If you would had the right things on
If they' d notice you came from a different planet
Did you get all brave in your thoughts?
Like you were going to go in there and deal with it
And have a great time
Did you think that you might be the life of the party?
That all these people were going to talk to you
To find out that you were wrong
That you had a lot of friends and you weren't so strange after all
Did you end up going?
Did they mess with you?
Did they single you out?
Did you find out you were invited because they thought you were so weird

Yeah, I think I know you
You spent alot of time full of hate
A hate as pure as sunshine
A hate that saw for miles
A hate that kept you up at night
A hate that filled your every waking moment
A hate that carried you for a long time

Yes, I think I know you
You couldn't figure out what they saw in the way they lived
Home was not home
Your room was home
A corner was home
The place they weren't
That was home

I know you
You're sensitive and you hide cuz you fear getting stepped on one more time
It seems that when you show a part of yourself 
That is the least bit vulnerable someone takes advantage of you
One of them steps on you
They mistake kindness for weakness
But you know the difference
You've been the brunt of their weakness for years
And strength is something you know a bit about
Because you had to be strong to keep yourself alive

You know yourself very well you now
And you don't trust people
You know them too well

You try to find that special person
Someone you can be with
Someone you can touch
Someone you can talk to
Someone you wont feel so strange around
And you found that they don't really exist
You feel closer to people on movie screens

Yeah, I think I know you
You spend a lot of time day dreaming
And people have made comment to that affect
Telling you that your self involved and self centered
But they don't know do they?
About the long night shifts alone
About the years of keeping yourself company
All the nights you wrapped your arms around yourself so you could imagine someone holding you
The hours of indecision, self doubt,
The intense depression
The blinding hate the rage that made you stagger
The devastation of rejection

Well, maybe they do know
But if they do they sure do a good job of hiding it
It astounds you how they can be so smooth
How they seem to pass through life
As if life itself was some divine gift
And it infuriates you to watch yourself 
With your apparent skill in finding every way possible to screw it up
For you life is a long trip
Terrifying and wonderful
Birds sing to you at night
The rain and the sun
The changing seasons are true friends
Solitude is a hard won allie
Faithful and patient

Yeah I think I know you",I Know You,1993

So you stagger back home and wait for nothing
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back onto the streets
And now you're desperate and in need of human contact
And then you meet me and yur whole world changes

I'll come to you like an affliction then I'll leave you like an addiction
You'll never forget me... wou wanna know why? 

I don't know why I feel the need to lie and cause you so much pain

Turned around
Made to see

Color bends

Ripped away
Burned away

In the black and white
Black and white
Can't hide bright light
Shining through the darkest night


In the black and white

new eyes
Hate lies
Sun blind
Everything to see
Sun light
Blind light
Burned hollow
Burned clean
Everything to see
Find light
In dark
Blind eyes see
All the colors lie
I'm an only man

The lies hurt my mind so I think you understand
Color driven madness was all I used to see
Lving in the black and white
Breathing in the black and white
Being what there is to be
Seeing what there is to see
Is the only thing left for me

Hablar de ternura y pasíon 
Auqnue en el momento esa no es mi intención 
Hay sábanas blancas, aroma y merlot 
Sensual movimiento al compás del reloj 
Tan solo el deseo de no pensar en mañana 
Solo en mi cama

And so am I
The workday passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm getting paid by the hour and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd love to call him something, but I think I'll just call it a day

It's five o'clock somewhere

Well this lunchbreak is gonna take all afternoon
And half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone is for me you can tell 'em I just sailed away

So I wrote this job description

I sleep eighty miles an hour
To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
Dreamin' 'bout my little girls
The easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
Then we shut her down in another town
Shower up and do just what we came to do
Sing for the people
Count the money and the miles back home to you

Well each night I take the stage
With a six-piece band and a guitar in my hand
Singin' songs about my life
All the good times and the bad

Then we say goodbye and we load it up
And head somewhere I've already been
Then I lay down in that double bed alone
And I thank the lord again

Takin' that new job in Tennessee
I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost, it's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

You said time was all you really needed
So I walked away and let you have your space
Leaving didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face

And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance, I'd lie again

Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.

Easy prey, child's play.
I knew this girl was no one night stand;
Felt just like putty in her hands.

This is the girl, she's the one.

And melt your cold, cold heart

Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didn't do

And melt your cold, cold heart

Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart

And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Henson Cargill,"When the morning sun streaks across my room
Lord I'm wakened up from another dream of you
And I'm on the road once again it seems
That all I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know I love you yes I love you oh how I love you

I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That this dollar sign whould be keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh how I love you

And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this world had not yet crossed our minds
For the answer could be found in children's nursery rhymes
And I'd come running back to youand I'd come running back to you

No you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
That this traveling life is the only one I know
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you

Henson Cargill,"Ridin' on the City of New Orleans Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors twenty-four sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train rolls out of Kankakee

Rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names switchyards full of old black men
Of graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you

Said don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Playin' card games with an old man on the club car
Many a point no one's keepin' score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels a rumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America how are you...

Well it's night time on the City of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home I'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea

And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearin' railroad blues

Good night America how are you...",City of New Orleans,1974
Henson Cargill,"Sometimes too much fuel can smother up the fire
And sometimes too much love can strangle that desire
I held her too tight till the feeling was gone
Oh I wish I'd known enough about love to leave love enough alone

Sometimes a single tear can speak a thousand lies
And sometimes it's hard to tell the foolish from the wise
Someone who could be so right could also be so wrong
Oh I wish I'd known enough about love to leave love enough alone

When you cast too bigger shadow love can grow enough to show
It's a pity I didn't know enough to know
But it always seems to happen when a brier meets a rose
Oh I wish I'd known enough about love to leave love enough alone
But it always seems to happen...",I Wish I'd Known Enough About Love,1974
Henson Cargill,"She would meet me in the morning on my way down to the river
Waitin' patient by the Chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees
And I'd paid her no attention as she tagged along beside me
Trying hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid

Even after we grew older we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the seasons she was changing to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man
And she often lay beside me in the coolness of the evening
Till the morning sun was shining on my bed
And at times when she was sleeping I would smile when I'd remember
How they used to call us Jody and the kid

Now the world's a little older and the years have changed the river
'Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sunday I go walking down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl that follows me
And it makes the old folks smile to see her tag along beside me
Doing little things the way her mama did
But it gets a little lonesome when I hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid",Jody and the Kid,1974
Henson Cargill,"I know it seems you've finally won her over
That you've taken her from these two arms of mine
But a taste of your love only makes her thirsty
And she still comes to me to pour the wine

She still comes to me when she gets lonely
When another's love has stopped she turns to mine
And though she may come to you to set the table
She still comes to me to pour the wine

I'm not surprised to see her clutch at your love
For she's been known to stray from time to time
But when she's had her fill of milk and honey

She still comes to me to pour the wine
She still comes to me...
She still comes to me to pour the wine",She Still Comes to Me (To Pour the Wine),1974

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times

Hepburn,"There was a time when 
I would go walking backwards
Round the world if you said you're mine
And I'd run blindfold down the
Kings Road Monday morning
If you'd just for once arrive on time
But you turned into another liar
And you came on like a new Messiah
So before you say what you desire
I'm telling you nowÅ 

I Quit! I Quit! 
'cause loving you's a job I don't need
Ain't gonna go to work no more
I Quit! I Quit!

Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work

I got my hands dirty whole you rolled cigarettes
With one eye on the time
I tried my hardest, I've been conscientious
But I'm taking back that heart of mine
You can't roll me round your tongue no more baby
It's time to clear up your emotional debris
And if I'm falling overboard, please don't save me
'cause I'm telling you nowÅ 

I Quit! I Quit!

It's too late to say you're sorry
You're just like every other lover
A shot rings out and you go running for cover
And I'm so sorry that I can't be your mother
And I'm telling you nowÅ

To depend on someone else to do those things that you won't do

You'll always find a way to solve them.
I will always be there for you,
I will be by your side.

The question was of happiness and the answer is you

You and I walking hand in hand
Count our problems small like those grains of sand
And as we watch the water steal our trouble from the land
It seems not long ago .. my worries touched the sky
They were piled so high, thought I would not make it through
But the question was of happiness and the answer is you

You and I on that black sand shore
Watch the clouds roll by and the seagulls soar

Her Space Holiday,"I'm losing my mind in a record amount of time
Is it all in my head?
These ghosts in the hall ways, and mirrors, and under my bed

In each town I find there's always a graveyard near by
I'm taking here home
That girl from Glasgow whose father just left her alone

And I was moved inside that crooked room
I reached out my hand and shyly asked her to dance
She cried as we swayed and in my head that song continues to play
The saddest melody that just won't go away

And in my mind she's fully real
A little voice that helps me feel
And if they thought I was crazy then
Wait until they meet my friend ",Lydia [Panóptica Remix],2005
Her Space Holiday,"When I think about the world and how big it can seem I know I can get through it all with my best friend right next to me we started out as little kids and watched each other grow and anywhere I went with you I felt like I was home we won't worry about our future or fret about our past we'll enjoy our time together knowing that this quietness will last

When I think about my family and how much they've endured I want to wrap them in my arms and keep them safe and warm but they would never know this because I'm so far removed fixated on my bloodline I adopted my excuse it wasn't on the radio or on some TV show I used it for survival I'm learning how to slowly let it go

When I think about my enemies and all the time we waste suiting up in armor for the battle that we waged I want to pull my t shirt off and wave it in their face and yell out I surrender I no longer have the strength so let's rip up all the score cards and call the game a tie we'll both become the winners and walk away with a little peace of mind

When I think about my history a collection of events filled with important characters who mostly came and went regret is like a bill unpaid it controls your every move if you throw it into the violent see it will always come right back to you the past presents the future take your hands from your eyes so you can wave to all the people as you roll through what's left of your life

Her V Disc Boys,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1995

Just for a tender while I kissed a smile upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered, 'manana'
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered, 'manana'
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white, by the candlelight, she knelt to pray
