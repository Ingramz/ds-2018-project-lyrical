Joseph Chedid,"Je ne rêve plus ne rêve pas se vide en moi j'ai perdu quelque chose
Je n'entend plus je n'entend pas cette petite voix qui me disait
""On aura tout le temps""
Mes instant d'oubli mes espérances mes belle folie sont t elle à quelqu'un d'autre?
Et dans la nuit sous leur silence je m'évanouis et je me dit
""On aura tout le temps""

Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'il se perdent?
Où vont les vœux est ce qu'ils reviennent?
Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'ils se perdent?
Où vont les vœux se qu'ils deviennent ce qu'il deviennent?

Est ce qu'il se rappelle de nos sourires de nos querelles et de toute ses choses
Faite qu'il revienne me tende la main
Et qu'il m’entraîne en me chuchotant ""on aura tout le temps""

Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'il se perdent?
Où vont les vœux est ce qu'ils reviennent?
Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'ils se perdent?
où vont les vœux ce qu'ils deviennent ce qu'il deviennent?

Ce qu'il deviennent
Je ne rêve plus ne rêve pas se vide en moi j'ai perdu quelque chose
Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'ils se perdent?
Où vont les vœux est ce qu'ils reviennent?
Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'ils se perdent?
Où vont les vœux se qu'ils deviennent ce qu'ils deviennent?
Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'ils se perdent?
Où vont les vœux est ce qu'ils reviennent?
Où s'en vont les souvenirs lorsqu'ils se perdent?
Où vont les vœux se qu'ils deviennent?",Ce Qu'ils Deviennent,2015
Joseph Chedid,"Mon corps est froid, mon cœur a peur 
Si loin déjà, des jolies heures 
Mon ami, le plus grand, s'en va
Il s'enfuit, comme le vent dehors 

J'entends se briser mon cœur de pierre
Dans la voie lactée ,un autre amour se perd
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison
Tout près de moi chante la chanson

Tu est parti , tu es partout 
Même la nuit me donne des coups 
Sous les larmes, mon sourire, se voit 

Et la femme de cire, s'évade

J'entends se briser mon cœur de pierre 
Dans la voie lactée ,un autre amour se perd
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison
Tout près de moi, chante la chanson 

Si froid déjà, des jolies heures
Et je pense à toi, j'en perds la raison 
Tout près de moi, chante la chanson 

Chante la chanson
Et je pense à toi",Coeur de Pierre,2015
Joseph Chedid,"J’suis comme une bulle de savon
Un petit point sans horizon
Un ticket d’aller sans retour
Pour dire bonjour
J’suis comme un funambule
Qu’aurait avalé une pendule
Un cœur de plus
Qui fait boum boum
Parmi la foule

Je ne suis qu’un maillon de la chaîne
Aspirateur d’oxygène
Jaloux des années lumière
Une poussière

Danseur mondain
De tango argentin
Toute cette gomina

Ces tralalas
Ça sert à quoi?

Derrière l’azur
Derrière le temps
Y’a quelque chose d’inquiétant
Quelque chose qui a tout son temps
Et qui attend

Qui attend qu’le bonheur se fane
Comme une fleur sous cellophane
Qui attend que tombent les larmes
Que voguent les âmes

Alors danse, danseur mondain
Ce tango argentin
Même si toute cette gomina
Ces tralalas
Ça sert à rien",Danseur Mondain,2015
Joseph Chedid,"Emprisonnée dans tes cellules
Ta vie se réduit à tes premiers pas
Livré à moi-même
Je profite de ce silence
Histoire de lire
Te relire

Descendre en soi
De l’or dans les doigts
Je lis sur tes lèvres
Le temps qui passe
Et tout qui s’efface
Autour de toi

Délivre, délivre, délivre-moi

En sursis
Toute seule
La ville

Même si dans tes yeux
Je décèle…
Je sais qu’un jour

Tes armées de mots
Désarment mon âme
Ta plume, un couteau
Malgré le temps qui passe
Et tout qui s’efface
Raconte-moi

Délivre, délivre-moi

Les mots me manquent
Pour te dire
Le soleil se couche
Soudain, j’aperçois

Délivre, délivre, délivre-moi",Délivre,2015
Joseph Chedid,"Tout est sale, sale, sale
Dans ton journal
Tellement sale
Ça t'laisse des traces sur les doigts

Tout est moche, moche, moche
Mais tu t'en laves les mains
Et tu les mets dans tes poches
Ça vient d'si loin, loin, loin

Toutes ces images qu'on t'envoie
Toute cette misère par satellite
Ça va mal, mal, mal
Mais tu t'en fiches pas mal

Toi, toi, toi tu penses qu'à toi
Je, je, je tu sais dire que ça
T'es qu'un egomane
Un ego egomane
Ego, ego, ego egomane

Sœur Thérésa-sa-sa connais pas
Calcutta, Calcutta ou c'est ça?
Tu fais des saunas, des régimes
Pour rentrer dans ton blue-jean

Pendant que là-bas, bas, bas
Ça fait boum
Bazookas mitraillettes
Et balles doum, doum

Tu dis tous des fanatiques des maniaques
Oh, quelle époque
La politique c'est vraiment pas mon truc

Toi, toi, toi tu penses qu'à toi
Je, je, je tu sais dire que ça
T'es qu'un egomane
Un ego egomane
Ego, ego, ego egomane

Ego, egomane, ego, egomane
Ego, egomane, ego, egomane
Ego, egomane

Please, please, please pourquoi tu m'vises?
Tu veux vraiment que j'culpabilise
Que j'fasse une crise, crise, crise
Et que j'termine en analyse en analyse

Je suis comme tout le monde
Un ego, egomane, ego, ego, ego, egomane
Moi, moi, moi, moi, moi
Je, je, je, j'suis comme tout le monde

Un egomane
Un ego egomane

Joseph Chedid,"Autour de toi il y a l'infini. 
Chanter pour se sentir libre 

Vue de l'intérieur ça peut faire peur... 

Puisqu'il y a autour de toi
ce qu'il y a autour de moi
pourquoi ne vois-tu pas? 

Ce qu'il y a autour de toi 
ce qu'il y a autour de moi
 
Danser le jour au rythme des tambours 
Sentir son âme aimer l'étranger 

Vue de l''intérieur ça peut faire peur...

Joseph Chedid,"J'veux être belle mais j'y arrive pas
Dans ma tête, c'est pas la joie
C'est la fête dehors, on danse
On s'embrasse, et moi je pense

Je les vois, les jolies filles
Dans les rues elles me titillent,
L'air des marches douces et fragiles
M'insupporte, ça m'rend hostile

Je suis moi, rien que moi J'ai dans ma ligne de mire
Celle que je ne suis pas
Je suis moi, rien que moi

En soirée, les belles plantes
Se déhanchent, flamboyantes
En paillettes et en oeillades
C'est un fait, ça m'rend malade

Moi, jalouse? Pas du tout
Bon, d'accord, allez j'avoue
J'voudrais bien, rien qu'une fois
Qu'on m'regarde un peu comme ça

Un beau jour, mon heure viendra
A mon tour, la candeur et l'éclat

Je suis moi, rien que moi J'ai dans ma ligne de mire
Celle que je ne suis pas
Je suis moi, rien que moi

J'ai du charme, c'est c'qu'on me dit
C'est un drame, j'veux être jolie
J'ai brisé tous mes miroirs
Si belle, si bien dans le noir

Celle que je ne suis pas

Joseph Chedid,"Quand je te revois Mama Sam 
Je retrouve les vraies valeurs 
Un si grand cœur une si belle âme 
Qui ne se soucie jamais de l'heure 

Quand je pense qu'elle était comme moi 
Issue de ce pays glacial 
Maintenant qu'elle vit au Kenya 
C'est l'africaine occidentale 

Non je ne connais pas l'Afrique 
Aigrie est ma couleur de peau 
La vie est une machine à  fric 
Où les affreux non pas d'afro 

Tous ces jeunes américanisés

Génération très, très marquée 
Mama Sam est consternée 

À cette époque ou faire l'amour 
Est un danger pour l'humanité 

Il est honteux d'afficher ""Nike"" 
Sur nos vêtements dégénérés 

Non je ne connais pas l'Afrique 
Aigrie est ma couleur de peau 
La vie est une machine à  fric 
Où les affreux non pas d'afro 

Mama Sam cette fois c'est décidé 
M'éloigner de Paname me f'rais le plus grand bien 
Et si ça s'trouve je n'reviendrai jamais 
Je s'rais le plus blanc-bec de tous les africains

Joseph Chedid,"Pourquoi toutes ces caresses inégales

Joseph Chedid,"J'aimerais dessiner 
peindre 
jouer la comédie 
être un grand musicien 
avoir plein de projets 
et me réinventer 
toucher les gens, 
ne jamais perdre mes racines 
trouver ou m'affirmer.
 
Lire, écrire, savoir aimer, écouter, entendre, expliquer, 
connaître l'anglais et même l'espagnol, 
pourquoi pas d'autres langues. 
Etre impartial, être courageux, téméraire, travailleur, audacieux, 
respectueux, sensible, ouvert, juste être un artiste. 

La liste est longue, longue, longue 
La liste est longue, longue, longue 

Mieux connaître ma langue et son histoire 
ouvrir mes écoutilles 
chanter comme un oiseau 
voyager à tous les niveaux 
plaire, déplaire, 
goûter ou même apprendre l'art du silence 
être et surtout évoluer, travailler mon sens du rythme 
Innover échanger rencontrer, 
c'est sûr apprendre la nature, 
les animaux 
ne plus avoir peur des chiens 
m'intéresser et ne pas dénigrer 
la liste est longue oui très longue et elle ne s'arrêtera jamais. 

La liste est longue, longue, longue 
La liste est longue, longue, longue",Ode aux Envies,2015

Joseph Chedid,"Dans le sang 
Il y a un œdème qui me gène 
J'écris amer 
Pour me faire taire 
Pour me faire terre 

De toi à moi, 
Je ne sais pas aimer 
Sans pleurs tordu de peur, 
Se fânent les heures
 
Je griffe les murs, 
Pour me faire les ongles

Joseph Cotton,"My dream last night was about Ali Baba
With the forty thieves
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
he was there with me

I rode through the valley with the princess by my side
The Duke and the Duchess was there to meet me with a smile

Alice was there in a Wonderland
Staring far away
The three blind mice was there with me
To tell the Teddybear the tale

The Teddybear came smiling there with a big smile
The little Bo-peep has lost a sheep last night

Joseph Coyne,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

Waiting for your hands to find

Of a life I lived providing
What it was you needed most

And if everything is measured by the hole it leaves behind
Then this mountain has been leveled
And there's no more diamonds in the mine

Who danced both edges of the knife

Not knowing what you want
And the secrets we're defending
Have become our only bond

Just be patient while I wait here

And even on our worst days
We were never quite like this
We've gone as far as we can go
Without crashing

At the heart of every fool
Cause they hope you're stupid too
And there's this lingering, this lingering feeling
That I'm missing something, I feel like I'm missing something

Still beats for you
It will not rest, so
Meet me in our secret place

Beat you out of your own trap and I'll
Show you how much you have missed truth in

You gave the heart what it wanted most
You took your time and you made it clear
Maybe time will erase some things

Set me free
Leave me be

Joseph F. Burke,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,2009

Tú y yo ya nos casamos como 20 veces tuvimos

No veas que sueño con que me quieras

Esta tonta idea que tengo en mi mente creando mil historias

Empiezo a pensar que
Esto del amor es una fantasía
Y no me la creo
Que tú ya no te acuerdes
De todas las veces
Que te hice mía

Y todavía me exiges
Que olvide tu sonrisa
Y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias

Te hubieras ido antes
Por qué no te marchaste
Cuando aún no eras tan indispensable?
Me pides que te olvide
Cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme

Por qué diablos me obligaste a amarte
Y luego te alejaste?

You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.

Should pick the lowest brow which there's no doubt is me

Joseph Gershenson,"Me and my wife live all alone 
In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep. 

The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop, 
We'd better take another drop.",Little Brown Jug,1985

The seasons continue to pass. Spring became summer.
Fall dimmed into the winter's cold light

Society continued to erode as the people began to collapse
under the weight of economic despair

10 years had elapsed
since there had even been a blip of information
on the whereabouts of the mythical duo

Occasionally a story would be heard
a rumor from an unreliable source in a bar, or some place like that

Inevitably, it would be discounted as drunken hearsay
much like Area 51 or the Loch Ness Monster
until they were eventually proven to be true, of course

One by one the banks began to collapse again.
Politicians were running out of flocks to fleece.
The middle class had faded into irrelevance.
Anarchy had started to peek its head out

Snow
Oh, to see a great big man entirely made of snow

Where it's snowing 
All winter through
That's where I want to be
Snowball throwing
That's what I'll do
How I'm longing to ski
Through the snow-oh-oh-oh-oh

Those glist'ning houses that seem to be built of snow
Snow
Oh, to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow

What is Christmas with no snow
No white Christmas with no snow
Snow

I'll soon be there with snow
I'll wash my hair with snow
And with a spade of snow
I'll build a man that's made of snow
I'd love to stay up with you but I recommend a little shuteye
Go to sleep 
And dream 
Of snow
",Snow [From White Christmas],
Joseph Jaime,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,2005

Joseph Lilley & His Orchestra,"When the war was over, why, there were jobs galore
For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand
And it's not so hard to understand

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?

Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""
They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name

Nobody thinks of assigning him
When they stop wining and dining him
It seems this country never has enjoyed
So many one and two and three and four star generals

Say it again 
There's got to be a better way-yeah

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me

Floating out on the tide 
Following the river of death downstream 
Oh is it a dream?

A strange glow in the sky 
And nobody seems to know where you go?
And what does it mean? 
Oh is it a dream?

Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly, 
Suddenly burn so pale?

Is it a kind of shadow?

Wandering over the hills unseen 
Or is it a dream?

A cold sound in the air

And where do you start?

Joseph Patrick Moore,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California,2000
Joseph Patrick Moore,"The deception with tact, just what are you trying to say?
You've got a blank face, which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece
You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover so discreet, why don't they:

Do what they say, say what you mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another.

The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see comes from living close
To your fears
If this is up then I'm up but you're running out of sight
You've seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat
You run for cover and there's heat, why don't they:

Do what they say, say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
One thing leads to another

Then it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me
It's getting rough, off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough

Bigger the harder he falls
But when the wrong antidote is like a bulge on the throat
You runs for cover in the heat why don't they

Do what they say, say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You tell me something wrong, I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another",One Thing Leads to Another,2004

My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Joseph Welz,"You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love",The Elusive Butterfly,2007
Joseph White,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,2000

Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song

Never saw things going so right

When you're in love, my how they fly

All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

Sous le ciel gris de villes grises
Qui brisent mon pauvre coeur

Jamais d'espoir, jamais de joie
Notre âme ploie en sa douleur

Fermons les yeux, que tout s'efface
L'espace, redevient bleu

Dans l'infini qui tire le soleil d'Afrique,
Sur les tropiques luit sous le ciel d'Afrique,

Chaque instant semble meilleur qu'ailleurs
Et pour nous tout est désir, plaisir, au pays ensorceleur.
Son appel magique fait surgir devant nos yeux  des jeux,
Et des danses où toujours l’amour ,
Met son rythme plein de feu.

Une voix en moi s'élève
Et sans trêve, elle dit :
Tu ne dois chercher ton rêve
Loin du ciel de ton pays.

Sous le ciel d'Afrique,
Chaque instant semble meilleur qu'ailleurs
Et pour nous tout est désir, plaisir, au pays bleu du bonheur

Sous le ciel d'Afrique,
Chaque instant semble meilleur qu'ailleurs

Et pour nous tout est désir, plaisir, au pays bleu du bonheur !",Sous le Ciel d'Afrique,1992

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1996

And I'm a killa, so don't make me say it twice

Straight outta Memphis, can I get a witness
And I be lookin' for da chickens wit a thickness
I'm here forever, any kinda weather
You say you don't take advice, you fuckin' betta

'Cause if I see you, I'm creepin' up from behind
You betta hide, you on my side
You in my hood and I know I'm up on yo mind

I'll break it down, just like a pound
Of some of the prettiest ghetty tha you done found
I am the man, you are the lame
I'll fuck you up worse than the effect of a plane

This is the real, throw it like a field
Then get back off in da kitchen where you can chill

And all the othas, I kick it wit 'bout dey skrillas

Or shooting guns at old beer cans

Shooting birds in the fall
And laying in the truck bed with my girl
It’s the smell of mesquite campfire
Shooting Makers with the boys

A ring for her hand

Doesn't matter what band plays

Someday I might be worried about saving all my cash
But tonight, all I'm looking for are memories that last
There'll be time enough for serious

So I'm having fun while I'm young

I got my shots and looked down the bar
Suddenly, there you are
No one by your side and that just don't seem right

Do you wanna go somewhere, me and you?
It doesn't matter what we do
No promises or regrets
Girl, one kiss, we'll let the night take care of the rest""

Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness

Josh Abrahams,"I got two pale hands up against the window pane,
I'm shaking with the heat of my need again.
It starts in my feet, reverbs up to my brain,
There's nothing I can do to revert the gain.
I'm looking down to the street below, there's nothing in the way they move to show,
They too, know what I know, they too hunger for the beast below.
Listening to the radio, I feel so out of place,
There's a certain something missing that the treble can't erase.
I know you can tell just by looking at my face, a word about my weakness,
I'm totally addicted to bass.

Woah-woah-oh. Totally addicted to bass. Woah-woah-oh.
There's nothing I can do to be cool, I don't sleep til I've had my fuel,
It frustrates if I am deprived, a hunger that grates from deep inside.
I feel like I'm doing time, imprisoned by dependence on a rhythm sublime,
In my mind, I must overcome the need to define, the solitary silence of a faceless crime.
Standing by the stereo I'm feeling so alone,
My back against a speaker and I'm moving on my own.
Surrounded by so many and they're staring at my face,
They're picking up my problem, I'm totally addicted to bass.

woah-woah-oh. Totally addicted to bass. Woah-woah-oh.
Your bassline is shooting up my spine, woah-woah-oh,
Your bassline has got me feeling fine, it's filling up my mind.

Sunrise at my window, I look down on the street,
People I see everywhere are tapping their feet.
Suddenly I realise in a look that I was wrong,
Everybody's groovin to their own song.
Down at the scene below, there's something in the way they move to show,
They too, know what I know, they too hunger for the beast below.
Rhythm's running over me to wash away my fears,
The backbeat of humanity, it sweetens my tears.
There's something that's connected us down throughout the years,
No need to feel so lonely, everyone's addicted to bass.
Woah-woah-oh. Everyone's addicted to bass. Woah-woah-oh.

Your bassline is shooting up my spine, your bassline,
Your bassline has got me feeling fine, it's filling up my mind.

I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight
Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Where'd it all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
You and me were like a movie scene
Superstars playing in a teenage dream
There's no rewinding life tonight, tonight
Guess you could've broken someone else's heart
I'm the lucky winner because I played the part
Don't want to say goodbye tonight, tonight

Always be together 'til the very end

There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one

You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
Sometimes you gotta let things be
Even when the truth is that you lied to me
I want to keep these thoughts away, from me

It's the little things that I dream about
That no one ever talks about

And imagine what it’ll be like when summer does come.

Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I’ll be doing whatever snow does in summer.
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer.

I’ll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm.
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!
And I can’t wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.
Just imagine how much cooler I’ll be in summer.

Dah dah, da doo, uh bah bah bah bah bah boo

The hot and the cold are both so intense,
Put 'em together it just makes sense!

Rrr Raht da daht dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah doo

Winter’s a good time to stay in and cuddle,
But put me in summer and I’ll be a, happy snowman!

When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream,
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin’ off steam.

Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger's just increased

Well, we make our decorations out of flotsam and jetsam
Bake a yummy fruitcake, and you can't leave till you get some

(That went right through me)

Buy each other presents and then hide them very nimbly

Wait up for a chubby man to shimmy down your chimney
(Breaking and entering, ok on Christmas)

Oh, happy, merry, muletide barrels, faithful glass of cheer
Thanks for sharing what you do
At that time of year
Thank you

We knit scarves and sweaters and we wear our matching mittens
Don't forget the jammies that I knitted for my kittens
Eight nights in a row we light menorahs on our mantels

You cut down a tree and then you dress its corpse with candles
I love it

Anna and Elsa will have all that they need
I'll fill my sleigh here with the help of my steed
It'll be the best time of year
It's up to you
Up to me
Up to (mew)

Happy, merry, Mele Kaliki, holly, jolly, happy, tappy
A chubby man will soon appear and faithful friends, a tiny deer
And festive tidings, midnight clearing

I'll have to face it alone until tomorrow
And as your fading away 
I know it's a matter of hours til the tears begin 
Guess I'll turn out the lights and I'll settle in

For the restless night

I think I'm ready this time
I think I'm ready 
I'll lay down on this bed and then 
I'll imagine your touch and I'll see your face
And the shadows will come and surround this place

As your memory fades with no end in sight
It's a strong one and it holds on tight

I just turn around then they're gone
And when the night time goes 
It's long and lonely

Telluride, the snow fallin' down, I was wakin' up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive, I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride

We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire castin' shadows on the cabin wall,
Drownin' in desire
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud, so high up on that mountain,
I thought wed never come down
It was a dream we were livin' in and I was the happiest I'd ever been in

Telluride, the snow fallin' down, I was wakin' up in that sleepy little town
In her eyes my world came so alive, I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride

It ended just like a movie scene and I had to play the part
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave and me with the frozen heart


In Telluride, the snow fallin' down, standin' there alone in that sleepy little town
In her eyes, my world came so alive, I never will forget the day she said goodbye

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay

""If I had his money, I could do things my way?""
But little they know that it's so hard to find

Once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

Get along with you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm going do
I'm gonna quit my crying

Josh Groban,"O holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt His worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, let ever ever praise Thee

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai

Gli sembró piú dolce anche la morte
Guardó negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare

Potenza della lirica dove ogni dramma é un falso
Che con un pó di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano cosí vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Cosí diventa tutto piccolo anche le notti lá in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come lá scia di un'elica
Ma si é la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensó poi tanto

Josh Groban,"Il vento che soffia piano
Questa notte cambia il mio destino
E sento che il cuore ancora si sorprenderá

La vita ora ha piú senso
Se guardo questo cielo immenso
E la luna innamorata s'illuminerá di me, e sará

All'improvviso amore, come il mare
M'invade il cuore e l'anima e mi salverá
E sará naturale come respirare
L'aria in me, mi parlerá di te

Adesso tutto é diverso
Respiro te nell'universo
I tuoi occhi son due stelle nell'ocsuritá

All'improvviso amore, come il mare
M'invade il cuore e l'anima e mi salverá
E sará naturale come respirare
E sará vero amore, che guarisce il cuore
Luce dentro me, nascerá

E l'allegria, amica mia

Perche vai via?

Perche, perche?
Non cambiera niente lo so

And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And walked off to look for America

Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
And it took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said be careful his bow tie is really a camera

Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

Cathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why

Sleeping. Snow is softly falling.
Dreams are calling
Like bells in the distance.
We were
Dreamers.
Not so long ago.
But one by one
We
All had to grow up.
When it seems the magic slipped away.

We find it all again on Christmas Day.
Believe in what your heart is saying.
Hear the melody that's playing.
There's no time to waste.
There's so much to celebrate.

Believe in what you feel inside.
And give your dreams the wings to fly.
You have everything you need
If you just believe.
Trains move
Quickly.
To their journey's end.

Are where we begin again.
Ships go sailing.
Far across the sea.
Trusting starlight
To get where they need to be.

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto
Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensó alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianc scia di un'elica
Senti il dolore nella musica si alzó dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembró piú dolce anche la morte
Guardó negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima e lui credette di affogare
Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Potenza della lirica dove ogni dramma é un falso
Che con un pó di trucco e con la mimica puoi disventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano cosi vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Cosí diventa tutto piccolo anche le notti lá in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come lá scia di un'elica
Ma si é la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensó poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva giá felice e ricominció il suo canto

Rest your wings my butterfly
Peace will come to you in time
And I will sing this lullaby

No though I must leave, my child
But I would stay here by your side
And if you wake before I'm gone
Remember this sweet lullaby

And all love through darkness
Don't you ever stop believing
With love forlorn
With love you'll find your way

I leave this night with heavy heart
When I return to dry your eyes
I will send this lullaby

Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?

Hollow inside
Careful when worlds collide

I'll carry it on with pride

Josh Groban,"I knew a man who lived in fear
It was huge, it was angry
It was drawing near
Behind his house a secret place
Was the shadow of the demon
He could never face 

He built a wall of steel and flame
And men with guns to keep it tame
Then standing back he made it plain
That the nightmare would never ever rise again
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain 

It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round I heard
It slowly sound
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping 

And then one day the neighbors came
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame
They stood around outside the wall
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all
""My friends,"" he said, ""We've reached our goal
The threat is under firm control
As long as peace and order reign
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain"" 

It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping

See clouds arriving without warning

We can't stay like this forever
But I can have you next to me today

If I could make these moments endless
If I could stop the winds of change
If we just keep our eyes wide open
Then everything would stay the same

If I go on my way without you
Woah where would I go
If I go on my way without you
Woah where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva
Ties will never sever
You died tryin' to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin' in peace don't even stress that beef
Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Every time I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his body's underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus: x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

[Chorus]

Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin' nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin' clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

The stars are brightly shining.
It is the night
Of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt His worth.
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees,
Oh hear the angel voices;
Oh night divine,
Oh night when Christ was born,
Oh night divine, Oh night , Oh night divine.

Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother,
And in His name all oppression shall cease.

Let all within us praise His holy name.

Strength in my soul

Cause lately I've been feeling fine

Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?
Oh, you're a machine

A world of your own
Hollow inside
Careful when worlds collide

I'm filling my life
With all it can hold
I'll carry it on with pride

With the sound of our laughter
Montmartre hanged with flowers for far-forgotten hours

We laughed at common men for we were heroes then
And heaven smiled above

All those innocent hearts who imagined their arts
Could be casually mastered

For the sands of time have run away for each and all

For it seems that our schemes were impossible dreams
That could never have lasted
For when we woke at last the big parade had passed
And spring had gone its way

La boheme, la boheme
Someone to care, someone to mind
La boheme, la boheme
We were in love and love is blind

Now and then I return and the memories burn
With a bittersweet aching
I climb the same old stairs
But no-one longer cares

And there's no-one to greet in the streets where we walked
And the bars where we talked of a world we were making
I stand upon that hill until I drink my fill

No, I was going to leave that pleasure to you.
However, my friend, there is one thing-

Sure, but there are others beside Vassy we wish to see come home.

Tal vez no te borre en mi
Y sufrir en silencio
Silencio, silencio, silencio

Antes el sol era mi bendición
Ahora sus rayos me queman sin razón
Antes creía sin dudar en mi instinto
Ahora es tan frágil como un animal herido

Si tu no estas aquí
No hay manera de existir
Tengo que despertar
Tengo que revivir
Es un inmenso vació
Ya no hay amor aquí
Tal vez no te borre en mi
Y sufrir en silencio
Silencio

Donde el sol no duerme mas
Y el alma libre va
Yo te esperare
Y será hasta la eternidad
Amor mío

Si tu no estás aquí
No hay manera de existir
Tengo que despertar
Tengo que revivir
Es un inmenso vació
Ya no hay amor aquí
Tal vez me debo rendir
Y sufrir en silencio
Silencio, silencio, silencio

Si tu no estás aquí
Si tu no estás aquí
Si tu no estás aquí
Ooh",Silencio,2009
Josh Groban,"Ora di andarmene
Il momento che
Questo cuore teme
E'difficile
Un coltello che
Ti lacera

Credimi
Fa più male dentro
Il dover andarsene
Sapere che
Tu soffri come soffro
Quando è l'ora dell'addio

Se a volte pensi che
La mia scelta sia
Segno che non ti amo
Non odiarmi mai
Vado per la tua
Felicità

Credimi
Fa più male dentro
Il dover andarsene
Sapere che
Tu soffri come soffro
Quando è l'ora dell'addio

Com'è difficile ignorare le memorie di una vita
Tutto mi ricorda come sei parte di me

Credimi
Fa più male dentro
Il dover andarsene
Sapere che
Tu soffri come soffro
Quando è l'ora dell'addio",L' Ora Dell'addio,2010
Josh Groban,"Retournons avant la guerre
Avant la fin
Avant le besoin de toutes ces prieres
Aucun mal
Aucun bien
Aucun mot croche
Ni mots malins que l'on dit quand on n'sait pas

Sous un ciel bleu, ciel sans nuage
Retournons la-bas
Sans orage
Retournons la-bas
Au jardin des sans pourquoi

Je t'ai vue te promener la-bas
Sous l'arc-en-ciel
Brillante comme une etincelle dans la nuit
Ou je t'ai vue aussi
Tombant du ciel
Comme une larme de st laurent, disparaissant
Dans un ciel blue, ciel sans nuage
Retournons la-bas
Sans orage
Retournons la-bas
Au jardin des sans pourquoi",Au Jardin Des Sans Pourquoi,2010
Josh Groban,"There's a pale winter moon in the sky coming through my window
And the park is laid out like a bed below
It's a cold, dark night and my heart melts like the snow
And the bells of New York City tell me not to go

It's always this time of year that my thoughts undo me
With the ghosts of many lifetimes all abound
But from these mad heights I can always hear the sound
Of the bells of New York City singing all around

Stay with me, stay with me
Refuge from these broken dreams
Wait right here oh wait with me
On silent snow filled streets

Sing to me one song for joy and one for redemption
And whatever is in between that I call mine
With the street lamp light to illuminate the gray
And the bells of New York City calling me to stay
The bells of New York City calling me to stay",Bells of New York City,2010
