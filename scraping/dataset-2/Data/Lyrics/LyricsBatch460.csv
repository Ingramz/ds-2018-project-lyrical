",Wherever I Go,2003
Jimmy Jones,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1954
Jimmy Jones,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down",Good Morning Heartache,1954
Jimmy Jones,"Intro-conversations mingled in a crowded room
???? at the club tonight. Ole Richard went home early-he's got the key to the 
house. I'm gonna knock on the door, see if I kin get in.

Open the door, Richard!! Ya see, Richard sleeps in the back room. It's kinda hard 
to hear. 
Maybe I better knock a little louder.

Open the door, Richard!! I don't think Richard heard me yet. Knock one more 
time-let's see 
what's gonna happen.

Richard, open the door, please.
	SUNG: Open the door, Richard
		Open the door and let me in
		Open the door, Richard
		Richard, why don't you open that door?

Richard, open the door, man-it's *co-hold* out here'n this air. Now look-there's that 
old woman 'cross the street lookin' out the windah
	(Who's that, Widow Sweet?)
That must be her sister, I guess. She wants to make SURE this is me. She's tryin' 
to find out 
what's happenin'. Yes, it's me and I'm late again!
	(??, did you hear what the lady's sayin'?)
No, what is she sayin'?
	(She said you sure look common out here'n the street.)
COMMON? Man, I got class I ain't never used yet. I'm gonna knock again-
Richard's got to get up.

Open the door, Richard!! Man, you got a key to the house?
	(No, ??, I don't have a key. I DON'T have a key.)
Somebody's got to get in the house. We can't climb in the transit.
	(Oh, I know he's in there.)
How YOU know he's in there?
	(I can hear him breathin'.)
Ooooh, let's try it one more time!

Richard, open that door, man. Maybe Richard's gone. 
	SUNG: Open the door, Richard
		Open the door and let me in
		Open the door, Richard
		Richard, why don't you open that door?  

I know he's in there. 
	(how you know he's in there?)
Why, you got on the suit.
	I know I got on the only suit. Ain't got but one suit between us. That's the 
reason why I don't like to roooooom with nobody.

Richard, why don'tcha open the door, man?","Open the Door, Richard",1999
Jimmy Jones,"Gee, how I miss
Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Now I run my hands
Through silvery strands,
You left me blue turning gray over you.

You used to be
So good to me,
That's when I was a novelty.

Now, you've new friends in view,
You've found someone new,
And left me blue turning gray over you.",Blue Turning Grey over You,2000
Jimmy Jones,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2000
Jimmy Jones,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2000
Jimmy Jones,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You,2000
Jimmy Jones,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with

I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't care to go
I'm home about eight

Like no one's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
Deep as a river

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you'll let me

You're gonna love me

We'll build a dream house so lovely
Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way, dear

The tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love
My moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly
Holding you close to me

Jimmy Jones,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

I keep wishing I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing 

I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring,2001
Jimmy Jones,"You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you phone
You don't and I'm left alone.

Sing the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me",Mean to Me,2001
Jimmy Jones,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

'Neath a starry sky

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one

Take a walk wit us on our block man, See how we live, DIP SET!

Yo, yo, Come on home wit me, early '90's it wasn't pearly and shiney
I was so damn grimey
'Cause I ain't have no fresh clothes
Or jewelry wit the X's O's

My house had asbestos
I'm fixin' up a 60 pack, wit a kitty cat
Mice run around the damn sticky trap
Come on home wit me, where my mother found my crack platter

Threw it away so I snapped at her, back slapped her
She picked up a bat, like McGwuier for that matter
Hit me, I was back at her
Come home where I duck the DT's

Line around the corner, but I'm gettin' the free cheese
Come on home wit me, where I stand on my post
Play wit my toast, Been here wit mayonaise and toast
And pepper, many nights I done slept wit a heefer

Any beef came it left on a stretcher KILLA!
Come on home wit me, where they rapidly flossin'
Where I begged Kim to have the abortion
Money, brown bag, extortion

Caution, where there's tragedy often
Relax in a coffin
And the bitch know I'm serious
'Cause I'm never scared ma, unless you miss ya period

So come home wit me
Where the girls want to come home wit me
They say ""Cam if you need dome hit me!""
Love to see the chrome wit me

The car a quarter mil, on the wheels I done blown 50
Dice games blown 50, Jones loan 60
Had crack stones swiftly, Took it home wit me
So come home wit me, where a nigga make star bucks

I'm about to cop a +Starbucks+
I'm the first one wit hard luck
Now I'm at the dealer buying cars...trucks
Aww shucks!

Yo come home wit me
To the streets, the slums, the ghettos
That's come to me
Every night my girl crying ""Come home to me""

No! Come home wit me
Where there's so many cops that the block is boiling
The food is spoiled, but that pot wit the rock is boiling
Same pot mommy cook wit, left the oil in

Come home wit me, where these bitches is frauds
Niggas don't listen to broads
They have you sittin' in court wit kids that ain't yours
Come home wit me, where every day the glocks go pop

Where the front door is broke, and them locks don't lock
Come home wit me, dog where the beef is seekin'
Kid's don't trick or treat, they get +tricked+ for +treating+
Come home wit me, where the pistols squeezing

Where niggas twist the cheekin, ripped to pieces are kids get even
Come home wit me, don't leave ya condoms behind
'Cause bitches leave them martians behind
Pray to God that I'm fine

Come on home wit me, come on zone wit me
Come on walk through this cold city
Where these kids need food
Niggas need God, and some bitches need rules

Come on home wit me, where niggas livin' off they last buck
Phonies off, rentings backed up
Come on home wit me, niggas strap up
Hit the streets gats up

Clap up, and get they money back up
Come on home wit me, every block got a crack in it
Every hallway gotta a nigga wit some crack in it
So don't get trapped in it

Come on home wit me, where my parents wit um...
Leave me alone
So early I was free to just rome
Wit 7 keys to the home

11 trees to the dome
13 I ran the streets wit the chrome
Come on home wit me, where the buses don't run
And my dog stay bustin his gun

Think that gettin' caught by justices is fun
Keep a blade up in they gums
This is Harlem, where the fuck is you from?
Uh, come on home wit me every few minutes was a knock on the door

Fiends come coppin' the raw
Clothes, kicks, socks on the floor
Mommy like ""Be quiet because I really think them cops at the door!""
There's some locks on the door

Come on home wit me, grandmothers is 30
One gram on that butter is 30
Sold grams wit my cousin birdy
School, cutting it early

Don't stutter motherfuckers you heard me
Come on home wit me, these are the facts

Yo, yo, yo, the way I been treated in this industry? Not nicely
Little faggot motherfucker like (*Mike Lightly*)

Getting robbed dog, is not my game
My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang
Reversed the situation, popped his chain
Be happy we ain't pop his brain
Aiyoo, I treat that show money, Mike..
Like it's coke money, aight?
So you better have it, consequence could be a casket

You know, re-in up, and fillin' up them pots with cocaine
Then you chop it up, and bottle up and top the cocaine
Got watch for the cops and dey chains
For them diplomatic affairs, automatic'll flare
I whips everything from automatics to gears
Yeah, you know sticks I clutch 'em
Shots with 6 I bust em, cop kicks to scuff 'em
Fuck 'em, hop out the 6 and crush 'em
Hop in the 6 and dust 'em, BOOM

Jimmy Joyce & His Children's Chorus,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star,2008

Well its plain that youre lyin
When you say that youve been cryin

I wanted to be proud of you when we walked down the street
Now dont ask me to dress you up, in satin and in silk

But as his fame grew she was pushed aside,
So the mountain girl would say good-bye,
To the folk singer,
He let his hair grow long and he dressed in style,

His voice was pure and the fans went wild,
For the folk singer,
He said Sara Jane was much too plain,
So he left her alone as grew more fame,
But sorrow will come like a mountain rain,

Lavished in glory, fortune at his feet,

Thousands wept, Sara Jane did too,
He could not sing now his friends were few,

Now Sara Jane didn't look so plain,

Oh the power of love can do strange things,
Cause love has made him sing again,

Better bring my money baby nobody is gonna stop me
I'll fill 'em up with that hot shit
Bullets all in your body better watch me wicked posse
Yeah, automatic shotguns half of these rappers talkin
Ain't none of 'em ever popped one
Little kid from South View who would've thought that I'd make it
And the people ain't behind me my family's kinda freakish
That thuggish ruggish, nigga from Columbus
And this is the way we play spread your rumors
I just love it do it all day everyday
Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned
Cleveland they show me love, they still wonderin how
I made it up outta the famine better believe it baby, baby
Should a listened to my people, still runnin from demons and evil

I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em  some soap man that's for all the times you played me
Old man this is your son with a blunt and a gun
Check out my slow jam

Those that love me if you leave me
I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man
Those that love me if you leave me

The smell of the prairie after it rains
Buffalo gals and laughter times ten

Bob Dylan records, the carnival crowd
Beautiful ladies, forgiveness of sin
The feeling I get when I see you again

Thoughts way up high, the moon hanging low
Abandoned bus stations, AM radio
Beat generation, highways that bend
The feeling I get when I see you again

Trains late at night, traveling shoes
Dogs in the country moaning the blues
Lost on the landscape, my thumb in the wind

Yes the feeling I get just to see you again

Jimmy LaFave,"I went driving, on the northern plains
I went rolling through the fields of grain

I thought about you, can't live without you
No matter how I try
There's something sacred
The way the tears fall from your eyes

I went flying, in a big jet plane
Across the ocean, just to know your name

Island princess, it's my heart's concern
I should've never said goodbye
There's something sacred
When the tears fall from your eyes

Let 'em fall, let 'em fall on me
Let 'em fall, let 'em set me free

I went dreaming and I saw your face
And in that moment, I was touched by grace

And all alone now, I hear the wolves howl
And it makes me wonder why
There's something sacred
When the tears fall from your eyes

It's always sacred
The way the tears fall from your eyes
There's something sacred
The way the tears fall from your eyes

I wanna hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find

For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing
It would make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

Diddy, da da, la da da, da da da
Ya da da, da da, la da

When rain has hung the leaves with tears

Because it is heavy heart for me 
But I want to gaze at you 
Please gaze at me tonight forever more

Ahead lies mystery

To write the words again 
That all in love is fair

In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my old home
For dad and mother were called to heaven
I's left in this world all alone

I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live

High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot in my memory

Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows

I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home

Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
But his body was never found

Now I'm right with God so I'm travelling home

To me his voice sounds sweet and low
For me I hear my loved ones cheering

Jimmy Martin & the Sunny Mountain Boys,"Some people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink wine leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine

I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to bluest of blue

I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their wine
So, if you refuse me, my poor heart will pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live dear, you'll still hear me cry

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Jimmy McHugh,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

Of the motor's repeat

""I don't want nobody else
I love you"", She's lying
""There won't be somebody else
and that's true"", She's lying
""say you'll always be my friend
sweet darling""
Why does she pretend?
Ain't no doubt, it's plain to see
A woman like you's no good for me
Your heart's beating at another door
I'm a done fool for to ask for more

She says ""It's like in a song, remember?
If you love someone, set them free
Well, that's how it is for me""
And then she kisses me
and somewhere I hear a door slam
So I say ""fine""
And just hope that I'm a better liar than she is

Jimmy Nail,"Words and music by jimmy nail

Walking on cobble stone, little bits of skin and bone
Jumping on the tram car for a ride
I can remember then, I was just a boy of ten
Hanging out along the old quayside
Not all the capstans and the cargo boats
And stevadores are gone
To where all the old ships go
But memories just like the seas live on

That was when coal was king,
The river a living thing
And I was just a boy, but it was mine,
The coaly tyne

This was a big river,
I want you all to know that I was proud
This was a big river, but that was long ago,
That's not now, that's not now

My fther was a working man,
He earned our living with his hands
He had to cross the river every day
He picked up a union card out of the neptune yard
Mouths to feed and the bills to pay
Then came a time for him to sail across the sea
And far away
Finally when the war was won
You brought him home and home he stayed

And when his days were done, under a golden sun
You carried him to where he longed to be,
Back to the sea

This was a big river,
I want you all to know that I was proud
This was a big river, but that was long ago,
That's not now

The neptune was the last to go,
I heard it on my radio
And then they played the latest number one
But what do they do all day?
And what are they supposed to say?
What does a father tell his son?
If you you believed that there's a bond between our future
And our past
Then try to hold on to what we had,
We build them strong, we built to last

'cause this is a mighty town,
It's built upon solid ground
And everything they tried so hard to kill,
We will rebuild

This was a big river
I want you all to know that I was proud
This was a big river, but that was long ago,
That's not now
This is a big river,
And in my heart I know it will rise again
The river will rise again

Where all that I feel I am learning 
Oh life, has been turned on the lathe 
Reshaped with a flame that's still burning 
And in time, it's all a sweet mystery 
When you shake the tree of temptation 
Yeah and I, I know the fear and the cost 
Of a paradise lost in frustration 

And the flame still burns 
It's there in my soul for that unfinished goal 
And the flame still burns 
From a glimmer of then 
It lights up again in my life

I, I want my thoughts to be heard 
The unspoken words of my wisdom 
Today, as the light starts to flow 
Tomorrow who knows who will listen 
But my life has no language of love 
No word from above is appearing

With a reason of hope and believing

Jimmy Nail,"Ah, me name is Jackie White and I'm foreman of the yard,
And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
Why I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if yer late,
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide.
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift,
And I'd expect ye's all to back us to the hilt.
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late,
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built.
We built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen,
Super tankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen,
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

All the platers and the welders, and the boiler making crews,
When they see that bugger finished on the slipway,
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not,
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day.
It's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen,
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday.
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in yer stride,
But you wonder if you'll see another payday.

For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride,
And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide,
For there's a sadness in the leavin' and ye worry what's ahead,
And that worry never leaves ye, keeps on nagging in yer head,
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till yer dead…
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed,
And the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And I don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Adrian Sanderson and riveting's me trade,
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for,
And I may forego English grammar when I'm injured with a hammer,
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor.

I've read the Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well,
I read Tacitus and Pliny and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
I put a night shift in with Dante on his journey into Hell,
And that's what we'll all be facing if the yard's put up to sell,
For the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Now what about those Trojan wars? And the troubles that they caused?
When they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?

[Tommy Thompson]
Aye, the ship they had was crap and they'd lost the effin' map,
When they tried to get their selves back to the toon.

[Adrian Sanderson]
There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past,
Just like in ""Spartacus"" that film by Stanley Kubrick.
First it's tragedy then farce then they'll kick you in the arse,
When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris.

Well it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhymin' and the meter,
And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard.
If I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time,
All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme,
And I never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime,
And rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime,
But the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union,
Me dream is proletarian revolution,
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others,
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution.

Das Kapital's me bible and the ruling class are liable,
And quoting Marx and Engels, it's entirely justifiable,
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

So it's a one-day stoppage, or an overtime ban,
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan.
'Til the means of production are safely in our hands,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards,
When they try to close us down like other shipyards.
And if industrial action only helps the competition,
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position,
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition,
Well ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns!
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard.

My name is Peggy White,
And I've nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds I've bound.
Busted arms, and busted heads,
Broken backs and broken legs,
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground.
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung,
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue,
I could give you's all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs,
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Arthur Cook, I'm the Union superintendent,
Where I represent the interests of ye's all.
And I listen to you men as you talk about the future,
But the truth is that we're heading for a God almighty fall.
But it's clear that intervention's not the government's intention,
'Cos they've got no need for ships, now have I got your full attention?
While the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension,
I'm the one who sees the writin' on the shipyard wall.

I've begged and I've pleaded at every meeting that we've held,
That we limit our demands to this reality,
It's like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld,
And there's nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity.
There's nowt for us to bargain with when the industry's at sea,
It must be obvious to you as it's obvious to me,
And my advice to all of you's is to take redundancy,
And accept that there's no future in this shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two,
You could ask me when it started but I haven't got a clue.
I'm never sad or miserable I'm never ever blue,
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard.

I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds,
And then the missus starts complainin' about all me drunken deeds,
Like when I got the train to Sunderland but found meself in Leeds,
And I had to get up early for the shipyard.

I once gave up the drinking, was it 1963?
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me,
It was the worst three hours I ever hope to see…

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And the ship sets sail and the tale gets told,
And the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll get the bastard finished, and we'll end up on the dole.
And we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
The only life we've ever known is in the shipyard.",Shipyard,2013
Jimmy Nail,"Good people give ear to me story,
Pay attention, and none of your lip,
For I've brought you five lads and their daddy,
Intending to build ye's a ship.
Wallsend is wor habitation,
It's the place we was all born and bred.
And there's nay finer lads in the nation,
And none are more gallantly led.

What have we got, but the buzzer in the morning?
Aye, and what have we got, but the laying of a keel?
And what have we got, but the cranes above us soaring?
The commotion and the clamour in the welding of the steel?

What have we got, but the mist upon the river?
Tell me, what have we got, but the noise inside the hold?
Oh, what have we got, but the arse end of the weather?
Where we work in horizontal rain, and shiver in the cold.

What have ye got, but the singing in the cables?
Oh, what have ye got, but the ringing in your ears?
Aye, what have ye got, but the telling of the fables?
And the memories of the ships, that we've been building donkey's years.

What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt. We've got nowt else.

What do ye got? (What do we got?)

Aye, you've got to die of something,
It's written in your fate,
Ye may as well die of a Tuesday,
And woe betide you're late.

What have ye got, all you men what's fit and able?
What have ye got, for the straining in your neck?
What have ye got, when you're laid out on the table?
And the snapping of a cable when the rigging hits the deck?

What have ye got, but the loyalty of brothers?
What have ye got, but this union of the dock?
What have ye got, a bacon sandwich from your mother?
Not a promise of another with the punching of the clock.

What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt. We've got nowt else.

It's the beginning of my end, you gotta promise me
How can a Holy God renew a wicked Pharisee 
I'm saying, I'm like Peter in the boat so just depart from me
It seems I'm destined for doom like ancient prophesy 
And in the dark I'm consumed it's just to much for me
With sin in full bloom my gloom booms by the full moon
And I'm thinking to myself how can you rescue me?

I can't but sing
My before and after
I'll sing praises to my King
My before and after
Here's the anthem let it ring
One love two arms three scars 
Draw us to where you are
No one is too far for you to save a heart

Then in the darkness of this room you snuck up next to me
You put your hand upon my wound and whispered rest in me
And there I stepped out of the tomb and into destiny 
The rest they say is history 
Your grace is such a mystery

[Chorus]

I got a name change
And that's the strange thing

Take me there

Yeah.
Tell me have you ever seen a 
Brother so weighted you can tell by his demeanor
That he's really jaded tryna get out this arena
He longs for something greater but they say he's just a dreamer
But he has a treasure that he holds like gold
'Cause he knows something that them boys don't know
Nothing seems funny when his money's so low 
But when he thinks about the place man he really wants to go

That he ain't all obsessed with the cash he can stack 
Because he's looking to the heavens where his master is at
But he does have treasure and he's storing it up
Seems foreign to us, it can't be stolen or rust

So when the cares of this world start weighing on him hard
And he's tired of the bills hes been paying on his car
He can't wait to be embraced by the Lord face to face
So he waits for his reward and he sings:

[Chorus]

Tell me have you ever seen her?
She's sick with a disease and it's really tryna beat her
Its taken all her strength 
She knows that it can't defeat her
'Cause she gon' be with Jesus
She's more than just a dreamer.

Her peace and her joy man it really ain't gone 
It's all because she knows earth really ain't home
And even when she's by herself she really ain't alone
Her Savior's there with her while she's singing this song

She knows sickness might get her
And death might grab her
But she ain't scared of death 'cause she's trusting in the master
Was buried but he rose up a few days after
So death might attack her but death cannot have her

So she tells her family, ""don't worry anymore""
When she's gone from the body she'll be present with the Lord
Her body will be raised, so much glory is in store
He is her reward so she sings

[Chorus]

Hey I don't know about you but I can wait till the day
When I'll be with my Lord and everything is OK
And I'll be just like him so sin won't get in the way
Basking in his glory that's where I want to stay

I place where shadows give way to the real
And circumstances can't change the way that I feel
Joy in my Savior that Satan can't steal 
Because he's been defeated- yeah you know the deal

The Real Good Life
I can't wait please take me soon
Until them I'll be praising in the waiting room
Fighting by his grace
Can't wait to embrace the groom
Until then I'm like:

In times of trouble
When I’m not able
You are, my God, You are
My chains are broken
Your gates are open
Hallelujah

You are the hope that broke the dark in me
You are the light that shines when I can’t see
You are, You are, You are

Jimmy Needham,"I’ve never seen anything like Your fountain
Comin’ down from the tip of the mountaintop
And it goes, never stops, only overflows
I’ve never met anyone with the power
To make a desert bloom like a flower
Up and it goes, where it stops, only Heaven knows
Never known anyone as wonderful as You are

Over and over
You fill my heart with wonder
You take me by surprise
I can’t believe my eyes
Wider and deeper
Just when I think I’ve seen You
Like a stone thrown into the ocean water
I could search Your depths
And never hit rock bottom

How can the God of the galaxies
Have a care for the little things
Every tear that I cry, every time that I smile
Deep in me You’ve created a fire
Like a friend You keep taking me higher
Up and it grows, where it stops, only Heaven knows
Never known anyone as wonderful as You are

Even though I’m plungin’ in the depths of Your love
I’m just scratchin’ the surface of who You are
All the seas in all the world cannot contain all that You are
You captivate my heart",Rock Bottom,2012
Jimmy Needham,"You lead me like the dawning of the day
You lead me like April leads into May
You lead me like the stone You rolled away
You take my hand and we will run away

Just like a child I rest upon Your knee
Just like a song, Your love, it sings to me
Inside Your arms I find a symphony
You take my hand and then we run away

To the place where my fears have no voice at all
Only sound in my ear, the whisper of Your call
This moment is frozen
I’m not going anywhere
I’d linger forever
If only I could stay here

Remember all those years ago we met
All I recall are days of past regret
And You felt so far but I had never left
Just wanting You to take my hand and run

To the place where my fears have no voice at all
The only sound in my ear, the whisper of Your call
This moment is frozen
I’m not going anywhere
I’d linger forever
If only I could stay

In the place where my fears have no voice at all
Only sound in my ear, the whisper

Jimmy Neely,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou,1960
Jimmy Neely,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1960

And that ain't good

Not made of wood

We pray some, and sin some

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1961
Jimmy Neely,"Why am I sitting alone tonight,
when I could be out where the lights are bright?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
Why am i wasting these precios years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

(Chorus):
Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him.
Sometimes when I get feeling low,
I say ""Let's call it quits.""
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart in bits.
Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me,
But even if he does you can believe me,
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim.",Jim,1961

Jimmy Neely,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1961
Jimmy Neely,"My heart is heavy as lead
Because the blues has done spread
Rocks in my bed

Of all the people I see
Why do they pick on poor me
And put rocks in my bed

All night long I weep
So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed

There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man

And ain't goin' bring him back

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Tell me what d'you see
Well if you're down my way
It could well be me
Stood on your corner
I'm nearly down on one knee
Can you hear me calling for you
So damn easy to see
And it can't be forever
And it won't be for long
So don't you think that it's better
We speak the same tongue
Out here in this weather
We must surely belong
Birds of a feather
Whatever the song:
Please give me a lift man
It can't be for far
The way that you shift man
In your empty car,
I've got the highway blues
In my holy (holey, wholly) shoes
And I cannot choose
What I look like
And I got here from yesterday
On porridge and bait
Swallowing sorrow
Following fate
Poaching tomorrow
From God and the state
Of homo his shadow
The well known long haired straight
But I've got a good reason
For being this way
I'm happy for certain
And hoping to stay
Travelling trust
Across the new day
Gathering dust
Down your highway
Please give me a lift man...
It can't be for far
The way that you shift man
In your empty car
I've got the highway blues
In my holy shoes
And I cannot choose
What I look like
Out on the streets
Or where my drum beats
In between the clean sheets
Of my love life
And I need little Margaret
Out here again
Screwing some traffic
From the shaven insane
With thumbs like a dragnet
She pulls like a train
And she looks like a magnet;
And she comes like a warm rain
Please give me a lift man...",Highway Blues,1986
Jimmy Page,"If I cannot be so happy without you, my dear
If I cannot hold you close, evr'y second that you're here
You must know I can't go on, ev'ry time I sing my song
If I cannot have your love, I'll sing the blues

Every time I'm feeling low and far away
All the time I think of you every second of the day
And you know you hurt my pride but I'd rather be by your side
If I cannot have your love, I'll sing the blues

Sing the blues all my life, I got trouble, I got strife
How can a man expect to be so free
To travel this so lonely road and to carry it's heavy load
Is becoming far too much, too much for me

If I cannot be so happy, then I'm gonna be on my way
The many nights I needed your love, it never worked out that way
For I must have my babe, for I'm feeling extremely sad
If I cannot have your love, I'm gonna play the blues

Sing the blues all my life, so much trouble, so much strife
How can a man expect to be so free
To travel this so lonely road and to carry its heavy load
I rather have your love, than sing the blues

Yes, I rather have your love than sing the blues
Yes, I rather have your love, baby, than sing the blues

An´ I can´t hide the loneliness no more
All the tears I´ve cried, all the love I´ve been denied
An´ still you find me waiting on you, baby, baby, babe

Well, to me, you know, it don't matter no how,
All I gotta do is call your name,
Well then I've got,
My baby.
You know I've got,
My baby.

And when I work hard each and every day,
When I come home my baby has a lot to say,
Most of what she tells me is that she's mine,
Cause you know I've got,
My baby.

I remember when my world, came falling down
Out there the stars stop dancing
Lost in my darkness now, the rain keeps falling down

Light of my life, where have you gone
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun

Here comes the blue train rollin'
Across my heart it crawls, the rain still pouring down
Another day escapes me
A little later maybe, love will roll around

Light of my life, where have you gone
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun

I've been waiting on a corner
Yeah, I've been waiting for a sign now
Oh, I've been waiting on the corner
I've been waiting for a sign now, oh, now

Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life

Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny

With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion

We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

High in the sky up above

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

Jimmy Raney,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Jimmy Raney,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Never were as blue as his eyes

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

That you can't see
Your future with me

Jimmy Raney,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun.

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Jimmy Raney,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Jimmy Raney,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You? [Live],2000
Jimmy Raney,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Everything I've Got,2005

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss
